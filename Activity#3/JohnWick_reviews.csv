"lnvicta","6 May 2015","The best way I can describe John Wick is to picture Taken but instead of Liam Neeson it's Keanu Reeves and instead of his daughter it's his dog. That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.As an action movie buff, all I wanted to see in this movie is some inventive action sequences, and I was not disappointed. Every single action sequence in this movie is fast-paced, beautifully shot, fluid, intense, and you never have trouble understanding what's going on. The direction of this film is fantastic, as is the writing. There's no melodramatic soapy story lines - everything is straight and to the point, and the point is to get to the action. Not one moment in this movie is boring. The short dialogue is effective from getting to action sequence A to sequence B without any confusion as to any character's motive. It's all laid out in front of you - all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the insanity happening on screen.Remember when Live Free or Die Hard came out and people were upset that John McClane only fired pistols throughout the entire movie? I like a little versatility when it comes to action heroes, and evidently so do the writers. John Wick wrecks face with pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, knives, even mano-a-mano; the man can do anything. The difference between John Wick and other modern action movies (Die Hard 5 and Taken 3 for instance) is that you actually believe John Wick is killable. He's not some invincible superhero like Bruce Willis was in Die Hard 5, having his car crash and flip like a hundred times and the second it stops he gets out without a scratch and starts running. No, John Wick takes a beating in this film. Numerous times in fact. But most of the time he's kicking ass and taking names, and instead of acting as some unstoppable killing machine, he just seems like a guy who's an expert in his field. He used to be a hit-man after all.John Wick is a blast to watch. Really, it's just a mindlessly fun action movie. It has large-scale shootouts, CQC sequences, and a classic hero-villain hand-to-hand confrontation at the end. The only negative I can say about the movie is that the villains aren't anything to write home about. They're Russian mobsters which we've seen a million times, and their leader isn't given enough to work with as far as character goes. Willam DaFoe has a brief but important role though as Wick's former colleague. Regardless, John Wick is all about the action and it goes above and beyond in every respect. It's a breath of fresh air after all the poor sequels we've been getting, and thankfully John Wick has the potential to be the next great action franchise. An absolute must-watch for action fans.","

"CountJonnie","17 January 2015","It looks as if the filmmakers realized that the public was sick of certain movies. Most movies nowadays are full of wire work, sci-fi, etc. often topped with icing made of needless or predictable background stories that add nothing. For example the beautiful girlfriend who gives the moral speeches or the troubled teenage daughter, who aren't present here.Nothing of that is in John Wick. John Wick adds hardly a story, no character development, no needless character or background, no misplaced drama, no misplaced humor and not too much eye candy, nothing of that. What John Wick offers is action, action and more action. In fact, it is one long action scene, with some lines and close ups added. But that is not a problem. The directors promise action and deliver. While delivering they made it look good and convincing, without trying to be more, and they're smart enough to give the movie a satisfying beginning and ending.And for those who claim that Keanu Reeves is a horrible actor..... you are right. But his blank expression is perfect for this movie. Leave the acting to the bad guys and the delicious guest part for Willem Dafoe.If you're tired of movies with forced drama or loaded with CGI, John Wick will be a pleasant wake-up call.","

"Coventry","5 May 2023","With the fourth installment scoring immensely at the cinemas as I'm submitting this review, and after three previous films that are apparently loved by everyone else in the world, I thought perhaps it would be time for me check out ""John Wick"".But, even though I'm late to the party as usual, I don't feel like I've missed out on a lot. ""John Wick"" is a fast-paced and adrenaline-rushing action flick, but not the traditional type of action movie, like ""Die Hard"" or ""Lethal Weapon"". Since a good fifteen years or so, there seemingly exists an additional new sub-genre within the world of action/thriller cinema, which is best described as ""Shoot 'em Up"" films, and ""John Wick"" neatly fits into this category. Other examples include ""Shoot 'em Up"", - duh - , ""Crank"", ""Hardcore Henry"", ""Free Fire"", ""Taken"" and ""Everly"". You guessed it; - these are films with very thin plots and without any proper character development, but they primarily focus on non-stop violent action, excessively over-the-top gunfire action and a practically immeasurable body count. They are entertaining if you're in a completely undemanding mood, I reckon, but they are quite unmemorable as well. Moreover, despite all the action and bloodshed, these films are sort of boring, because they constantly repeat the same old ""bang-bang-you're-all-dead"" routine.The most interesting aspects about ""John Wick"" are definitely the structural framework and background stories the script constantly hints at. The rudimentary plot of an invincible and stoic hitman coming out of retirement to extract vengeance of a personal nature is really old and has been told hundreds of times before. The organization in which our protagonist operates, however, is intriguing to say the least. He knows everyone, both the ones supporting him and the ones he's shooting up, there's a sort of code of conduct that includes the use of specific coins and the respect of neutral zones, the cleaning up bloody shootout aftermaths is referred to as diner reservations, and even the local law enforcer doesn't seem surprised when John answers the door with a bloodied face. None of these particularities ever get explained, but then again, there are at least three more films.The sole thing to bear in mind when watching a film like ""John Wick"" remains: don't ask yourself any questions. Where does the never-ending supply of redundant henchmen keeps coming from? Why can't anyone hit a target expect for the hero? Why engage into a fistfight when there's a possibility for a clean shot? Why capture your target instead of killing him straight away, for that matter? You know he'll just escape again and kill you instead. Most importantly, why didn't anyone at least try to apologize to Wick for murdering his puppy?If you seek logic and answers to these questions, ""John Wick"" is a terrible film. In case you accept what it is, there's entertainment aplenty thanks to the impressive stunt work, the solid performances by Keanu Reeves and the supportive cast, inventive little gimmicks, and a whole lot of mean people that get punished for making the wrong career choices in their lives.","

"Kitsfi","28 September 2018","John wick has a very simple revenge story. It can be summarized as ""Keanu gets angry and shoots bad guys"" but what makes it special? Directed by Chad Stahelski who's a stunt specialist boy does it show because the main selling point in the film are some real virtuoso action sequences, well made choreographies. Unlike today's action movies, it doesn't use quick-cuts or shaky cameras actually see what's going on.","

"Special-K88","30 July 2020","Though he no longer has a taste for wet work, retired assassin and ""Boogeyman"" John Wick has suffered a personal tragedy that's left a huge void in his life. When he and his dog (really the last meaningful thing he has left) fall victim to a scummy group of Russian mobsters, he emerges from his shell with vengeance on his mind. Slow and ambiguous at first, but reveals more as it goes along, and once it kicks into gear it rarely lets up with plenty of stylized, visceral action scenes, an impressive arsenal of weaponry, plus sly direction and editing that give it the feel of a violent music video at times. Preposterously fun to watch, it just doesn't have much of a story at its disposal, not to mention all the over-the-top bloodletting and mayhem eventually becomes redundant. Savvy, indestructible Reeves looks right at home, and delivers many of his lines with a sardonic wit. **Â½","

"ThomasDrufke","24 February 2015","John Wick is one of those few movies a year that seemed like it would be absolutely terrible, but when you finally sit down and watch it, turns out to be incredible. Not only is it one of the most fun films of the year, but it's so much different than the action films we have today. It doesn't try to be inventive or over-the-top, it just plays to it's strengths.I have never been a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. Even in The Matrix, which is a great film, his acting falls pretty flat to me. He hasn't showed me anything that can make him a true thespian on screen. But as John Wick, he's perfect. The role doesn't call for anything more than just being a likable bada**. Wick is a man dealing with the death of his wife and retirement of his past associations with assassins of sort. He finally feels like he get's closure with his wife and then it's all ripped away from him by the very gangsters he was once affiliated with. He goes on an absolute killing rampage. To say the body count adds up is an understatement. Wick goes to great lengths to find the people who took everything from him, but it's not exactly easy for him. Being someone who just came out of retirement means you may be a little rusty, well Wick is definitely that. That's one of the many things I appreciated about this film. It never seemed like he was blowing through these guys without danger. Sure he effortlessly kills plenty, but he also struggles with a few as well.Killing a cute little dog would tick off anyone, so I don't blame the character for being mad, but I'm not sure there needed to be this many deaths. There are plenty of innocent security guards who die at the hands of Wick. At times, it just felt like a little too much for a revenge film. But I really loved all of John's interactions with people from his past. They all seem to be as surprised that Wick is killing again, as we are that this film turned out to be good. I thought it was a nice touch that the police officer simply let the fact that there were a bunch of dead people in Wick's apartment, go. Alfie Allen plays the main villain, and it seemed as though his storyline is very similar to that of Game of Thrones. He's constantly under-appreciated and so he wants to prove himself, but ends up doing something terribly stupid. It was also nice to see Bridget Regan from Agent Carter briefly pop up.But besides the fact that the script was pretty weak and the body count was pretty high, the film is just awesome. The 'Drive' sounding music and score to go along with the breathtaking action sequences made for one helluva ride. Keanu Reeves should stick to these less demanding and fun action roles. Just don't try and do too much.+Stunts & action +Score/soundtrack +Reeves makes it believable+Villains aren't stupid -Body count -Weak script 8.4/10","

"ivo-cobra8","19 November 2015","John Wick (2014) is the best revenge flick from Keanu Reeves of 2014 from The Matrix (1999) to John Wick (2014) another action fast paced, Entertaining slick action packed film, which kind I have never seen before. It is a very fun, straightforward action movie with an 80's sensibility. It's nice to see Keanu doing these types of roles again. It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Keanu Reeves is a bad ass what a great action packed blood packed film. Movies should really learn from this on how to make a decent action film, especially with the crap we are getting today like escape plan bullet to the head and such. This film to me is the greatest action film to come out in this century. Keanu was phenomenal the action was so fast paced and exciting my jaw literally dropped as Keanu took out all the bad guys! I personally think this film is better then all Taken films combined. It was simply brilliant, it was made for 20 million dollars and I am glad it made 40 million in the US. I think this film deserved to make 100 million!Old school action with no shaky cam. Definitely the best stunt-man-turned-director-debut I've ever seen. The story is set about John Wick (Keanu Reeves) a retired assassin, who gets dragged back into his field when the Russian Mob put a hit out on him, but instead of killing John, they steal his classic Mustang and kill his newly acquired puppy. This sets John out to exact revenge on the whole mob in a no nonsense kind of way...multiple shots to the chest and one to the head for good measure type of justice. I've never seen a film where the gun play is this to the point and precise as this. I don't know what the body count is, but it's gotta be up there...way up there. Oh...and another thing...they actually reload the guns. Don't see that that often in films. It's got an all star cast of cameo/small roll characters, from Ian McShane, William Dafoe, and John Leguizamo, and I swear one of the bad guy henchman is that ""Mayhem"" Insurance guy. One of the Best Movie, that Keanu Reeves ever made. From start to finish. Non stop action, all scenes look very realistic. ( The best action movie of the year. ) I Love this movie so much I think the people behind this movie made a great astonish action movie. There are other things in the movie that I love so much. I even think John Wick is so much better than 47 Ronin (2013) that Keanu Reeves made. The most that I love in this movie is Adrianne Palicki as Ms. Perkins I think she did one of the best job portraying and playing the most memorable female assassin I have ever seen. Ms. Perkins made me realized and inspired me that there are a lot of women who choose occupation as a female assassin hired by the mob. There were a lot of female actresses who played an assassin but I have never see any women portrayed like that. Adrianne Palicki is a bad ass! She even played Lady Jaye in the G.I. Joe Team's covert operations a specialist in the movie G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013) one of my favorite movies. The fight sequence between John Wick and Viggo Tarasov is real and very realistic I did not see any CGI in it. This wouldn't be an action movie without some action. There's plenty of it, and it's perfectly done. The The stunts are completely insane in scale. There is a lot of gun play and powder even the guys reload guns. There are even Daniel Bernhardt from Bloodsport II and The Matrix Reloaded in it. And he was perfect in here and the fight scenes with Keanu Reeves were well done by him. This is the first time In the movie I see Willem Dafoe been the good guy. I haven't seen him in decades playing the good guy since Platoon (1986) my favorite Vietnam war movie! The last thing about the movie I want to say that John Wick was a dog lover and I love dogs. I love how he avenge the puppy's death by mobsters who killed him and than he saved another puppy from the animal shelter when he was wounded. He wasn't a superhero without any bruises on him he was wounded. Keanu Reeves did a wonderful job better than he did in Knock Knock (2015) I only hope they want screwed up the sequel and making much better action movie than the first was.When sadistic young thugs senselessly attack John Wick (Keanu Reeves)-a brilliantly lethal ex-assassin-they have no idea they've messed with the wrong guy. With New York City as his bullet-riddled playground, Wick embarks on a merciless rampage, hunting down his adversaries with the skill and ruthlessness that made him an underworld legend That is the main plot the rating I am giving this movie is a 10/10 because It deserves it.","

"Iam-Not-In-Danger-Iam-The-Danger","23 February 2020","It's hard to find anything bad to say about John Wick.

"AlsExGal","26 March 2023","... slaughtering a line from the superior ""Princess Bride"". It's a shame that Keanu Reeves is supposed to be one of the nicest guys to work
with in Hollywood, because this film is a mess. We should stop asking Hollywood to come up with original ideas, because when they do, this is the result. 101 minutes of cliched action that checks all of the boxes - retired hit-man coming out of retirement, a boy and his dog, the perfect wife who is conveniently dead, stolen cars, Russian mobsters, a spoiled son who doesn't have half the restraint and judgment of dad precisely because dad spoiled him, and lots of blood.We should stop criticizing the millennials so much, because all we've bequeathed to them is 100K of student debt each for four year degrees that don't get them jobs and films like this. Kudos to the effects team, because they did good work. They are the only reason this film gets even four stars.","

"Leofwine_draca","25 September 2015","JOHN WICK is a rare example of Hollywood getting things spot-on when it comes to creating the near-perfect action film. JOHN WICK is a relentless, pulse-pounding thriller that has plenty of similarity to the Liam Neeson classic TAKEN, albeit with a more simplistic (and also more emotionally intense) plot line. This is the kind of lean, pared-down film-making that's all about intensity and momentum. It sits well with classic international fare like POINT BLANK, SLEEPLESS NIGHT, MEA CULPA, THE MAN FROM NOWHERE, and THE RAID films.JOHN WICK isn't a perfect film; some of the dialogue is sloppily, some of the writing is too broad, and occasionally the music is intrusive. However, when it gets things right, as it frequently does, you can forgive all of these minor niggles and sit back and enjoy the ride. The clever decision was made to employ a martial arts expert as director, so the emphasis is on realistic, superbly choreographed action sequences, and they're hard-hitting and plentiful. The nightclub set-piece is the obvious highlight, but nearly all of the action here is spectacular.Keanu Reeves has been in lots of average or overrated films over the years but this stands as one of his very best, alongside SPEED. His dry, laconic turn is light years ahead of his other recent action flick, MAN OF TAI CHI. The supporting cast is basically unnecessary, but Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, and Alfie Allen all put in decent turns. In the end, though, JOHN WICK is all about the action, and quite simply it rocks. Bring on the sequel!","

"trublu215","20 October 2014","At first glance, John Wick sounds like a terrible film on paper but with the slickness of Keanu Reeves' performance as the titular character and the sheer brilliance in its action sequences, this marks the best action film of the year and one of the absolute best in the past decade. Following a brutal home invasion that leaves his beloved dog murdered by thugs from his past, John Wick vows revenge on the ones who have taken what he loves most. Like I said, on paper, this seems like a direct-to-DVD slopfest starring John Cena but as a film with Keanu Reeves as the lead, it marks the very welcomed return for Reeves to the genre. John Wick is insanely fun, violently brutal and an overall romp especially for those disappointed by The Expendables 3. John Wick is propelled by Tarantino-esque dialog mixed with the swagger of action stars from the 70s. Reeves literally emulates cool in this film and does it with such confidence, that we don't even doubt the character...even when he kills countless bad guys with extreme force in some utterly ridiculous and implausible situations. We don't doubt it for a minute. This is EXACTLY what you want out of an action film. It is briskly paced, brilliantly shot and meticulously choreographed and keeps you wanting more and more. The supporting cast filled with the likes of John Legiuzamo, Ian McShane, and Willen Dafoe also keeps this film very interesting. These guys don't play good guys, hell, John Wick by traditional standards would be a bad guy in any other film. Every character is more ruthless than the next and pushes John Wick to be more ruthless than they are, creating a very cool dynamic between the character and the plot regarding the idea of how far is too far? However, don't expect some revelation from John Wick regarding the morality of bad and evil. This film wants you entertained and does so with brute force, it never lets up, not even for a second. One scene in particular that will have your blood pumping is a showdown between thugs and Wick in a nightclub. This action sequence remains the best in the film and will have you grasping your theater seat because of the sheer intensity of it. Overall, John Wick is slick, violent fun that turns into a remarkable, surprising film that will catch you off guard. It is THAT good. I highly recommend this film to action buffs especially but I'm sure those who just like a good movie will love it as well.","

"utgard14","22 November 2014","Wow what a great surprise this was. I was told by a friend this was good but it's been awhile since I liked a Keanu movie so I was hesitant to try it. Retired hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) loses his wife to cancer. After her funeral he receives a puppy she left him. A few days later some thugs, led by the son of a Russian gangster John used to work for, break into John's house. They beat him up, take the keys to his beloved car, and kill the puppy. They did this not knowing who he was; they just wanted the car. Now John Wick is out for revenge and the Russian gangster is trying to save his son's life by sending killers after John.Keanu's great here. Glad to see him doing something watchable again. Willem Dafoe, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, and Lance Reddick lead a good supporting cast. Michael Nyqvist was made to play villains. Even Adrianne Palicki was good. Oh and hey the beat-up guy from the Allstate commercials is in this. The stuff with the hotel for assassins and the way they all know each other was pretty funny. About the only problem I had with it was the unrealistic scene where the bad guy finally gets the upper hand on the 'hero' and doesn't kill him. This sort of thing is common in movies but it's always unbelievable and reminds me of the old James Bond villains. This is easily the best action movie this year. Possibly the best straight action movie since the first Taken. English-speaking action movies, that is. It doesn't reinvent the genre or anything but it's entertaining.","

"Giacomo_De_Bello","23 January 2015","The only word that keeps coming back to mind when reviewing this movie is: exhilarating. The fun factor this amazing action film has is probably the highest of any movie this year. I could not stop myself from having a blast!First and foremost, being also the first thing you notice, ""John Wick"" is self-conscious of what it is and doesn't, for not even one second, take itself more seriously than it should. Fortunately this doesn't shut out the place for character connection and empathy. People often think the two of these things exclude themselves, but that is not what I think and this movie is proof of it. It has such a genuine sense of fun and humor, so much so that you are often laughing WITH (not AT) the movie at the preposterousness of everything and at the same time feeling genuine tension for the characters you're rooting for. I know it sounds ridiculous, but every single f***ing kill by John Wick feels exciting and liberating, it was incredible how much I was rooting for him. To this contributes some stunning, fast-and-furious level action scenes that benefit amazingly by the practicality involved. Hats off to the director and the special effects guys for staging such a flawless string of adrenaline-pumping scenes, in particular to the director for the highly energetically stylish direction that never feels as a gimmick or out of place, yet instead makes everything all the more enjoyable. Furthermore this is one of the few movies in which sound actually stood out and contributed in making the film a great success. Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role and brings to the screen so much charisma I could not help but root for the guy. He is surrounded by a great cast too that has very fun moments on their own. If all of this wasn't enough, ""John Wick"" has some great original ideas and plays with them in the best way possible.Despite having a blast in the theater and wanting to maybe see this movie again in a year or so, it isn't original, stylish or innovative enough to say: ""we've seen this plot before, but not quite done this way"". Yes it has its brilliance, but it is kind of cheesy, even if in a good way, and predictable. It doesn't rank up to a higher standard of action movie because of its straight-forwardness. It does have some stakes, but all in all there isn't really an overwhelming set piece or twist that makes it highly remarkable.Obviously, that is not what it's aiming for and because of that I could recommend this movie to anybody, just go and have the best action entertainment fun in the theater!","

"grantss","3 September 2015","Mediocre action movie.Shortly after his wife is murdered, a retired hit-man, John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves), is targeted by a Russian crime gang. After they steal his car and kill his dog, he goes on a revenge-fueled killing spree...Started fairly well - good build up and backstory. After a while, however, it loses any pretence of character-development, plot- development or intrigue and just becomes a simple action movie. This is unfortunate, as it had some potential in the crime-drama stakes. Even worse, it is action of the perfectly choreographed, first person shooter, high body count, explosions-for-the-sake-of- explosions variety. It got rather monotonous and predictable after a while.Ends up a tad boring, and disappointing. A bit more plot development, and less mindless action, and this could have been a good movie.","

"Howlin Wolf","10 February 2016","You could have written this on the back of a napkin... 'Guy's dog is murdered; guy goes mental, efficiently killing those responsible. The End'. There's no colour to the story, whatsoever; there are only garish colours in the nightclub scenes. If all you need to think something is cool is to see people getting beaten up or shot, then join the Army... Indiscriminately colouring random subtitles to look like comic book speech panels got old fast, too.This is going to make me sound all 'get off my lawn' (if I hadn't already!) but action movies used to be done so much better... These days, apparently all you need to make a popular action film is some fast editing and fight choreography, with the barest hint of a premise that absolutely no thought has gone into fleshing out - the end result being that the finished product has less depth than a puddle. I must be demanding, but for what I want out of even the most streamlined revenge flick, that just ain't good enough!","

"xiaoli7377","14 April 2023","I really don't understand the love that ""John Wick"" receives. It's just kind of a generic action thriller to me. No different than a ""Bourne"" or ""Taken"" movie. It gets a slight bump for me in a rating of 6 instead of 5 because I did think that the cinematography was really good and also the fight choreography was top notch. I can definitely see the influence of martial arts films on this.As for the story, it's basically not there. What's worse is the fact that the movie goes out of its way to constantly remind you that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as a character is someone who is incredibly lethal and dangerous and feared by criminals. In my opinion, this completely kills whatever dramatic weight the cheesy storyline that ""they killed my dog and stole my car"" plot has to begin with.I guess people liked it well enough because it's got three sequels and more to come. Personally I don't think it's any better than the average Netflix Original action movie. Huge skip in my opinion.","

"Palidan400","25 October 2014","Keanu Reeve is John Wick. He's a deadly and unstoppable hit-man, and it shows. ""John Wick"" is short and to the point, but so much fun. At 1 hour and 36 minutes running time, there is never a dull moment in what may be one of the best action films of the year. The film starts off quickly and never stops. It doesn't spend too much time on the backstory or development of Wick's life, yet it still succeeds so well in building up his character. Within the first 20 minutes, John Wick is called out of retirement when three robbers break into his home, steal his car, and kill his dog. Even before the action begins though, the film builds up so much suspense and gravity into who this ""John Wick"" is, resulting in a satisfying and exhilarating moment when his enemies realize he's back in the game. While the plot may be simple and straightforward, it works sufficiently in setting up a situation where the rest of the greatness can happen - stylized and awesome fight sequences where John Wick goes through dozens and dozens of kills. Seeing this in digital IMAX really helped boost the mood of the film; the intense sound design and visuals, the slick fighting and choreography on screen. There's this one scene in the film where John Wick assaults his way through a club, and all those elements combined make it an absolutely incredible sequence to witness. Besides John Wick and his fighting, the film does set up a very interesting world, thanks to all the other little details and characters it brings in. There is an organized system of those on the other side of the law, operating and exchanging ""gold coins"" while staying at bases such as ""The Continental"" hotel; this definitely allows room for sequels and spin-offs. Still, Keanu Reeves is the star of the show, and this is the best I have seen him in quite awhile. Again, the story is straightforward and audiences know what emotional journey to expect, but Keanu displays a good amount of range in his portrayal of Wick that is still nice to see. Just like his character states, I'm thinking he's back. ""John Wick"" is an awesome and enjoyable action flick that I would recommend. RATING: [8/10]","

"planktonrules","10 September 2019","When the story begins, John (Keanu Reeves) has just lost his wife. After her death, he's a bit lost but tries to rebuild his life. One day, he's getting gas and a young Russian-American punk notices Wick's classic car...and tries to buy it off him. But Wick isn't interested and declines. Soon, the punk arrives at Wick's home with some goons where they surprise him--beating him senseless, destroying his stuff, killing his dog and stealing his car! This is when you then learn that Wick is a super-assassin....and the punk chose the wrong guy to attack. The jerk's father is a big-time Russian mobster....and it's a contest to see who will win...the mobster and his gang or Wick on his own. Considering there are (so far) two MORE John Wick films, it pretty much seems certain who will win this battle.To say ""John WIck"" is a violent film is a gross undestatement. Once the dog dies, it's pretty much a bloodbath from then on...with Wick dispatching countless goons VERY realistically on his way to ultimate revenge. And, he doesn't just kill a few...he makes sure to kill them by double and triple-tapping his prey. Blood and mayhem make this a lousy film to show your kids, mother or Father O'Reilly when he comes over for a visit!So, aside from being a bloodbath, is it any good? Yes, it's an excellent all-action film...but....it IS hard to watch and is essentially a giant gore-fest. In many ways, it's like the Sonny Chiba 'Street Fighter' films....that violent and that dedicated to making sure all the victims are indeed dead! Mindless violence....albeit well choreographed violence. Not really my sort of film...perhaps it will be yours.","

"Horst_In_Translation","27 February 2016","There are actually quite a handful reasons why ""John Wick"" could have become a failure. The two directors have never made a film before and almost exclusively worked in the stunt department so far. The writer is not exactly experienced either. Lead actor Keanu Reeves usually scores more through boyish charm than through realistic portrayal of gritty badass characters. And the genre of crime action thrillers rarely delivers in terms of real significance. Still it became a very good film. The main reason for that is probably that it does not attempt to be anything of great cinematic value, does not try to teach groundbreaking stories on moral, loyalty or betrayal. Instead, Derek Kolstad's script goes for a gutsy revenge thriller that is not even hurt by its occasional predictability.I was very pleased with Reeves performance here. He is a man in his 50s now and I guess with age came a certain masculinity that works very well in this film here. Willem Dafoe is fun as always. Adrianne Palicki nicely plays a cold-blooded femme fatale. Lance Redick is a lot of fun with his professional take on Wick being a guest in his hotel. Alfie Allen is the real antagonist at times, but his character's age and and inexperience really cost him that perspective. Instead his character's father develops into the main enemy to John Wick, even if both apparently still have a lot of respect for the other and Nyqvist's character really only has to pay for his offspring's sins and Wick seems to understand that he wants to protect his son, even if he opposes this idea. People who complain that such a way of revenge may be way too much for a dead dog and stolen car have not understand a thing about the main character here. He is a testosterone-filled hit man, who has not acted rationally for years and will not do so either if somebody destroys the only link left between him and his beloved wife. That's why it is not an unrealistic film. I also liked that they did not choose to include a new love interest for the main character as it would have been really contradictory in terms of him mourning for his wife. They can do that in the sequel perhaps. Choosing the path of an assassin to avoid a 99% male cast was the right way to go.There are a couple moments that did not seem in a way that I'd have expected from Wick, usually these when he shows mercy for his greatest enemies, also the scene in the end. Yes he does respect Tarasov Sr. but after killing Dafoe's character is it really appropriate that he threw his gun away? I am not sure about that. I guess I'd have preferred an ending like the final boss battle from ""Taken"". And the dog scene at the end? Oh well, this is maybe one of the few areas when the film attempts to be something more than it should with the emotional significance that felt really only included for the sake of it. But there really isn't anything wrong with these 100 minutes. I enjoyed the watch a lot and this is even more impressive as action films can rarely stay memorable to me. Highly recommended, an extremely positive surprise how well it worked against all odds. I very much hope the second one will be equally strong.","

"IceSkateUpHill","22 October 2014","John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare.","

"Prismark10","18 April 2015","John Wick is an action film with video game type shooting scenes but a somewhat barmy plotting. Keanu Reeves makes it watchable despite the script.John Wick is newly widowed and his late wife gifted him a puppy which has been killed by the wayward son of a Russian mobster who has also stolen his car. However it is soon revealed that Wick is an ace hit-man and now he is back to get revenge and get his car back.This means various shooting and fight scenes. Wick is the man who the mob would call to kill the boogeyman. Yet we have scenes where minnows are easily dispensed with but the alpha male somehow survives.There is a female hit-woman out to get Wick and somehow he leaves her alone to cause further mischief. The Russian Mobster whose son Wick wants to kill is also let go by him when you would have thought it would had been better to shoot him fast.It is entertaining schlock, the plot is full of holes. Reeves acting is not stretched, he is required to be mean and moody, say a few words and do a lot of shooting.","

Reeves is covered in tats, of course, to show us toughness. Russian iconic tats no less - oops! 10.

Been done before ""cleaning crew"" just a call away to dispose of waste animal tissue (human of course). They always look the same in these movies. 12.

"Michael_Elliott","28 September 2015","John Wick (2014) *** (out of 4)After the death of his beloved wife, former hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) comes out of retirement when a Russian mobster's son breaks into his home, steals his car and kills his dog, which was a gift from his deceased wife. Soon the mobster (Michael Nyqvist) puts a contract out on Wick's life knowing that he's coming for revenge.JOHN WICK isn't a film that is going to be studied in film schools and it's certainly not going to be for those seeking ""high art"" or ""meaning"" in their movies. No, JOHN WICK is a terrific throwback to the crazy martial art flicks from the 70s. I couldn't help but watch this film and think of someone like Sunny Chiba in the STREET FIGHTER series. This film here is, of course, a lot more friendly to today's times as it contains non-stop bloody violence as it appears Wick just loves head shots.The film works so well for a couple of reasons with the first being that this character really fits Reeves style. By now we shouldn't expect too much for Reeves. Often times he sleepwalks through his roles with that laid back approach of his but that quiet nature actually works extremely well for this character. That certain coldness Reeves brings to the film works tremendously well as you can't help but root for him and cheer each time one of the bad guys fall. Nyqvist is also very good in his role as the Russian mobster and he too makes you believe his character. Willem Dafoe is also fun in his supporting role.The film manages to have some nice style and especially during the action sequences. There's no question that this here is one of the most violent action pictures in recent years with the action scenes containing a great amount of attention to detail but they're played out so well that it almost seems like you're watching a video game. Most of the gunshots, and there are hundreds, are in the bloody to extremely bloody range but the film is just so much fun that even those who don't normally like that type of stuff should be able to still have fun. JOHN WICK certainly isn't the work of Orson Welles but it's not trying to be. It's goal was to be a bad ass action film and it succeeds at that.","

Sorry, I meant offalÂor did I mean fecal? John Wick is another ""action"" movie obviously written by someone who built the script with the clichÃ©s of a couple dozen other lousy ""action"" movies. Not a bit original or cool on any level.A summary: A murdering psychopath falls in love, quits his job, and becomes a sweet and lovable charmer who likes dogs. Wife dies. OK, even if that isn't the stupidest introduction to a character you don't need 12 minutes to say this on screenâthe mistake of many hacks. For motivation you kill his dog and take his car? Really? Is that all you could think of? How long did it take the writer to come up with this gem? He kills 12 paid assassins who invade his home yet he gets his butt kicked by three punks? I guess he wasn't wearing his superman outfit. He kills a whole heck of a lot of people (I lost count after 17 or so). Most of them had nothing to do with killing his puppy or stealing his car.I kept waiting for something even remotely interesting to happen, something that wasn't a complete insult to the intelligence but it never came.","

"bbickley13-921-58664","23 October 2014","Keanu Reeves gives us the best b-action flick in the longest. Don't even know the last time I saw a movie like this on the big screen (feels like a Straight-to -Video type of film). Reeves plays John, a grieving widower who days after burying his ill wife gets carjacked by Russians who kill his dog( a gift from his dying wife). This was the event that spark what would be ninety mins of non stop mindless action. Ironically, Reeves does a great acting performance as a man focus on nothing but vengeance, and he gets it with the best gun play and violence the western cinema could possibly give us, but I expected noting less from the actor who directed The man of Tai Chi just a year ago. His love of Asian action films is reflected in this picture. Keanu is no Chow Young Fat, but he's an impressive runner up with this film.The movie had a similar quality to Denzel Washington's The Equalizer, but since Ted Theodore Logan does not have the acting chops of the great Denzil, the movie has to rely on choreographic style, something that Keanu has been good at since The Matrix. The action flowed like Neo was Fred AstaireIt was an action spectacular, filled with guns, fights, car chases, hot girls (like Adrianne Palicki as a hot girl with a Gun) . Don't wait for it to come on video, see it on the big screen.","

But he is not really a regular guy, he is a legendary baddie who criminals tell each other about as their bed time horror stories. Mafia is so scared of him, they call him the ""boogeyman"". Yet, armed burglars get inside his house and take him by surprise without any resistance from him.But wait, he is a ghost, a shadow-man ... yet when he doesn't have a gun, he might as well put on a t-shirt that says 'piÃ±ata' because even lamers are beating the crap out of him all the time.But wait, he is fast, he is ruthless and he is on a revenge mission ... yet rivals keep slipping out of his hands, he can't shoot anything unless the target somehow presents itself two feet from his pistol and he needs to be continually rescued by his only true friend who ""our hero"" doesn't give a damn about.I think what failed this movie, for me, was the script.

"Rob_Taylor","25 January 2015","I think part of the reason that I enjoyed this movie so much was that yesterday I watched Taken 3. That action movie was such a steaming pile of ineptitude that it makes John Wick look like Shakespeare in comparison.John Wick has its faults. Believability being the obvious one. But it believes in itself just enough to carry it off and not descend into farce, though it skirts that point very closely at times.One of the big draws for me here was the fight choreography. Plenty of thought went in to the extended action sequences and there was some imaginative use of the surroundings. Add to the fact that the shots are held long enough to let you see what is going on and the action is thoroughly enjoyable.There is plenty of violence and plenty of blood. Though not overly graphic or gratuitous, it doesn't shy away from it either. There are bodies, and blood, galore after every shoot out.It is difficult to describe the level of the action here, but the thing it most closely reminded me of was the ""gun kata"" motif from Equilibrium. If you liked that movie, then the general flow from one target to the next that Wick performs here will be immediately familiar.Story-wise, it is a simple revenge tale and the reasons for the warpath mentality of Wick are spelled out in the first twenty minutes or so. After that it is all action, pretty much.If the action had been done badly (a la the aforementioned Taken 3) or the fights hadn't been interesting, then this would have been a tedious bore-fest. But thankfully, all is well in that department and, as a result, the movie is enjoyable. Repeat viewing... maybe not so much. But I can think of many worse movies to sit through a second time.SUMMARY: Imaginative fight scenes elevate this above many similar action movies. Simple plot and larger than life characters. Well worth a watch and can probably be considered as Hollywood's answer to movies like The Raid.","

"potablepictureshow","19 December 2014","John Wick had been out awhile and at first I had little interest in seeing it as, for me, Keanu Reeves is generally whatever the opposite of a selling point is. However I kept hearing about how this was a bit of a throw back of an action movie and upon reading the connection between the director and Keanu, I thought I would have to put aside my preconceived notions and give this movie a shot.The movie had two ex-stunt men (one of which was Keanu Reeves' former stunt double) helming this film. This resulted in a lot of practical effects instead of heavy reliance on green screen. Also familiarity with Reeves likely left the directors with a base knowledge with how far they could push the star. This left the film's action scenes clean, realistic, to the point, and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.If I was going to break down the film's format, well it is of the ""semi-generic Punisher type, ex bad ass comes out of retirement to take on other bad asses"" type variety. It was 75% Japanese yakuza film, 20% Film Noir, and 5% video game. One stylistic element that jumped out at me right away was the choice to go with a narrow scope of field for focus. At first I thought maybe this was the projector in the theater but then I realized it was a choice made for the film. Normally this would annoy me slightly, and I suppose still did, as I am a big fan of depth of field, miseâenâscÃ¨nes set ups (Citizen Kane is one of my favorite films). I came to terms with the stylistic choice made for this film as it reminded me so much of Eastern influences, in this case it was reminiscent of Zen ink and brush compositions, where the sharpness lies in where the brush first touches down and the edges disappear into an almost mist like effect.While Keanu sold the action pieces well, he wasn't asked to do too much to stretch his stoic emotional range, which is just what the film required. He was pretty much perfect for this part if I had been for some reason been asked to recast this film, I would be hard pressed to find a better fit. This would have been right up Jason Statham's alley, however there is nothing more he could have added to it. There was something quietly instance about Reeves that made you feel that he was one not to be trifled with. Statham will always remind me of the character he played in Snatch, which was not at all overly menacing or intimidating. Rather, if I had my choice of an alternative, I would delve further into the Japanese gangster genre and extract Chow Yun-fat. Reeves was 49 in this film and still convincing as an ass kicker. Chow Yun-fat would have been ten years older, but that would have further added to the realism of a retired hit man that is unwillingly dragged back into the 'business'.Speaking of performances, this film was full of great character actors from the action genre and otherwise. One of these performances that I was not overly fond of was that of Alfie Allen. You probably know him as the dickless Theon Greyjoy. He worked in the part in that he was highly unlikable, however I was not sure which accent he was trying to commit to. This brings me to another flaw of the film. Many of the baddies simply did not measure up to be worthy of the John Wick challenge. A spoiled brat son of a crime boss nor the crime boss himself, an old man that the film gave no hint as to any physical prowess until the anticlimactic final battle gave any feeling that the fight would go any other direction except to a single minded John Wick killing stroke.I highly recommend this film if you are a fan of good action. This easily ranks as one of the pure action movies of 2014. Judged as just a movie, it is simple in story structure, but what it does it does very well.Blarv Score out of 10: 8.8","

Busting out his weaponry, Wick cuts a bloody swathe through countless bad guys en route to his target, always finishing with a shot to the head.The problem is that Wick is TOO much of a bad-ass. At no point did I feel like he was in real danger. Even after receiving a gash to the stomach the size of my fist and taking a severe beating, Wick makes Liam Neeson in Taken look like a pussy, escaping every situation with a flurry of fists and feet and umpteen carefully aimed rounds. It's as though he doesn't feel pain. It's hard to feel a genuine sense of excitement knowing that our hero (if a ruthless killer can be called a hero) is virtually indestructible.The action is well staged, and the level of violence is high enough to please many fans of the action genre, but I was left feeling more than a little empty. In fact, I was hoping that Wick would die at the end to finally be reunited with his wife (and his dog), but seeing as there is already a John Wick 2, the chances of that happening seemed quite low.5.5/10, rounded down for the novelty subtitles.

There are some great fight and shoot out scenes. Also great supporting cast like Willem Dafoe. Also I felt it just wasn't just a simply revenge film, it also shows the darkness within a man's soul.","

"skepticskeptical","17 January 2023","John Wick is a big disappointment, in part I suppose because I erroneously inferred that since it was a trilogy and involved a contract killer in trouble because of his past it would be along the lines of the Bourne trilogy. Definitely not. There is nothing intelligent in this film at all. It's essentially a long concatenation of brutal homicides, all supposedly justified because some evil Russian mobster killed John's puppy and stole his 1970 Mustang. Really?It's total overkill, literally and figuratively, and I cannot recommend this blood bath to anyone who does not spend hours a day playing push-button whack on whatever the latest mass-murder apps are being sponsored and promoted by the Pentagon these days (in the hopes of recruiting newbies for their drone program). Ugh.Given the gross disproportionality of the revenge killing fest here, I'd say that the one redeeming quality of John Wick is that it is a perfect metaphor for the entire War on Terror. A handful of criminals kill 3,000 innocent people in NYC, so let's go annihilate another million or so!","

"bob the moo","19 July 2015","When disease takes the wife of former contract killer John Wick, he can find no respite apart from a dog, gifted to him by his wife so that he will have something to focus his love on, to prevent him from slipping back into his former dark ways. A chance encounter with a Russian thug sees Wick's connection to this life severed, and he sets out for vengeance â a path that will take him up against the most powerful criminal gang in the city.Although it does start with a satisfyingly meaty emotional base, this film is one long action sequence of impossible acts and violence (with Wick seemingly looking to get extra XP from headshots). There is of course a limit to the appeal of this, but it is hard not to enjoy the mindless dark heart of this whole film, as it relentlessly drives forward with little thought of external logic, instead selling itself hard and fast throughout. Mostly this approach works; with minimal set-up it is not long before the violence begins in earnest, and it is solidly and stylishly done throughout, with slick design and satisfying set-pieces. The style does help because, with Wick being pretty much the Terminator, it is not always easy to feel any tension from peril, so instead we get the tension from the relentlessness and the speed of movement.Reeves is a good lead for this, since it does essentially require him to be emotionless and enigmatic â both of which he can pull off. He is surrounded by familiar faces, all of whom feel like maybe they were wasted by being in the film for only short times each, but all of which give the film a sense of quality â and everyone does produce something even if they only have one or two scenes (also fun for fans of The Wire to see the couple of faces showing up). All told, this is not the reinvention of action movies (as some have said) but it just a reminder of how they should be done well â enough emotional grit for us to care, and then good solid relentless action the rest of the way. It is nonsense, as so much of this genre is, but it is visceral, tough, dark, and really quite fun.","

"judywalker2","25 October 2014","Went to see John Wick cause I like Keanu and I had read the reviews and they were mostly positive, but I wasn't expecting much (even used my free movie tickets just to make sure I wouldn't be too disappointed if it sucked...well it almost sucked.) John Wick is your basic shoot em up that doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what makes it average. You know what you're getting from the start and you get a lot of it.There are some interesting characters (Marcus, Ms. Perkins) but for the most part you know what's going to happen to everyone, except maybe John Wick. You can sit through it but the stylized violence starts to repeat itself over and over and by the end you kind of lose interest.","

"jessegehrig","6 November 2014","I'm glad so many people like this movie because I figure SOMEBODY has got to like this movie. A little dull. Many skilled actors given sh*t to work with. Lots of action to forget the real world, but so sterile. Like, I've never seen gun violence so repercussion-free in my entire life, just fire a bullet into the air, no problem. I would say my major complaint is that the movie is not exciting- despite a lot of gore and gun violence ( which is good, it works for me ) it all so obviously happens in a slick fake world that there's no sense of danger for any character. If anyone dies it's glamorized and therefore less real, even the double taps to the face, stylized and melodramatic.","

"RichardvonLust","6 February 2015","So disgusting is this piece of filth that after one hour of perpetual killings, many of them graphic and sadistic, I simply had to leave the room and get some fresh air. I then immediately destroyed the DVD as a public service.The makers of this material should be arrested and imprisoned for corrupting society. And anyone who actually enjoys watching this ordure should immediately seek mental health advice. What plot there is can only be described as infantile and absurd. The film is simply a vehicle for promoting video games where the player searches out black hooded figures to exterminate them.We are expected to believe that a trained hit-man is woken at night by his puppy only to be hijacked by three (naturally) Russian mafia gangsters who beat him up, steal his treasured car and kill his dog.This same man then kills literally hundreds of security guards and other hit men who come at him one by one in a morbid procession of death. Night club revelers carry on regardless as security men are gunned down in their midst. Other security guards have their throats cut whilst seemingly standing there helplessly waiting for death.The concept that all these security men all have partners, mothers and families does not deter the hero. We are encouraged to think that any scale of revenge is permissible under all circumstances and to all proportions even though most of these murdered guards didn't actually do anything against him.The only merit of this film is that it represents perfectly the mentality of American culture; namely that if a cell of terrorists kill a few thousand Americans we are entitled to launch decades or war thereafter, bring tens of millions of innocent Muslim civilians into endless suffering and destroy the entire culture of the Middle East. Disproportionate revenge is the spirit of our age and John Wick is it's prophet.","

"Voeim","11 November 2014","Lesson learned: don't get on retired legendary hit-man John Wick's bad side. In the film of the same name, he goes back into action shooting up bad guys in a city where it seems that the cops have all simultaneously taken a vacation. Played by surprisingly youthful quinquagenarian Keanu Reeves, John Wick's style of shooting baddies is reminiscent of my days playing Whac-A-Mole, Duck Hunt, or any of those arcade games with the plastic guns. Wick is a vengeant superman, and this is the basis of the entire movie. Although he doesn't have a clear weakness that can be exploited like most heroes, Wick does get into enough trouble for the audience to be sincerely worried about him. If you're planning on seeing John Wick because you like movies with clever or meaningful story lines, then you're going to be disappointed. If you are looking for raw well- choreographed action and machismo, then look no further. House Greyjoy's Alfie Allen stands out as villainous Russian mafia brat Iosef Tarasov, and Michael Nyqvist (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) plays Viggo, his mob boss father. Adrianne Palicki, Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane and Dean Winters round out a strong supporting cast. Overall, I enjoyed John Wick as a pure action film. It doesn't have a storyline like The Matrix or Speed, but it was visually entertaining and the simplicity of the story allowed for appreciation of the action. This movie is manly and primitive, and proves that at the age of 50, Keanu Reeves can still mix it up as an action star.","

"idontknowiknowthatidontknow","31 October 2014","this movie is a huge joke, i've never seen anything so ridiculous in my life, it's even worse than runnning scared, keanu goes around and kills everyone like he's god incarnate. i mean in the professional, at least jean reno kills them in a very believable fashion, except when he shoots the cops from the ceiling of the room. i mean in this movie, nothing is believable, 30% of the people get head shotted while moving, that's just retarded, and nobody can headshot john wick, nobody can even shoot him in the arm, hands, leg, or feet. in the beginning, they send a commando squad to his house, like 10 people, they are getting killed one by one or two by two. i mean that's so retarded, even if these guys don't know what they are up against, the fact that ten of them are ordered to kill one guy would tell them they are up against someone good. i mean john just kills them one by one and headshots them like its nothing, i mean i can just fire blindly while he's fighting 2 of my buddies and get at least a shot on him, then i'll just empty the clip into him or go in and empty it into his head. there's a scene where the boss leaves 2 goons to take care of john wick who was hand cuffed, after seeing like 50 of their fellow goons headshoted, you figure they wouldn't leave much to chance. but no, they decide to suffocate him to death with a plastic baggie!!! they hardly even tortured him before doing it. and they exposed themselves to open windows. I would've just put 3 shots into his head. john's friend violated the code by helping him when he said he's gonna kill him and he was ratted out by a female assassin, but that earned her death, wtf? what did she do wrong? john's friend violated the code, why can't he be ratted out? I don't even know why the directed bother to give the bad guys a chance, why don't they just bring back neo and keanu can just off them all with his mind and the movie will be 5 seconds long. oh by the way, keanu can't act, i can grab any random people on the street, and chances are they'll be at least as good.","

It's 2015! You steal a guy's Classic Mustang and kill his 300,000+ LIKES on Facebook cute dog and watch out!....Hell hath no fury.!

Now it's crystal clear to me (AGAIN!) why I almost always refrain from revenge movies, or, for that matter, from the ""ACTION"" (Read: Violent) Genre in general! In one of these promo interviews, Keanu bragged that he killed 87 people in the course of this 93 minute (Till Credits) movieYou can do the Math Nearly 1 Body Bag per Minute! Gee, Keanu.... You had me at Number 4! O. K., So why the 6* Rating? Fair enough question! The Original Music, by Tyler Bates is nothing short of phenomenal! Look at his IMDb BIO! It is very impressive! From a technically crafted standpoint, WICK is truly excellent.I couldn't help but notice Eva Longoria receiving Number One Producer Credit here. My hat is off to her! She really knows what elements (Although they're not really MY elements!) are needed to forge both a real crowd-pleaser (75% of viewers rated this 7 Stars or more on IMDb!) and a solid box office success! WICK grossed over 43 Million, more than double its production cost! The cinematography was inspired, at times even artistic. The sound and sound mixing were at least a cut above your average Hollywood movie, which, to be honest, is really saying a lot! And other visual elements, such as sets, costumes and locations were all impressive.Absolutely must get one other thing off my chest. Despite the numerous fight scenes being extremely well choreographed and the endless gun- play having been blocked out meticulously... AND having sat down to watch with rather low expectations, WICK stretched Suspension of Belief well beyond the breaking point! Perhaps we should add Fantasy to Action, Thriller in the introductory genre description! Still, for those of you who are ACTION junkies, and I know there are a lot of you out there...It is a sure bet you will end up in that 75% I referred to a bit earlier!ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!","

Common man, you can't apologize I got to kill you and few thousand people around you cause I can't make a movie otherwise. And a way he kills? Man, I think every single video game maker would envy this director. Oh, I must admit that this movie fulfills the Hollywood mandatory condition where Russians are the bad guys. Has anyone noticed John's replies in this movie to most of the questions asked? He just repeats what he heard and sounds like Michael Armstrong in the 'Hot Fuzz'. All in all, I would recommend this movie if you are still with sega-mega drive but if you have ever played a game called counter-strike, then you might consider this movie boring. For all other viewers, just don't bother.","

"rmax304823","18 February 2017","I don't know how deeply I want to get into this. It's like stepping into a septic tank.So let's keep it short. Keanu Reeves is John Wick, wearing a cloak of ordinariness. Some Russian miscreants insult him at a gas station. That night, they break into his house, beat hell out of him, steal his car, and kill his dog. Well! The beating, yes; the car maybe; but the dog -- NO! His response is first-order change. He knows who dunnit because he just retired from a Special Ops group and he's skilled at martial arts, the use of deadly weapons, and has a talent with macramÃ©. None of these guys with a hidden past ever turns out to have been a busboy or a plumber. Similarly, the bad guys, as here, tend to be either Germans, Russians, or Arabs. We've never quite forgiven the Germans for World War II. Russia was balanced on the fence but now with Putin in charge, a dictator manquÃ©, they seem to be fair game again. I'm certain that in the crepuscular recesses of Hollywood board rooms they are DYING to drag Muslims into the narratives but it wouldn't be PC now, would it? The plot? Oh, the plot. John Wick shoulders his way through a crowded night club where the Russkies hang out and shoots everyone who looks disagreeable. His gun is quick. And he's thorough. One ugly adversary gets three bullets in the abdominal cavity and one in the center of the forehead. The wounded lying on the floor, he shoots and kills more or less in passing, not really paying much attention to them. That's just the first brutal encounter. Several others follow.In between massacres there are a few minutes of metaphysical discourse. ""John, what happened? You and I were colleagues."" ""Yes, but bonds fade with time."" ""Surely some symbolic interactionism persists."" ""Well -- YES AND NO."" ""At least as the systemic level!"" ""But not as individual traits."" ""But how can you KNOW that?"" ""My epistemological intuition."" (Bang, shoots interlocutor in center of forehead, dead center on the saggital suture.) By the end, Wick has either killed or brought about the death of dozens of men and women. Willem DaFoe dies horribly, for reasons never explained. It was just time for another bloody killing, I guess.Someone else suggested that this was a perfect action movie because it had nothing much other than perfect action. And if you don't like action movies, then stay away from them. I suppose I don't like most action movies -- the Stallones, the Schwarzeneggers, the van Damms, although I have a few on DVDs if they have something going for them besides blood -- if the narrative is properly jelled (""The Bourne Identity"") or if its so silly it's amusing (""The Terminator"") -- but ""John Wick"" takes itself seriously, as if it were structured in a way that distinguishes it from one of those skin flick with just enough of a thin plot to link the sexual episodes, the genre that begins with a happily married couple, then drags in a new lover for each, then the chauffeur, then the mule, and so on. Yet, the perceptive viewer is able to discern a moral message beneath the mayhem. Leave dogs alone.Why go on? John Wick, Chapter 2, is already in theaters.","

You never get to know how they found him, without knowing that john wicker is the guy you don't mess with. Even though he's car is apparently legendary,since what I assume is the best car chopper in town, won't touch it cause he knows who it belongs to.Another thing that struck me odd is, since when did the Russian mob do home invasion, just to steal a classic car to chop. To me that seem kind of petty for a organized crime syndicateJohn is suppose to be a professional hit man, the best of the best, cream of the crop. Yet he get he's ass kicked by a couple of thugs, wastes a lot of ammo by shooting people 5-6 times. He can't even take out 5-6 guys with a machine gun, and a 30 round clip. Not even when he has the element of surprise on he's side And the hand to hand combat is mostly bad. He got no style, no class, no elegance over it. I almost feel I'm watching American ninja all over again, were hand to hand fighting mostly consisted,of judo throws,wide punches and a few simple locking techniques.That's how bad this movie is. Every bad guy in the Russian mob seem to knows martial arts, cause 90% of them get into hand to hand fights with him. Most of the times he act like a rank amateur, instead of the super professional everyone is so scared of, that they start shaking in their pants whenever someone just mentioning he's name I really wish they'd give these types of roles to Jason Statham, he's better at playing these types of bad to he bone roles. Keanu reeves are better suited for something else, like playing stoner in Bill & Ted Best part of the entire movie, is when the scene when the head honcho of the Russian mob finds out over the phone,what he's son has done","

The story is silly, but the action is continuous as Wick is pursued throughout by men and women with bad intentions. He is a karate expert and is also skilled with a variety of knives and firearms which are quite useful to our hero. His background is sketchy and never really explained but one must just suspend belief and just take the ride as if on a roller coaster. Willem Defoe shows up to fill out a decent cast with Reaves carrying most of the load, as he is in almost every scene. It looks good and the New York locations are a good choice. A final 7.5/10.","

"MovieSonic","14 January 2015","Keanu Reeves always comes back with a little gem but this one is his best film in ages.It's a pure Kill Film, nothing more and nothing less. Keanu, as John Wick, has the only two things he has left in this world taken from him at a time when he has nothing left to live for and so, entirely understandably, he decides to take revenge. Keanu then proceeds to kill a significant amount of people.Here's what I liked about John Wick: clearly, whoever was in charge, really loves film and/or knows exactly how to improve upon every mediocre revenge film out there. The clichÃ©d bits seemed almost deliberate like a teacher showing his or her film students how to make a tired and overdone scene interesting and unique.I won't expand too much on this point other than to say that there is something engaging about every scene no matter how often it has been done before.What I really want to talk about is the fight scenes. This is the first time since the Bourne films that I feel someone has done something different and unique with fight choreography. All the fights seemed to be filmed in one take and without stunt doubles. There was one extended fight scene in particular in the middle which was stunning. I genuinely can't think of another actor who would have pulled off Keanu's character and choreography as well as he did.During the inevitable 'sit-down' with the bad guy and his men, they missed an opportunity to mirror a previous scene with a 'captured' female assassin, nevertheless; Keanu gets an opportunity to really let go and bring some much needed emotion to his character. I thought he could have gone further and this could have been more poignant but he delivered the scene really well.I think it's time to officially acknowledge a new genre of film: the kill film. I wouldn't label it as action because I expect action films to include action as part of the main story not the other way around. If you want to watch a good revenge/kill film, this is definitely the one.9/10","

"Robosharp","8 May 2019","The reason this review is like 5 years late is because my friend recently suggested we go see the the third instalment of the series, as the first two are so epic. I was like really?? He was like, yeah, oh my god, you gotta see John Wick! So now I have seen John Wick...Ok, the film starts off quite well. Immediately you sense a high standard in terms of production. Slick camera work, innovative editing, stunning lighting. Also the plot starts okay, we are introduced to John, seemingly normal decent guy, living a normal life with his puppy, mourning the loss of his recently deceased wife. Whilst minding his own business on a road trip, a few 'Russian' thugs like the look of his car and try to buy it off him. He rejects the offer, and drives away. Russian thugs really want this car, so they presumably follow him to his home. They then confront poor John in the middle of the night. Beat the crap out of him, and inexplicably kill his pet puppy in the process. Note that in this scene John comes across as quite vulnerable and practically defenceless against these thugs. If the thugs had of wanted to kill him, they really could have done. Instead they knock him out and leave with his car. John is left broken, and utterly distraught that his adored puppy has been taken from him. He wants revenge, and at this point we all want him to get revenge! But how is he going to go about? This man is no fighter, he can't physically take these thugs on, we've seen that all ready. He's gonna have to devise a plan, and he's gonna have to be brave. This could be good, my friend was right. WRONG..It turns out that John Wick is a super killer assassin. An invincible, unstoppable killing machine. They messed with the wrong guy! It also turns out that the rest of this film is steaming pile of cow pat...Queue John Wick killing hundreds and hundreds of practically innocent men in pursuit of his revenge. Okay I think amongst it all he does get the three original thugs, but you could miss it, seeing as he kills so many. And that is it, thats all this film is. Yes it's slick, hence not giving it 1 star, but it is shockingly immature.One last gripe, (equally as stupid as the fact that at the start of the film JW had his 'Steven Seagal' mode switched off), is how films think its only cool for 'heroes' to kill men. At one point in this dribble, a female assassin is going all out to kill John, as he has a two million $ bounty on his head. This woman, a professional assassin, and very dangerous will stop at nothing until John is dead, it is likely that she has killed many before. In a fight, John over powers her, and decides not to finish her off as she is a woman, despite the fact that she is only going to come back and try and kill him again. In contrast John kills many men that he really does not have too. Most not even posing a threat and had nothing to do with the killing of his puppy. In fact this female assassin goes on to kill one of John friends! But oh no, he can't kill a woman, thats not cool right??Wow. Not a big shock but I won't be watching the sequel or the third instalment. My friend and many others seem to lap up this garbage...","

"CinemaClown","28 November 2014","Absolutely remorseless, purely unadulterated & downright violent from start to finish, John Wick is possibly the most stylishly crafted, feverishly paced, seamlessly executed, intensely entertaining & immensely satisfying action flick to come out from Hollywood after a very long time which, apart from marking a welcome return to action for Keanu Reeves, also triumphs as one of the biggest cinematic surprises of the year, not to mention the coolest by far.Very refined in its visual presentation, taking a no-holds-barred approach with its content & providing heavy doses of pulse-pounding entertainment that many viewers will want to revisit again n again, John Wick is amongst the most impressive looking motion pictures of the year that takes its simple premise to an unexpected high, thanks to its kinetic direction, breathtaking action, neat cinematography, slick editing & a magnificent lead performance from Keanu Reeves.The film tells the story of its titular character who used to be an ultimate assassin but retired to take care of his dying wife. Losing her to cancer, he receives a posthumous gift from her in the form of a puppy, with whom he eventually connects. Things are set in motion when few Russian thugs invade his home to steal his car but also end up beating him & killing his dog. And so the ex-hit-man comes out of his retirement to unleash carnage on the gangsters who took everything away from him.Produced & directed by the first time filmmakers in Chad Stahelski & David Leitch, who until now had worked in the film industry as stunt coordinators, John Wick marks a stunning directional debut for both of them & is a spectacular start to their filmmaking careers. And Derek Kolstad's screenplay doesn't waste much time in setting up its premise or introducing its characters & gets right down on business from the start by telling just enough about Wick to get the plot moving.Technically, there is a lot to admire about John Wick as the film exhibits an otherworldly setting for a revenge thriller that makes minimal use of elements not relevant to the plot. Camera-work makes its mark in the close-combat sequences for it provides a clear view of the carnage & isn't ruined by excessive editing or shaky cam. Editing paces the story with vicious velocity while its cool soundtrack further enhances the experience by remaining in tone with the film's events.Coming to the performances, the film features a capable cast in Keanu Reeves, Willem Dafoe, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo & others, amongst which both Reeves & Dafoe end up impressing the most. With a character that's tailor-made for his talent & combined with his magnetic screen presence, Reeves delivers a swashbuckling performance & easily steals the show. Dafoe follows him close & despite his short role, manages to leave his mark.Yet the best thing about John Wick remains its action sequences that are stupendously carried out. With its debutant directors already well-versed in the field of action choreography & stunt work, the two manage to add new freshness to the combat sequences by nicely blending its gunplay with grounded martial arts to single-handedly elevate John Wick into the league of cinema's finest action entertainers to come out in recent years.On an overall scale, John Wick is a smart, sophisticated & incredibly well-polished cinema that nicely balances its high-octane action & finely enacted drama to succeed as a potent, kinetic & relentless entertainer. Helmed by two new directors who understand what great action is about, boasting a script that knows where to draw the line & spearheaded by Keanu Reeves' badass performance, John Wick is an instant classic that comes as a must for every action film fanatic out there.Welcome back, Mr. Reeves! Welcome back!","

"gladysmutie","21 January 2021","I love Keanu Reeves but this is not it. First and foremost, why not hire real Russians as actors? The movie has no depth literally. I watched it hoping for an arch. I just wasted 100+ minutes watching the main actor shoot people. You can watch it on mute and not miss a thing. I do not understand the high rating . I am utterly disappointed.","

"davidgee","18 April 2015","The theft of his car and the killing of his dog provide the motivation for an orgy of shootings and beatings. There's even a fight scene with a hit-woman, so that misogynists can get their jollies. Keanu Reeves obviously has bills - or alimony - to pay, which could explain his appearance in this schlock. Did Jason Statham and Nicholas Cage turn it down? Willem Dafoe, presumably also in need of a boost to his pension, has an inexplicable supporting role, and Ian McShane makes an appearance so brief it can't have paid much more than Extra work.The film is shot with pace and style, but the mayhem is endless, pointless, mindless. I normally avoid movies as bad as this; I should have avoided JOHN WICK.","

"blufrog49","24 October 2014","What is the point of this film? This is probably the most violent movie I have ever seen. Although other movies show more blood and gore, this is pretty much non-stop, with no real story. I wasn't surprised to read it is a video game because that's all it seems to be--shoot, shoot, shoot, with some punches and an occasional knife.Despite all the action/violence, I nearly fell asleep. I only stuck it out because I was hoping there would be a point to it. There wasn't.The site says I need to say more in order to have this review printed--seems silly, but OK--I DID NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE. IT IS POINTLESS. IT IS VIOLENT. IT IS COMPLETELY UNBELIEVABLE.My advice--if you are a kid who plays video games, you might like this movie.","

"billygoat1071","30 October 2014","If Death Wish is a revenge for a murdered wife or Taken a revenge for a kidnapped daughter, then John Wick takes vengeance over a death of a dog and a stolen car. At glance, people might find it quite silly, but the movie touches no irony within that plight, it simply just pictures a desperate man with nothing left to lose. However, it still displays a strange mix of tones: it introduces the story as some sort of a serious tragedy, and then we discover that this world turns out to be surrounded with a punchline of him having a normal reputation of killing people. The combination of gritty revenge thriller and tongue-in-cheek world of assassins is fine, but how the film connects them can be a little uneven, but once the guns appear, the fun is presented perfectly. It just lives up to what it is meant to be. There isn't anything big, neither mind blowing. John Wick is as straightforward as any fine revenge movie must be, plus an odd brightening flavor.Despite of setting up with a bleaker drama, John Wick actually builds a cooler mythology of its own. Sure, Wick basically has a legend of being the most lethal hit-man his enemies will ever face, that also defines to the characters who personally know him. Example is a cop who just found him wacked a few bad guys and still lets him go, because he is ""John Wick!"" It's his thing! Everyone else in this world also has their own backstories, there must be some richer stories behind them, but in the end, that's just the movie giving this typical revenge flick some personality, and it indeed helps, keeping the experience from being stale.The plot never compromises with any twists, it just slow burns to the point until the anti-hero finds his target. This slow burn can be a little dragging, it introduces too much exposition that most of it turn out not going to matter in the end, they are probably designed to build more tension. The movie is better when it's finally on the action. The film biggest credit here is the camera work. There is not a shot that misses some sort of violence. Every gunshot and fist has to present the consequence on screen which manifests his boiling anger. And even without the fights, there are still some slick, stunning sights to see around. Predictably, Keanu Reeves must be the only one who is taking this silliness seriously, which makes sense since his character is the only one who is in real pain in this fancy mission. That vast seriousness just perfectly suits at depicting Wick's desperation and madness, also his fighting hits even harder compared to those days in The Matrix. But the show stealer here is Michael Nyqvist who brings the joy in his nutty yet menacing performance as the villain.John Wick sometimes feels like there is a larger world meant to be explored or a deeper theme to be considered, but the film has priorities of following the classic roots of the revenge genre. It's not so bad since it makes for an easy viewing through its fine looking action scenes, but it also leaves a lot of potential hanging. But if you are only here for Keanu Reeves back in action, then this movie totally sells, in fact that is what we are all here for anyway. Still, we might have thought of some possibilities if the movie was more ambitious, but then most of us won't think it matters. It's already stunningly crafted, if not original or special. Just sit right in for a straightforward show of violent gunfights.","

"zardoz-13","4 November 2014","Never kill an action hero's dog! All hell breaks loose in the sadomasochistic, R-rated, revenge-thriller ""John Wick"" because the malevolent villains not only steal our hero's 'to die for' vintage 1969 Mustang, but they also murder his dog. Had these unsavory felons had contented themselves with the Mustang, they might have survived the ordeal. Watching the ferociously violent ""John Wick"" rekindled memories of director Antoine Fuqua's conspiracy theory thriller ""Shooter"" (2007) where the villains made the fatal mistake of killing Mark Wahlberg's dog. Bob Lee Swagger, the Wahlberg hero in ""Shooter,"" cleaned everybody's clock after he buried his dog. Basically, Keanu Reeves does the same thing to the heartless hooligans who slew his adorable puppy. ""John Wick"" pits our resilient hero against the malignant Russian mafia infesting New York City like a cancer; much like Denzel Washington did in ""The Equalizer."" Most of the ruffians who died in ""The Equalizer"" perished off-screen, and we were shown their twisted bodies sprawled like blood-stained laundry after the fact. Unlike Denzel's sympathetic, good-guy vigilante, Keanu Reeves is cast as a retired Russian hit-man who exterminates everybody in sight without a qualm. Along the way, our hero has his nose bloodied, his ribs kicked in, and stitches sewn up in his stomach. ""Matrix"" stuntman turned film director Chad Stahelski has taken scenarist Derek Kolstad's formulaic, B-movie screenplay and fashioned it into a cynical, rapid-fire, actioneer with the double-digit body count of Asian director John Woo's classic ""Hard Boiled."" If you haven't heard of John Woo, then ""John Wick"" is comparable to the two Gareth Evans' hard-knuckled, non-stop thrillers ""The Raid"" (2012) and ""The Raid 2"" (2014). Kolstad's larger-than-life script recalls venerable genre classics like the Lee Marvin shoot'em up ""Point Blank"" (1967) and the hard-as-nails Mel Gibson movie ""Payback"" (1999). A lone gunman in both ""Point Blank"" and ""Payback"" wipes out the mob in a metropolitan city. If you cannot tolerate seeing dozens of gunmen getting riddled with bullets, you should skip ""John Wick."" After a string of forgettable, half-baked thrillers and fantasies, including ""The Day The Earth Stood Still,"" ""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee,"" ""Man of Tai Chi,"" and ""47 Ronin,"" Reeves appears to have recovered his poise with this high body count, pistol opera.The hard-bitten Keanu Reeves title character hung up his hardware after he fell in love with Helen (Bridget Moynahan of ""Battle Los Angeles""), an angel in disguise who saved him from a life of crime. Unfortunately, she succumbed to a fatal illness and died at the hospital with John at her bedside. Before she passed away, Helen has the presence of mind to write a farewell card to her husband and attach it to a pet taxi containing a cute, floppy-eared puppy. Our dry-eyed hero weeps at the memory of his long, lost wife and prepares a place at the foot of his bed for Daisy. One day while Wick is fueling up his Mustang with gasoline, a carload of rude Russians cruise in to the convenience store. One of the Russians, Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen of ""Atonement""), admires Wick's ride and asks him how much he would sell it for. ""It's not for sale,"" Wick replies without a second thought. When Iosef mutters in Russian that everything has a price, Wick rebuts him in Russian that his Mustang is not for sale. Later that evening, after he has gone to bed alone, Wick awakes as Daisy starts barking and scampers off the bed and downstairs. No sooner has Wick followed Daisy to investigate the disturbance in his sleek, ultra-modern house than he is knocked down and violently beaten up. The three thieves confiscate his car keys, and Iosef kills poor Daisy. Later, Iosef and his accomplices careen into an automobile chop shop run by Aureilo (John Leguizamo of ""Carlito's Way"") for new papers and a VIN number. Areola refuses to accommodate them. He goes so far as to punch Iosef in the face. Iosef's father Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist of ""London Voodoo"") offers his son a drink and then slams his fist into Iosef's stomach so his son vomits on the floor. Viggo tells Isoef that Isoef has made a fatal mistake. Viggo explains that John Wick consolidated Viggo's empire before Wick retired. Viggo witnessed Wick kill three ruffians in a bar with nothing but a pencil. Unfortunately, we don't see Wick repeat this rather astonishing act. Nevertheless, Wick is a crack shot with any kind of gun and drives a car like a racer. Immediately, Viggo hires the next best hit-man alive, Marcus (William Dafoe of ""The Boondock Saints""), but sets up the contract on a first-come/first-sell basis for anybody. Like I said earlier, all Hell breaks loose, and everybody relies on the same clean-up crew to mop up the blood, bodies, and broken glass.Naturally, ""John Wick"" is barely believable. This is a slam-bang, shoot'em up done with a straight face and a cast of familiar faces dodging bullets in New York City. Everybody wears body armor and packs extra pistols. When John Wick shoots an adversary, he puts at least three slugs in each adversary with a coup de grace to the head. Sure, blood splashes from these wounds, but it isn't gratuitous like ""Saving Private Ryan."" Stahelski stages everything as if he were directing a Spaghetti western. Bodies spin, topple, and stagger. Here and there, Stahelski slips in a surprise or two because John Wick may be indestructible, but the Russian mobsters aren't totally asinine. ""John Wick"" isn't strictly about guys with guns. Actress Adrianne Palicki shows that gals can be just as lethal with firearms, too. British tough guy Ian McShane of ""Deadwood"" fame makes a memorable appearance as the owner of an off-limits nightclub motel who doesn't cater to killers killing killers on his premises. Although it isn't wholly original and is often predictable, ""John Wick"" qualifies as a sizzling saga with slimy villains and lots of kinetic, bullet-piercing action.","

As John Wick, the revenge-driven protagonist, Reeves hits the right target & reaffirms his status as an action star. Willem Dafoe is in terrific form, yet again. Ian McShane has a brief role, but leaves a solid mark. John Leguizamo shines. Michael Nyqvist as the antagonist, is fabulously evil.On the whole, Love Action Films? Watch 'John Wick'.

"lewilewis1997","14 January 2015","THIS FILM BOMBED SO BAD THEY'VE RE-RELEASED IT IN UK CINEMAS - DON'T GO!!!I went to the flicks to see this based on several reviews, mostly from IMDb. I love a good action thriller, the Bourne franchise blew me away and set the action thriller bar far higher as a result of its originality and success. HOWEVER...............Mr.Reeves was his usual unemotional, wooden, B-Lister self; the plot line was the basic 'revenge' story used a thousand times before without one jot of its own originality. I figure the producers want the (obviously planned for) sequel to better 'part 1', it won't be hard to do.Thick gangster, even stupider gangster, muscle gangster, gangster gangster and top gangster's psycho son make an appearance - just to keep the clichÃ©s coming. Many, many guns, many, many choreographed 'fight' scenes, but not much else.The lavish budget looked to have been plowed into amazing sets, rare muscle cars and designer wear for a myriad of extras (and probably some freebies for most of the critics, or how else did it get 'good' reviews?!). I stayed as long as i could hoping things would improve, they didn't; so 1 hour 10 minutes in I had to admit it was totally pants and left the cinema feeling ripped off and cursing every teen reviewer on here. I still don't know how it ended, and I don't care. But let me guess........ Against all adversity and many lethal obstacles John Wick finally gets his revenge at great personal cost, many bloody injuries and sacrifice, but at least he avenges his dog, probably with an almost funny one liner as the cherry on top. Am I right? Go and watch anything but this, even a mindless frat movie would be more intelligent and entertaining.TO THE MANY 'POSITIVE' REVIEWS ON HERE - WHEN YOU GROW UP MAYBE YOU WILL LEARN WHAT A GOOD FILM LOOKS LIKE?","

Unfortunately, this is one of the worst action movie among the ones I've seen!
Ordinary, full of cliche, lack of aesthetic and far from a solid story.
Do we have to suppose that being heartbroken and agonised (film tells sources of these emotional accumulation in 2-3 minutes) is an enough motivation to kill numbers of men? Does this motivation provide any profoundness to the movie? Is the director aware of the wizards like Tarantino, Besson, Scott etc?","

"ACollegeStudent","27 March 2023","Rating: 6.9Honestly, mediocre the action scenes were mostly good as they didn't have many cuts making them hard to follow, but the plot was predictable, the dialogue was generic action-flick dialogue, the music was brazen and cheesy in places, and the side characters weren't interesting Viggo the generic mobster who somehow didn't educate his son of the most dangerous man on the planet, Iosef a one-dimensional idiot needed as the catalyst for the conflict, Perkins also an idiot who walked right into her death at the continental knowing the consequences for breaking their rules etc.. Everyone else is either no-name goons or acquaintances of wick whom them being acquaintances of Wick is their only defining character trait. The story isn't about them but when you have an MC as dry and brooding as John you need someone to add some engagement value when John isn't fighting. The ending was nicely symbolic as john adopted a black guard dog showing he's moving forward from his wife's death but not attempting to bury his assassin's past but overall nothing in here warrants a sequel.","

"paulclaassen","10 June 2018","Critics and audiences around the world raved about 'John Wick'. What did I think? Uhm, still deciding. The film starts off with so many Hollywood cliches: the flashbacks to tell the back story, the rainy weather funeral with black umbrellas... Yes, Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast as John Wick. Yes, the action scenes are non-stop and brutal. Yes, the stunts were awesome. Yet, I still didn't enjoy the film. The film has a bodycount of note, you'd think it's a John Woo film! This is just way too violent for my liking with way too much unnecessary killings. Sure, Wick was out for revenge, but this is a very extreme vengeance film. I realize he did not go on a killing spree because they took his car and dog from him. The reason for his revenge goes much deeper than that, I get it, but still...Does this justify Wick killing over a hundred people? Although it is never mentioned in the film, it is obvious Wick is an ex-hitman and therefore probably does not have a conscience, but I can't help but feel this character goes completely beyond revenge. On the contrary, it becomes cold-blooded murder instead. Also, I understand Wick was one of the best hitman, but is it possible that he can outwit and dodge so many hitmen in the club? If this is the case, this organisation seriously need new hitmen!The film also features the ""no gun"" ending fight scene. Seriously, Hollywood, this is SO cliched and annoying! If Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), the crime boss, wanted John dead, why didn't he just shoot him? Why would a man in his sixties opt for a fist fight with someone as highly trained as John Wick, instead of just shooting him? This scene was not credible at all. Is it a film I'd watch again? Nope. (I must mention I absolutely loved the soundtrack.)","

This movie is not better than the average low budget, low quality Steven Seagull run of the mill movie. Inverosimil script, bad direction, bad actors, bad soundtrack, bad everything.
Keanu looks like he's playing a video game from beginning to end shooting right left and centre killing dozens of guys. Even the soundtrack is more fitting of a video game.
So I'm very disappointed, I was expecting much better after all the publicity and promotion. The cinematic value of this movie is next to zero.","

"wellthatswhatithinkanyway","16 March 2016","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning After the tragic death of his wife, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is given a dog as a parting gift from her, in order that he won't return to his former life of violence and mayhem. However, a run in with gangster's son Iosef (Alfie Allen) results in his home being invaded, and his pet being brutally murdered. This sets the fire raging in John's heart again, and before long, he returns to the streets to enact brutal revenge. However, Iosef's father is Viggo (Michael Nvquist), a Russian mob boss and his former employer.It's remarkable that, while far better actors have descended into a DVD bargain bin hellhole from which there seems no return, Keanu Reeves would still appear to have the star power to headline a Hollywood action film. He could be comfortably settled into that world quite nicely now, but here he is in this fairly well received action film. Quite hard to fathom why, really, when what we have is a fairly standard, join the dots piece of work, with unexciting action scenes that are too sped up and hyper kinetic to make any impact.While Reeves broods, and does the action hero typeset that he's so suited to, singer Lily Allen's brother Alfie appears as the despicable young villain, and the likes of Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo are drafted in as support. Its appeal seemingly lies in its simplicity, with what seems to be a deliberately straightforward, uncomplicated plot that takes you from A to B pretty easily. It does this pretty competently, but rather than be an admirably simple bit of fun, it's just a piecemeal, ineffective affair that washes over you like rain. **","

I don't think he is a bad actor, but his acting coach must surely have been the most incompetent in Hollywood history. He plays exactly the same character in a tender love story, as he plays in an 'action' thriller.Now he does this. An 'action' thriller designed purely for 14 year old boys with pictures of cars on their bedroom walls. It plays out with the stock grunty voices (because tough men have no tonsils)... and the villains are Russian... with Russian accents only found in Los Angeles.Then they kill the cute puppy. Keanu gets so miffed that he opens up his secret basement full of big guns and even bigger bullets. At this point... I gave up. I don't mind mindless fun, but I do object if I have to be the mindless participant.Keanu... do The Lake House Part 2... That was a half decent film. This... is juvenile garbage that juveniles don't deserve.Staggeringly formulaic, dismally predictable... and hilariously bad.","

I have to hand it to Keanu Reeves, though. For a guy who can't act in anything but a ""Bill and Ted"" movie, he's managed to make a decent living at it--some might even call it a ""career."" Amazing, because he's got to be one of the worst actors in the industry. Gary Grubbs, Everett McGill, and Keanu Reeves should do a film together. They could call it ""The Tin Men."" Other than Keanu's absolutely awful attempt at acting, the plot of this thing was laughable and the action sequences perhaps the choppiest thing I've seen on film since that Korean guy did the whole Gangham Style dance craze foolishness.

I probably had too high expectations, but the ""one-man-army/revenge"" concept has been done so many times before and done much better than this. The movie is rather boring - no real story here, and the characters aren't very interesting. The action scenes are mediocre and too much ""over the top"". The whole thing just gets really tedious after a while.The revenge concept needs to generate sympathy from the viewer, and we need to be interested in seeing the revenge getting carried out. This movie didn't manage to do any of that for me. I was surprised to read quite a bit of positive reviews of John Wick, and a metascore of 68 was also surprising. I'm normally in line with at least the IMDb score, but this time I can't find much in this movie that warrants more than a 4.0 rating.","

John Wick is very skillful , he managed to do impossible task, he can head shot everyone in the dark, but then he somehow manages to miss five times in a row at Iosef, incredible...John Wick is a ruthless killer, he wants to kill everyone, but when he encounters a female assassin, he decides to leave her alive. How touching.Viggo, mafia boss, hires most professional killers and puts 4 million bounty on John's head, but when he captures him, he decides to play a little bit and leaves him with only two imbecile guards, seriously? If you have more than a couple of brain cells, do yourself a favor and do not waste time and money on this garbage.","

"Red_Identity","13 January 2015","Ultimately, doesn't really amount to much in terms of substance. But the film clearly knows that, the filmmakers are very aware and they play it up to its maximum potential. Reeves actually makes for a solid action lead here, and the film does good with its incredible style by allowing a lot of quiet intensity to play out before the big action scenes. The film is incredibly stylized, so I could see that being a problem for many, but to me, completely reminiscent of Drive and everything that art-house action can do. I don't know how the film will hold up in the future, but as of now, I'm in sort of love. I highly recommend this, aesthetically very pleasing and also a lot of fun.","

"nogodnomasters","12 May 2019","John Wick (Keanu Reeves) the other super crime fighter from New Jersey, the one without a mop, retired from being a hitman for the Russian mafia. When the undisciplined son (Alfie Allen) of the mafia steals John Wick's car and kills his puppy, this sets off Wick for some over-the-top revenge that includes the entire Russian mafia in New Jersey.The film is action driven with moments of humor and dark humor, some unintentional. For instance, the mere mention of Wick's name makes men tremble, reminding me of the South Park Keanu Reeves running gag. Personally I would have loved it if they just left the name at Keanu Reeves. Yes, he once killed three men at a bar with a pencil, again a running story/gag in hitman films. John Wick is not the boogie man but ""the man you hire to kill the boogie man.""There were some ""safe zones"" in New Jersey, places where mafia people can't kill each other. This was a bit weird and awkward as was the soundtrack during the first major fight which was like listening to someone trying to play metal grindhouse with drums which stutter start and stop. It worked better in subsequent scenes, but not the first one. It was also odd that someone could get the drop on John which started this whole thing off, and that John would sleep with his curtains open, after all he did kill three men with a pencil. Imagine if he had a ballpoint.For those who like over-the-top action films with the improbable and impossible, plus some humor, this is it.F-bomb. No sex or nudity.","

"anaconda-40658","24 November 2015","John Wick (2014): Dir: Chad Stahelski / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Willem Dafoe, Adrienne Palicki: Recycled action farce with that ever familiar scenario where one guy kills dozens of hit men and its tone is one of complete dismay for any message. Keanu Reeves stars as John Wick, former hit-man who left that life to settle down with his wife. She is killed during flashbacks. After her funeral a dog is delivered and a card from her lays claim to this being her final gift to him so that he can move on. Problem is that someone takes interest in his car. When he refuses to sell it, they respond by beating him up in the night, killing his dog, and stealing the car. If this nimwitted setup wasn't enough, viewers can predict what happens next. Wick makes a quick recovery and goes on a killing spree that would be the envy of any slasher film villain. Like The Equalizer, we have a hero who can seemingly take on an army, and like that film, these thugs are just targets for violent carnage for the sake of mindless entertainment. Reeves actually fares well as this former hit-man whose past will not allow him to embrace his future. Michael Nyqvist plays the villain, Wick's former boss and whose son committed the sinful act against Wick. Alfie Allen plays Nyqvist's son whose pride overrides intelligence and he soon finds himself fleeing through a nightclub with Wick in pursuit. Willem Dafoe plays a hit-man hired to kill Wick but he actually aids him instead. Adrienne Palicki plays a hitwoman who targets Wick in a hotel room. Directed with skill by Chad Stahelski with a screenplay that sets the tone for retching carnage over meaning. Score: 5 / 10","

"cadillac20","23 October 2014","John Wick was a pleasant surprise when it showed up in trailer form a little over a month ago. Coming out of nowhere, this indie action pic with a fresh director and great cast wowed a lot of people, and for good reason. It boasted the promise of excellent action, with Keanu Reeves returning to form as the badass lead. And a badass he is. John Wick is the kind of action film we don't get these days, and the director clearly knows what he is doing in delivering a truly excellent action film.First things first, John Wick isn't going to win any big awards. It doesn't really do anything new, even in terms of innovative action. None of the characters are fresh and the story isn't really that original. But none of that matters because it's so stylishly crafted, the acting, direction, and writing so smooth, and the world so well designed, that any action junkie can get behind this slick, heavily stylized, action packed romp. After a flashforward, the film details the current state of John Wick's life. His wife has passed away and he is obviously taking it very hard. After her death, he receives one last gift from his wife, a puppy to help him keep from being alone. But it isn't long before he loses both his prized car and his last precious gift from his wife. With this taken from him, we find Wick falling back into his old life of assassination and violence. See, John Wick was once part of a world of criminals, assassins, and killers. And, according to the primary antagonist, he was the one who was hired to kill the boogey man.And it is here where the film picks up. Where those first quiet moments in the film were somewhat slow and dreary, from the moment John Wick becomes the victim of crime to the very end of the film, it's almost non-stop action. The biggest challenge the film had was setting up Keanu to meet the legend he is described in as the film. But I can completely reassure you that Keanu is a complete badass here. While he still is not the fine, domineering actor you might find in other recently christened killers like Liam Neeson, he has the skills necessary to prove that you don't mess with John Wick. Whether it's playing up the role of a superman, capable of tackling a younger, equally talented killer while suffering a severe injury, or taking on a dozen men, all armed, in a matter of a few minutes, Keanu doesn't need to rage, pull out a booming voice, or make speeches filled with slightly ambiguous threats. All he has to do is flip you over his back and put two in your head with ease. If you don't believe Keanu is the feared killer he's trumped up to be at first, you will by the end of the film.What helps pull this off are the thankful decisions of first time directors David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. As stuntmen, they clearly know their action. They eschew the typical, modern style of action of close ups and quick cuts in favor of nice, long medium and wide shots minus the quick cutting. This offers us practical action scenes and puts trust in the actors skills. Keanu has certainly proved himself capable physically, with his time spent in the Matrix and more recently Man of Tai Chi and Ronin 47. The directors allow him to use his skills to deliver action that never feels fake or trumped up. It's authentic and completely badass. Supporting him are an array of actors, including Wilem Defoe as an old friend in the business, Adrienne Palicki as a fellow assassin given an assignment to take John out, and Michael Nyquist and Alfie Allen as father and son gangsters, the latter of which who is the perpetrator of the crimes against Wick. Nyquist is especially good, a villain that isn't completely evil, and even a bit likable, who we're immediately introduced to as someone who doesn't necessarily want to do what he knows he has to do. He's entertaining in the role and makes for a criminal that, under different circumstances, might have actually been an ally to Wick. Action films of the guns and martial arts variety have kind of gone by the wayside in the past few years, with few theatrical releases and most being VOD. But John Wick is a welcome addition to a legacy of great cinema action. For any action junkie, John Wick is an absolute must and I can only hope that this isn't the last time we'll see this Wick.","

"travola-35109","2 September 2023","The first John Wick is an absolute masterpiece of action cinema. With 3 additional films already released most people who didn't check this out when it was first released don't understand how explosive this film was when it showed up in theaters. There's been decades of action films but this one was just different. Every action set piece was executed perfectly and while it clearly a work of fiction and essentially a grounded superhero film in style, it's realistic in its approach to the film genre. Reeves took himself to another level in preparation for all these films but this is the one that set the bar for not just the remaining films in the series but for action films in general. The gun play is top notch, the hand to hand combat is fluid yet there is a struggle between combatants which gives it the realistic feel.I recommend the entire film series and each one just ups the ante as they go on but the first one is the most important action film since the 1980s.","

"goods116","2 November 2014","This movie was watchable, but seriously an 8? Again, I find these ratings are given out of context, meaning that it's not being compared to other movies. The plot is basically a hit man is wronged and kills everyone in the mob gang who wronged him. That's basically it. How many times can we watch Keanu Reeves kill someone with a gun? The idea that 40 gunmen can't stop him is also ridiculous. Why didn't they post two snipers in that club who would shoot him as soon as he entered. Really, no one other human, no matter how many, can hit this man with a gun? It all gets super repetitive and ridiculous. By the end it was just boring. Yes, good acting, good filming, etc. it get's all that, and the ""world"" they created was OK, the only reason it gets a 6 not a 4 or 5. Really, skip this one.","

Everyone is screaming and running around while the guns are absolutely blazing.When a killer's wife dies, Keanu Reeves, the grief stricken widower, is soon robbed of his car and his beloved dog put to death by the son of a fellow gangster. As a result, all hell breaks loose and nothing is spared.This is nothing more than an overly violent film showing what killers do each other when the other is affected.","

"ZChrisJ1995","10 November 2014","After a recent barrage of rather forgettable action films, it's refreshing to see that 'John Wick' provides excellently-choreographed, energized fight sequences as well as elaborate chase scenes, in addition to a likable protagonist who you can easily root for. In essence a revenge flick, 'John Wick' details the titular ex-hit-man's mission to hunt down the people that stole his car and killed his dog, the latter being a final gift from his deceased wife. As it turns out, the people he's pursuing are related to his former employer. I'm not the hugest fan of Keanu Reeves as an actor, but he nails the role of John. It's largely a physical performance, with John being a seemingly introverted, rarely talkative individual. This sympathetic, almost vulnerable side is juxtapositioned effortlessly with the brutal, merciless part of him that reawakens on his quest for vengeance. A great return to form for someone who hasn't really had a decent role since 'The Matrix Trilogy' or 'A Scanner Darkly'. A lot of the other cast members, such as Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo, as well as a surprisingly large amount of people who have worked on HBO programs, receive very limited screen time considering their impressive portfolios. Nevertheless, they are all still able to maintain a hefty screen presence. Being directed by a stunt choreographer, it doesn't really come as a surprise that 'John Wick' has some ridiculously well-made shootouts and car chases. A highlight is John's rampage through a nightclub, gunning down countless dozens of thugs in his pursuit of his dog's killer. As opposed to a lot of the uninspired, uninventive cinematic action releases of recent years, 'John Wick's' set-pieces maintain a highly fluid and energetic quality.The film itself has an interesting portrayal of the complex criminal underworld that lies right on the brink of normal society, a world that John is forced to return to. Everyone appears to know each other (John included), from 'waste disposers' to bartenders to hotel guests. It comes across as an unorthodox (yet welcome) hybrid of Guy Ritchie and David Lynch tropes. On the whole, 'John Wick' is a standout production in a list of otherwise banal recent action films, aided by its excellently-crafted actions scene, and a solid protagonist in the form of Keanu Reeve's John.","

"paul_haakonsen","4 July 2016","Without being able to claim to be a particular fan of Keanu Reeves, then I had very little expectations to ""John Wick"" prior to sitting down and watching it. I knew it was in the action thriller genre, and that was about it.And now that I have seen it, I must honestly admit that I was more than pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this movie. I was more than entertained by the storyline, and the sheer volume of action sequences in the movie is more than sufficient to keep any action fan more than happy. I will actually go as far as to saying that this is actually among the more enjoyable and entertaining of movies that I have seen starring Keanu Reeves.The storyline, in all its simplicity, is about a retired gun-for-hire, John Wick (played by Keanu Reeves), who just lost his beloved wife. And as a small puppy shows up at this doorstep, as a last gift from his departed wife, John finds some reason to continue on in his grief and his downtrodden world. However, when a group of Russian thugs steal his car and kills his puppy, they have no idea who they are messing with, nor the magnitude of his skills and capabilities.While the story is fairly simple, it is tremendously entertaining, and the added spice of all the action sequences really help lift up the movie to a very enjoyable level. The action sequences are really well executed and equally well filmed.""John Wick"" is not a movie that requires any thinking from the audience, so you just simply sit back and enjoy the action.I am rating ""John Wick"" a solid seven out of ten stars. And it was good to see a movie of this scale from Keanu Reeves. If you enjoy action movies, then ""John Wick"" is highly recommendable.","

"moviexclusive","22 October 2014","Keanu Reeves shot to superstardom in Speed and that was a stunning two decades ago. Five years after crashing a bus through LA, he reaffirmed his star status in the then groundbreaking sci-fi action flick, The Matrix. Since then, the actor of mixed ancestry has dabbled in a number of high-profile projects and indie titles, produced an acclaimed documentary and directed his very first feature. But he has yet found a role that ranked alongside Jack Traven and Neo.All thanks to stunt coordinators and performers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (founders of action outfit, 87Eleven), Reeves has finally found a character that redefined his flagging career. Forgive his almost soulless appearance in 47 Ronin, you want a badass Keanu Reeves action vehicle, you have it in John Wick. The script by the little known Derek Kolstad reeks of minimalism. It's purely a lazy action movie, one that frankly never pushes beyond the boundary. Yet somehow it works under the hands of Leitch and Stahelski and the casting of our leading man.With hardly a lull, Reeves plays a mysterious ex-assassin, a man so powerful at his craft that people jitters at the mere mention of his name. However, Wick decides to retire after his wife fell sick and after the death of his beloved partner, devoted his time to care for his pet dog â the last gift given by his late wife. Unfortunately, the son of a Russian mobster, Iosef (Alfie Allen from Game of Thrones) punctuates Wick's quiet life after he took a fancy to Wick's Ford Mustang. Isoef ambushed Wick at his home in the middle of the night, took his muscle car and gasp killed his dog! The ruthless act trigger the anger back in Wick and what follows is the ultimate revenge against those who are hired to stop him from killing Iosef and the target himself. The movie is structured predictably that you already knew what's coming. To its credit, John Wick is never pretentious, it served to entertain and it accomplished its goal with much ease in the end. Leitch and Stahelski are such old-timers in the stunt field that most of the action seen in Wick is both beautifully and brutally executed. Men are often stabbed, kicked, disabled and shot in the face and to the talented production designers, the numerous action sequences actually took place in a number of different locations such as a disco club, parking lot and hotel room just to give it a little variety. The raw bloody gunplay reminisces one of early John Woo movies and it's definitely a visual feast. Cinematographer Jonathan Sela (Max Payne, A Good Day to Die Hard) provides the movie with a chilling moody feel at the same time, keeping his lenses glued to the ground forsaking the usage of crappy shaky cams.Just when you thought Kolstad's storytelling is so uneventful, he manages to throw in surprises after surprises. Besides, the laugh- out-loud sardonic humour, the world of thugs, assassins in John Wick is much more than mere clichÃ©d tough Russian mobsters, a promising setup for more sequels to come. Killers stayed in a luxurious hotel and they trade using only gold coins. A specialized crew is hired to clean up crime scenes and disposing the bodies. There are rules to abide with and everyone in this world comes with a price.Besides Reeves doing his tough guy routine and should I add he is damn good at it, Bridget Moynahan (I, Robot) also has a small role as Wick's wife seen in a brief flashback montage. Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist (Ghost Protocol) plays the movie's main villain, Iosef's mobster daddy and he plays it uber-cool. Everyone's favourite character actors Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane play a fellow assassin and a mysterious hotel's owner respectively.When it comes to voting for a stylish action packed movie for 2014, John Wick easily wins hands down. If you missed Denzel Washington hunting down Russian thugs in The Equalizer, then don't miss Keanu Reeves hunting down Russian thugs. It's just as crazy but with a dog in the latter, I declared John Wick the winner. Who can resist a cute puppy with Bambi eyes?","

"BeneCumb","22 January 2015","I have always regarded Keanu Reeves a great actor, but some of his choices/opportunities have been bizarre - mildly speaking. Fortunately, John Wick puts Reeves back on track again - he is the real ""filler"" in this movie, there are a few short scenes without his presence, and quite often he is the only personality visible on screen. True, one can find similarities with his character in e.g. Matrix and A Scanner Darkly, and the plot has several flaws and airy-fairy moments, but all this is presented in a stylish and witty manner, with both multiple angles and endings. Reeves/Wick is a gloomy and firm man, his deeds are certain and final, yet dog- and wife-related scenes are nice and touching. And the locality of Hotel Continental is unconventional.Apart from Reeves, there are many other distinctive performances as well, practically all who have verbal roles. Michael Nyqvist (as Viggo Tarasov) is a due antagonist to Reeves; rather frequently, there is no proper confrontation because the ""bad guy"" is more versatile/fascinating than the ""good guy"" (or vice versa).All in all, the movie in question is no Tarantino, but yet a good entertaining action with pleasant performances.","

The directors of the film David Leitch and Chad Stahelski both do a excellent and fantastic job of directing this movie and I found out that these two are actually stunt men. The villain was good, the action scenes were shot perfectly. Towards the end of the movie felt a bit clichÃ© for me. You know in every action movie that the main hero is facing off the main bad guy and they shouting out one liners at each other, you know what I mean and that to me felt like the writer's got lazy half way through.John Wick has to be the biggest surprise for me with it's intelligent writing and nail biting action scenes.","

"Dan1863Sickles","4 June 2018","The three dumbest things in the world are Keanu Reeves, action movies, and music videos. So now, here's an action movie starring Keanu Reeves that's shot like a music video. I am overwhelmed by the accumulated dumbness. Imagine PAYBACK with Mel Gibson, only without the wit, guts, human suffering, and wisdom. And Mel's been replaced by Tab Hunter, Frankie Avalon, or someone like that. Imagine THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, only without the romance, elegance, tension, and simmering sexual heat. There's no Mira Sorvino here, and Chow Yun Fat has been replaced by Beavis and Butthead.All through this movie, there are moments that are laugh out loud stupid, where the film makers clearly expect the viewers to fall into a worshipful stupor and start jacking their bones. Wow, look how fast that car is going! Man, that is a sharp looking car! I am getting so hot now, just looking at that car! And the music is so LOUD, man. LOUD MUSIC MAKES ME SO HOT! And now guys are getting killed! Man, I love to see guys getting killed. LOUD MUSIC CARS GUITARS GUNSHOTS OH MY GOD I'm COMING RIGHT NOW!!!! And of course, Our Hero must look ""cool"" at all times. He can't just take his guns out of the closet. No, he has to take a SLEDGE HAMMER and SMASH the floor to dig out his old guns! So cool!!! And when the bad guys are coming, he has to put on a sharp, three-piece suit, with cuff links, so he can fist fight and pistol his way around. I mean, a ripped t-shirt and jeans might be better, yes? To move fast and have quick reflexes? But no, it's so much COOLER to watch him put on a suit and tie. With all that going on, take some time to notice the sadness on the faces of all these veteran actors. There's that old black guy from THE WIRE -- he looks almost grateful to be getting killed after five minutes. There's Willem Defoe -- he still hasn't forgiven himself for making all those Spider Man movies. Oh, but it's not just aging has-beens who are being humiliated here. Who's that good looking young chap running through the crowded disco in a towel? Can it be . . . can it be . . . it's Alfie ""THEON GREJOY"" Allen. Did you see him running through the crowd, looking like a goofball? No? Let's slow it down! How many minutes of Alfie running in a towel do we need to see? But it's okay, he's got tons of music blasting away. And it's LOUD!I really wanted Keanu to ask Alfie, ""did you pay the IRON PRICE for that car you stole?"" And then Alfie's last words could have been, ""what is dead may never die!""","

I like looking at Keanu as much as anyone but him punching a lot of people does not a good movie make. It's as good as the Taken sequels, that is not say not good at all. There is no time spent to create a world behind each character, it's just, here's a guy, punch him, shoot him. It feels like a cartoon for very stupid boys. There isn't a good line in the entire thing. The most memorable scene is a girl entering a swimming pool in high heels.","

Unlike The Expendables. This one is it. But if it dose not happen. Its sure to be a singular cult classic. Especially with its refusal to be a shoot em up style of show, but a shoot em in the face style of show.

"Robert_duder","17 November 2014","I went into John Wick nearly completely blind. I am certain I did not see a single trailer for it. I knew it had Keanu Reeves and I knew it was about a man out for vengeance when his dog is killed. It sounded almost silly but I expected there would be more to it and there was. Actually there is a whole lot of back story here and a million different directions this could go in if they chose to franchise it. Its a dark, twisted, violent, martial arts, action film that was often brilliantly choreographed and reminded me of perhaps a Luc Besson film or John Woo (only good...I'm not a Woo fan.) Its not quite an 80's action throwback but more of a 90's action throwback. Fans of The Matrix will rejoice in this return to that style of film for Reeves. The story is actually very good and you very quickly begin to understand just how dangerous John Wick is. Essentially you start the film knowing nothing about him but you quickly understand a little about his past and the world he ran in and how dangerous he is. One of the best things about John Wick is the world the film makers bother to create behind the story going on. You have a mysterious underground organization of hit men and women, a club that is a ""safe zone"" and a network of killers that rub elbows together. All of that collides into this blood bath and its insanely fun to watch.I can't honestly say I've see Keanu Reeves in anything I was impressed with since Constantine. I feel like he often forgets what people love to see him in and that has always been action. This returns him to full form and he doesn't miss a beat. I don't know how much of his own stunts and fighting he does but he kicks some serious a$$ and looks great doing it. I would watch this film a second time just to catch some of the more intense moments. Alfie Allen is fantastic as the whiny privileged son of a mobster who crosses John Wick. You actually ache to watch Allen get destroyed and he's perfectly irritating in all the right ways. In order to make sure the story has a proper villain we have Michael Nyqvist as his father. He definitely has an air of villainy to him and he's the perfect adversary to Wick. You can just feel the history between the two characters. Willem Dafoe is fantastic in a small role as a fellow assassin. We know that he and Reeves also have history and we don't know what and we never really find out but we know there is a relationship there. Dean Winters is the perfect number one henchman and his role is perfectly used and placed, Adrianne Palicki is actually amazing as a seriously deranged female assassin (she could stand to have a whole movie on her alone), and honourable mentions to Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, and John Leguizamo in cameo roles that are really terrific. No matter how big or small a role in this film is, I thought they did a great job at establishing this world John Wick exists in and the circles he once ran in and with. I want more!! That is the best compliment I can give.Now this is director Chad Stahelski's first directorial credit. This usually means a film reeks of inexperience. However, if you look at the sheer number of films that Stahelski has worked on in stunts and assistant directing and producing, you will see that he has been building an incredible resume of experience and John Wick proves that. He has a style that is near perfect this revenge type of martial arts film. I cringed, I nearly cried, I cheered, I veered, I didn't want it to end. Its not a critically brilliant film but its nearly perfectly entertaining. The story is a little predictable in the idea that a hit-man leaves the business because he falls in love only to be drawn back in when something terrible happens. That's not a new concept although his anger being triggered by the death of a puppy is a new angle. Action fans take note because if you haven't seen John Wick you are missing out!! This is a return to greatness for Reeves and I could easily watch this again and may even add it to my collection. It holds nothing back and lives up to its ""R"" Rated which is also unusual nowadays. Because of this film I anxiously await to see what Stahelski does next. 8.5/10","

"CowherPowerForever","28 October 2014","Keanu Reeves is back and better than ever. After a long drought on bad quality films, Reeves aimed to get back into the good graces of audiences by making this completely over the top action film. While the story is pretty generic, the action and the directing is simply top notch. If you want intense action scenes that are simply amazing R rated fun, mixed in with some fabulous acting, then you are looking in the right direction. This is my review of John Wick.The film was written by Derek Kolstad and this is only his third writing credit. His prior two movies were both direct to home video action films. I have watched both of those movies he wrote(One in the Chamber and The Package). Having already watched some of his efforts in the past, I knew story wise this wasn't going to be perfect. However, the story is good cheesy fun. Reeves character(John Wick) has a tough life with the recent passing of his wife. She leaves him this sweet little dog as a gift to remember her to grieve with someone. One afternoon Wick is at a gas station and these thugs start up a conversation about his sweet 1969 Ford Mustang. The one thug ask Wick how much he wants for the car, only to reply that it is not for sale. They of course aren't happy, so they break into his house at night to kill the dog and rough him up. They of course have no idea who this person at the gas station was. This starts the chain of events that leads Wick back into the game. While the underlying story is cheesy, it is sweet fun for this genre of films. While Kolstad's effort won't net him any awards, it should make his name more popular as the characters and the set up for the action is simply amazing. I give his effort on this film a big thumbs up.The film was directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. Neither of these two have ever directed a film before. They have both worked as stunt coordinators. Reading into that before you go see the movie could sound some alarms, but they shot this film perfectly in my opinion. The action scenes are fast and very intense. The hand to hand combat is stellar work, and with no shaky cam action, the audience can really savor each moment in the bigger action scenes. While there is some downtime in the film, the acting plugs those holes. Keanu Reeves headlines a fabulous cast that also includes Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, Dean Winters, Adrianne Palicki, and Ian McShane. The acting as I just said was top level in this film. Having so many acting legends in this one film is great because action movies do have downtime where characters need to drive the film. While there is some downtime earlier in the film, the amazing acting more than makes up for it. The first outing for these two is none other than something perfectly done. This is a fun action film that hardcore fans of the genre will love to watch. The R rating also helps as there is a great deal of blood and other over the top moments that you can't get away with on a PG-13 film. This was a fantastic effort and I cannot wait to see their projects in the future.Joel J. Richard scored the film with some original music from Tyler Bates. Both have worked on bigger action films, so they know how to add a great deal of depth to a score. I really enjoy the score in this film. The bigger action scenes have some great pieces as the action is moving along. There is never really a moment when I was underwhelmed by the score. I love a great score and this is certainly one of the better scores from 2014. Both Richard and Bates get a big thumbs up in my opinion.Overall, this is one thrilling joy ride. The action is fast paced, with some downtime that fills in perfectly with some great acting. The actions scenes are shot perfectly and the hand to hand combat is very intense. My only real complaint is some of the downtime tends to drag on a bit, but it doesn't hurt the film all that much. Fans of the 1980s action genre will love this film. Those on the fence, well jump on over. This is a great film to see and it is worth every penny.I also want to talk about the IMAX version as that is the version I watched. The IMAX version adds a tremendous amount of quality sounds, which in turn adds to the fantastic score. The picture level of course is certainly not there as the film was not shot using IMAX cameras. If you can view the IMAX version on a discount showing that would be the best bet. Otherwise, I don't really think it was worth the extra price of admittance.9/10","

"sddavis63","9 September 2017","As the title clearly tells us, this movie is really about one man - John Wick. John is a sort of super (perhaps even super-human) hit man for the Russian Mob. But he's retired. He found love; he got married; everything was great; he left the life. But his wife got sick and then died, and as her parting gift to the devastated John, she arranges for him to be sent a puppy after she died. The puppy comforts him in his grief. Until ... One day he has an encounter with the son of the Russian mob boss he used to work for. They don't know each other. The guy falls in love with John's car, and later breaks into John's house, beats John up, kills John's puppy and steals John's car. It was the killing of the puppy - the last link with his beloved wife - that pushed John over the top. He's back, and he's out for revenge: bloody, merciless and remorseless revenge against anybody and everybody even remotely involved with this heinous act.That's it, more or less. The movie then goes through a whole series of bloody gunfights and fistfights and martial arts sequences as John (Keanu Reeves) single-handedly wreaks havoc on the Russian Mob in New York City. The fight scenes go on and on and on. They seem never-ending. It was a very one-dimensional part for Reeves (but, then again, most of the characters in this were one dimensional.) The point of the movie wasn't to tell a story or to give us meaningful moments and characters. They were all pretty one dimensional, working with a plot that was straightforward and largely predictable. This is obviously all leading up to the climactic confrontation. Admittedly, I wasn't entirely sure who John's final confrontation was going to be with until the son was killed with almost a half hour left to go. Clearly it wasn't him. So it goes on and on and on for a while longer.Personally, I found the last half hour quite tedious viewing. If you really like this kind of genre - violent and bloody action with little or no story - then this is a movie you've got to watch. I have to admit that this just really wasn't my style, even though I can appreciate a man wanting to take revenge for the killing of his puppy! (3/10)","

"dramafreak42","27 February 2015","Whether or not you are going to enjoy this movie depends entirely on what it is you hope to get out of it. I fear for many it has been over-hyped, or just the high rating on the page leads folks to expect more than the movie is actually trying to sell. What it's selling is extremely well done action, and if you're content with just that then it will deliver in spades.Keanu Reeves plays the retired super-hit-man John Wick. He's pulled back into the world he left behind when the arrogant and ignorant son of a mob boss roughs him up for kicks (it's a little more personal than that, but I don't want to spoil it.) This sends John on a rampage through an underground world of mafia figures and hired killers. It really is that simple.While the plot is as bare bones as it gets, there's a surprisingly deep world being built. It's a world in which there is a hotel specifically set up for hired killers to whole up in while they're on the job. It's a world where a body clean up crew is just a phone call away. It's a stylized world to be sure, but it's an intriguing one as well. It also helps that it's populated by some recognizable faces. Just the casting of folks like Ian McShane, Willem Dafoe, and John Leguizamo turns what are fairly thin characters into something that works. Many of the actors bring a certain caliber just by their presence that makes this world work.But really, you're here for the action. And it's stellar. Firstly there are wonderfully long takes, no rapid cut trickery here. You know exactly what's going on and where everything is. And I personally LOVE the fighting style that John uses. While he appears to be a decent shot, his tactic is to get in close and then pump his target full of bullets. It's actually been a long standing pet peeve of mine that in so many action movies, the bad guys (especially henchmen) go down with a single bullet to some unspecified part of the body. John Wick is a professional, and he takes no chances. Even one of the innumerable body guards is going to get three shots to the gut and two to the head, just so John can be certain that he doesn't have to deal with that person again. It's fast, it's efficient and it's thrilling.The film loses a little big of steam towards the end. The natural climax of the film happens with about 20 minutes left to go, and the final action scene isn't as thrilling or as poignant as it wants to be. That said it's not a deal breaker, and the action scenes that come before the climax more than make it worth going through the slightly weaker ending.","

"SnoopyStyle","25 June 2015","John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a reformed assassin but his beloved who reformed him has died. After her death, she sends him a dog to love. Then the impetuous Iosef (Alfie Allen), son of mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), steals his car and kills his dog. Iosef doesn't know what he's gotten himself into. Viggo tries to kill John and places a $2 million contract on him. He gets John's old colleges Marcus (Willem Dafoe) to agree. John goes to the Continental hotel where assassins congregate and nobody is allowed to do business. John finds Iosef there while Viggo doubles the reward to break the house rule. Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki) takes him up on his offer.Keanu Reeves has become an expert in playing this type of characters. There are great looking action. The best is his fight with Palicki. It's all amazingly shoot. The simple story is better than most with some nice touches. I do have a couple of small problems with the plot. I don't like that he kept missing Iosef in the hotel because he had shown that he almost never misses. I don't mind not killing Iosef so early. He just needs to scamper away before the shooting starts. I also don't understand why Wick doesn't get reprimanded by the hotel. That kind of stuff does bug me a little but overall, it's a fun action movie.","

You could have got a film student to write and direct the entire thing. I'm flabbergasted that people actually think this is a great film. What's so unique about it that no other film has got. The acting is wooden, the scenes unbelievable and this just a payday for those involved. Trust me, you've seen it all before. If you're willing to put all common sense behind you and take everything at face value then perhaps this film is for you. Oh my god, it's just finishing as I write, and I can't believe the final scene! Now I know this film was rated by kids for kids.","

"ethanoel","22 March 2015","though i usually enjoy more movies where there is a delicate balance between substance and style - the film has an intelligent story and characterization that produces deep emotions, too - i also find great and perhaps a little guilty pleasure watching action films once in a while but this is one of the films in its genre in which i simply do not find anything enjoyable or pleasurable at all. it is totally boring and utterly ridiculous watching experience and i only wonder why on earth it was ever even made in the first place? there is NOTHING original. everything has been seen hundreds of times in hundreds of other movies...the characters are silly the story is totally predictable almost in every turn and there is absolutely no humor which may be the worst thing of all: all the people concerned producing this piece of stupid crap take themselves so damn too seriously and that is the most apparent source of yawn breaking boredom most viewers must feel at it. it is just another stupid piece of dull action cinema.keanu reeves who is still a sight for most female and many male sore eyes even in his fifties cannot save it (i think quite few women would have the overwhelming interest to watch the film despite its handsome protagonist). reeves as a retired professional hit man is as irritating cardboard character as anything else in the film. for most male viewers it is still enough if you slaughter a hundred guys around you with a relevant weapons arsenal and sprinkle blood on the walls in endless killing euphoria while on your vengeance tour de force but that kind of treatment when consistent all the way from the beginning to the end rarely makes a very good action movie. there must be something more.i admit that south koreans who are the real masters of the action genre nowadays have sometimes managed to do a fair movie from the scratch but this film crew has not been able to do so.total waste of time.","

If a person is able to survive certain dangerous situations a minimum expectation is that said person will demonstrate the skills necessary to come out alive. Neither the author of this story nor the screenwriter deemed it necessary to provide the protagonist with any such skills. This film's only redeeming feature for me is that the dog is nice.","

A few days after he receives his new companion, a group of men wanting to steal his car, break in and beat him up and kill his dog. When he recovers, he sets to get the ones who killed his dog. He learns that the leader is the son of his former employer. And the man, wanting to protect his son, tries to take care of Wick, but once a killer, always a killer. There's still life in the old dog yet......,John Wick is one of those strange films that comes out of nowhere and smacks you right in the face, it's an unexpected gem of a movie. The makers of the movie know that Reeves can't act, hence the limited dialogue he has, but also know that he can carry a film like this, so the endless set pieces look brilliant too.And for Reeves, its a win win situation. He hasn't been in a decent, big release film for some time now, and here, he proves he still has it. Screen presence that is, not acting chops.Plus its one of those films that just doesn't try too hard to be anything other than it is, a revenge thriller, plain and simple. What is clever is that it's not just the dog Wick is peeved about, it's the fact that this was the last thing his wife gave him, and for Wick, the dog signified ease of the grieving process, and her legacy would sort of continue every time he looked in the puppy's eyes.If your a huge dog lover, be prepared to be upset, that's all I'm saying on that matter, but rest assured, the punishment fits the crime, over and over, and over again.Its a very slick affair, the action is effortlessly cool, and the nightclub scene, is one of the highlights of the whole movie.At times,the movie reminded me of 'Wanted', especially when it was set in the strange hotel for hit men, and then other times, it reminded me of 'Crank' because of its bizarre characters, and bonkers narrative.If you are a fan of Reeves, here's the movie you've been waiting for side that awful rave in Zion, for others, its a visual feast, all style over substance, with some great support from the likes of McShane, Dafoe, and even Alfie Allen.Its Most Excellent, and never once Bogus...","

"jboothmillard","23 September 2017","I knew I wanted to see this movie one day, but after hearing so many recommendations, knowing it was a surprise box office hit, and obviously it spawned an equally successful sequel, I could not resist it. Basically John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has lost his wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) following her terminal illness, to cope with her death, he receives a Beagle puppy named Daisy, as per her instructions. John bonds with the dog, they spend the day driving in his vintage 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1, at a gas station he encounters a trio of Russian gangsters, their leader Iosef Tarasov (Game of Thrones' Alfie Allen) insists on buying his car, John refuses to sell it. The mobsters follow John home that night, knock him unconscious, steal his car, and kill Daisy. Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop run by Aurelio (John Leguizamo), he recognises the car, upon learning that he stole it from John Wick, he punches Iosef and throws him out. John visits Aurelio, who tells him Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Michael Nyqvist), the head of the Russian crime syndicate in New York City. Viggo, finding out about Iosef's actions, beats and berates him, he tells him John Wick was his best assassin, nicknamed ""Baba Yaga"" (or the ""boogeyman""). When John wanted to retire and marry, Viggo gave him an ""impossible task"", implied to involve multiple assassinations, John succeeded, establishing the Tarasov syndicate. Viggo calls John to stop him seeking revenge, he silently refuses, so Viggo sends a twelve-man squad to kill him, but John kills them, and has the bodies professionally removed by Charlie (Commando's David Patrick Kelly) and his team. Viggo is unsurprised and puts a $2 million bounty on John's head, personally offering a contract to John's mentor Marcus (Willem Dafoe), meanwhile John stays at the Continental Hotel, which caters exclusively to the criminal underworld and permits no ""business"" on its premises. John learns from the Continental's owner Winston (Ian McShane), that Iosef is being protected at Viggo's nightclub the Red Circle, John kills his way to Iosef, but henchman Kirill (Daniel Bernhardt) ambushes John, allowing Iosef to escape. John tends to his injuries at the Continental, there assassin and his former acquaintance Ms. Perkins (Adrianne Palicki) sneaks into his room to kill him, but Marcus alerted him, he subdues Perkins and forces her to reveal where Viggo's front is, she knocks Perkins unconscious and leaves her with fellow assassin Harry (Clarke Peters) for punishment, but she breaks free and kills him. Little Russia church serves as Viggo's front, John travels there, destroys the hoard of money and blackmail material, Viggo and his team arrive, John ambushes them, but is subdued and captured. Viggo taunts John for thinking he could leave his old life behind, before John can be killed, Marcus intervenes again, John frees himself, kills Kirill and confronts Viggo, at gunpoint he reveals Iosef's location. John travels to Iosef's ""safe house"" and kills him, while Perkins tells Viggo that John and Marcus have been in contact, Viggo has Marcus tortured at his home, before he is executed, Viggo calls John to report this, and plans to have Perkins ambush him, but Perkins is called to see Winston, she is executed fro breaking the Continental's rules. Winston calls John to inform him that Viggo plans to escape by helicopter, John races to the harbour, killing the remaining henchmen, John and Viggo engage in a fistfight on the dock, John disarms Viggo pulling out a knife, then kills him. In the end, John is wounded, he stops at a waterfront animal clinic to treat his wound, and he takes a pit bull puppy who was supposed to be euthanized, John and the dog walk home on the boardwalk where he had his last date with Helen. Also starring Dean Winters as Avi, Omer Barnea as Gregori and Toby Leonard Moore as Victor. Reeves proves a fantastic choice as the former hit-man that will not be messed with, it is a simple revenge plot as a man seeks retribution for those who stole his car and killed his dog, but the fast-paced editing, escalating body count and over-the-top death and fight sequences are highly skillful and well choreographed, the violence adds to the entertainment, it feels like something fresh, a fantastic action thriller. Very good!","

"rawkidd","14 January 2015","It's good to see Keanu back on the silver screen but unfortunately this film wasn't his best choice. If you're into shooting, killing or ""one man against the rest of the world"" then this is for you. The movie reminded me of 3rd person shooter game, not only because John Wick moves like a game figure, also because there's seems to be a certain range of skills he uses to bringing the bad guys down.If you're into thrill, story or dialog: simply forget about it, there's nothing like that in this movie. The plot is so weak, I think you hardly can call it a plot. It's rather a ""cause and effect"" thing. You did me harm, so I'm gonna do you harm too. That's it.What I liked the most about the movie was it's cinematography and style and that actually kept me watching until the end. The CGI is OK, although in some scenes (shooting from close range) too obvious.All in all, I found this movie very disappointing and I think it's more a huge budget B-Movie.","

"BrentHankins","24 October 2014","Despite starring in some undeniably iconic roles early in his career, Keanu Reeves has struggled to maintain any sort of momentum, with every critically acclaimed performance or box office success followed by a string of disappointing and underwhelming projects. But thanks to his former stunt double Chad Stahelski, Reeves once again finds himself headlining a solid action flick that has plenty of buzz around it.Despondent over the death of his wife, retired assassin John Wick (Reeves) spends his days moping around his house, with a beagle puppy as his only companion. The dog arrived on his doorstep shortly after his wife's funeral, a final gift so that John wouldn't have to carry on alone. But an untimely run-in with Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), the son of a local Russian mobster, results in the theft of John's 1969 Ford Mustang and the death of his puppy, leaving John with nothing to love - and nothing to lose.Yes, that's a ridiculous segue, but it also perfectly conveys the tone of John Wick. The premise is unapologetically silly, but Reeves approaches the material with such fervor that we quickly forget about his motivations. It doesn't matter that Wick is singlehandedly disassembling the infrastructure of the Russian crime syndicate because of a dog - what matters is how much fun the film is having while he does it. Wick stalks from scene to scene with the precision of The Terminator, scarcely wasting a single movement as he dispatches bad guys in impressive numbers, with equally impressive methods. Surrounding the nearly non-stop action is an interesting mix of supporting characters, including Ian McShane as the owner of a hotel for assassins, whose roles dictate that no business be conducted on the premises, and Willem Dafoe as Wick's mentor, Marcus, himself an expert sharpshooter. And we can't forget Adrianne Palicki, a fellow contract killer out to collect the $2 million bounty placed on Wick's head by Tarasov's father, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), who also happens to be Wick's former employer.Stahelski, who first doubled for Reeves on The Matrix before moving on to several other films with the actor, including Constantine, Man of Tai Chi and both Matrix sequels, has teamed up with longtime collaborator David Leitch for John Wick, a stylish revenge thriller that heralds the arrival of a bold new voice. While Stahelski is credited as the director due to DGA regulations, this is very much a team effort, as Stahelski and Leitch have channeled their decades of experience as stunt coordinators and second unit directors into a remarkably original film that boasts some of the best action sequences in recent memory.While John Wick certainly isn't a perfect film - the script is paper-thin in more than a few places, and Reeves has a handful of laughably poor dialogue deliveries - it never stops having fun. This is a film that refuses to take itself seriously, opting instead to just strap in, buckle up and enjoy the ride. And as long as audiences can follow suit, rather than searching for some deeper meaning, they should find themselves pleased with the results.-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com","

"Matt_Layden","17 January 2015","John Wick is an interesting film that came and went before our eyes. Yet those who did decide to give it a chance, seem to love it very much. It's 'Certified Fresh' on Rottentomatoes and has a 7.5 rating on IMDb as of right now. Impressive for a film that is basically one shoot out after the next....after the next....after the next.An ex hit-man comes out of retirement after he's attacked by three thugs in his home. This attack leaves him beaten, without a car and a dead dog, which was given to him by his recently deceased wife. Big mistake. Once these guys tries to sell the muscle car to a garage that strips parts, the owner seems to instantly recognize it. The man asks, who's car this is. Who cares? The young spoiled brat replies. I can tell you one thing, we beat his ass to get it, and his stupid dog too. Bam, punched in the face. The kid goes crying to his mob boss of a father, who then calls up that mechanic. Did you punch my son in the face? Yes sir, I did. Why, he asked. Well sir, because he stole John Wick's car...and killed his dog. Oh crap.This sets up the film, the classic revenge tale. Nothing really new here. We've seen dozens of films where the retired killer has to come out of retirement to revenge the death of a loved one. This time it happens to be a canine. The dog is adorably cute and my wife was in tears...TEARS I TELL YOU, when they killed the poor pup. About one scene before it happened, she says to me, ""Are they going to kill the dog?"" Terrified of the answer that I would not give her. Well, yes, they did. She instantly wanted John Wick to kill EVERYONE. So I guess when a dog gets it, you instantly want those responsible dead. Funny, I feel the same way. When people die on film, no big deal, but when an animal dies, all hell breaks lose. After that is out of the way, John Wick suits up to take out those who have wronged him. It just happens to be the son of his former boss. So when the boss finds out, he knows he's in trouble. So now he has to get to Wick before Wick gets to them. Thus, the body count piles up. It piles up in a finely tuned operatic fashion, as the action sequences are some of the best in the last few years. Wick uses his guns with precision. Shot to the chest, then to the head. It's robotic. One man against a dozen? Fair fight.To say the action in John Wick is stylized in an understatement. This is one of the best action films in years. Chad Stahelski, a stunt coordinator, makes his directing debut here. So he knows his way around a fight, being responsible for such films as the Expendables, The Wolverine, Tron: Legacy, and many many more. I like this new trend of giving people from different departments a chance at the directing chair. See what they can bring to the table. The man clearly knows his stuff, so give him a script to shoot and see what he can achieve. He nails it here. One impressive sequence has Wick going into a club, with multiple levels and rooms and takes out the bad guys one by one. First silently, then when all hell breaks lose, with calm and ease. Bottom line: This is one FUN film.Reeves never impresses with his acting ability. It's kind of a running gag with people that he cannot act his way out of a paper bag. One scene here has him actually showing some emotion, which is when he reads the letter from his wife after receiving the dog. The rest of the film is how bad ass can Reeves look while taking out dozens of people. The answer, really bad ass. Familiar faces show up, such as Willem Dafoe, as another assassin. Adrianne Palicki as a beautiful....well...assassin. Michael Nyqvist, from the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo series, plays the Russian Mobster, whose son, Alfie Allen aka Theon Greyjoy, gets him into this mess. As if we needed another reason to hate Theon. Finally Ian McShane as a friendly face in a crowd of so few. The world created in John Wick is interesting to me. These assassins have gold coins that get them into these places that only the secret society of assassins can access. There are hidden clubs, hotel rooms, etc. How can all these assassins and hit-men be in a club and not want to shoot each other. Well, there seem to be certain rules. Don't break them, or there might be consequences. Those club scenes are really fun. Jonathan Sela, the DOP, bathes the film is icy blues and nice neon lighting for those club scenes. Giving it a heightened look and feel. Everything about the film feels smooth as ice, just like John Wick. The directing style reflects the lead character. Aggressive when it needs to be, but calm and collected most of the time. When I say aggressive, boy do I mean aggressive. Wick acts like a man with nothing to lose, no fear. He will walk right into the lions den to get the job done. John Wick is one of the biggest surprises of 2014 for me. While some might call it a no brainer repetitive action film I call it high class action fun. FUN is the key word here. Watching John Wick dispose of those bodies was fun. Seeing this society of people who all know each other was fun. Seeing Keanu Reeves back in the limelight doing what he does best? You called it...fun.","

"dmhughes-448-695102","13 November 2014","It's actually hard to remember the last time when Keanu Reeves was in a truly noteworthy, memorable, and quotable film, despite him being one of my favorite actors. 47 Ronin (2013), aside from being a notorious box office bomb, was completely forgettable; Generation UmÂ (2012) was a mess; The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008) was an unnecessary remake, and Man of Tai Chi (2013), despite being a solid and well-made directorial debut from Reeves, didn't leave much of a lasting impression.However, I've always felt that Reeves would eventually make another film that was worth the price of admission, and not just a cursory glance and rental in a video store. Thankfully, Reeves has made a fantastic return to his old, action-movie roots with John Wick (2014), a film that seems to have been designed specifically for fans of Reeves, and after finding out about how the film has performed better than expected at the box office, I can only hope that this film will help Reeves get back into the spotlight. He's definitely earned it as he is in one of the best films of the year.The actual plot of the film is incredibly simplistic, which in this case is a good thing. Keanu Reeves plays John Wick, a retired hit man who has recently lost his wife, Helen (briefly played by Bridget Moynahan) to a disease (that is not clarified). Wick finds out that his wife left him a puppy, named Daisy, but before Wick can attempt to move on with his life, Russian mobster Iosef (played by Theon Greyjoy actor Alfie Allen) and his thugs break into Wick's home, mug him, steal his '69 Mustang, and then kill Daisy. John Wick then grabs his old guns and returns to the violent (also sophisticated, old-fashioned, and honorable) mob world that he had once escaped in order to find Iosef and exact his terrible vengeance. I must admit I think this is easily the best performance Reeves has given since The Matrix sequels came out back in 2003. John Wick is a man of few words, but his expressions and actions (mostly violent) more than make up for it, which really works in Reeves' favor (dialogue has never been his best attribute, and I'm looking at you Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992)). Wick is by no means a hero; every character Wick runs into remarks about his terrible and legendary past, and I quickly realized that Wick was simply the best bad man in a world of terrible characters. Reeves clearly gave his all in this film, as in every action scene I could tell his career decision to perform a majority of his own stunts pays off; I never saw Keanu Reeves taking down bad guys in this film, I always saw John Wick, and it was a performance that truly felt real.Reeves may be the star of the show, but he also has an impressive ensemble cast helping him out. Michael Nyqvist (of the Swedish The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy fame) is excellent as Viggo Tarasov, the leader of the New York Russian mob, Wick's former employer, and Iosef's father. You can tell that Viggo is the sort of man who is willing to place the life of his family (no matter how idiotic) over his former friendship with Wick, which creates an intriguing conflict. Alfie Allen plays another greedy, foolish character, which has become a well played, but too familiar archetype. William Dafoe and Adrianne Palicki, have solid bits as Marcus and Perkins, close associates/enemies of Wick, and John Leguizamo and Ian McShane have memorable but important cameos as Aurelio and Winston. What impressed me the most about this film, besides the excellent action, slick and stylish choreography, a diverse and cool soundtrack, and great performances, was the world that Wick inhabits. It is revealed that Wick is a former member of the Continental, a society of hit men/assassins who reside in a fancy hotel, and live by a strict code of honor, chivalry, and rules, and if these rules are broken, there can be severe consequences. It was really creative, and I found it to be a world that could be expanded upon in future (fingers crossed) installments.John Wick is an action film that arrived at a time when a film of this caliber is so desperately needed. First, it managed to bring Keanu Reeves back into the spotlight; second, it's an old fashioned action film that still managed to feel fresh; and finally, it's a film that I could tell had a lot of heart and effort in it. I truly hope that Reeves' efforts will result in a sequel or similar film, and a resurgence of interest in actor who played The One. Overall, John Wick is a blast, and is a must-see for any fan of the action genre.Final Verdict: 9/10","

"aunggebi","30 January 2015","It is B level action movie. You can easily remind of other movies like this. Equillibrium, District 13, The transpoter and many other action movies with handsome, heroic guy. Keanu fights usually with guns in this movie. But it brings more body action into the shooting scenes, so it becomes more stylish. Great to watch it at home, not boring at all, if you don't expect something like 007 series with Daniel Craig or Born series. Keanu kept his face and body almost perfect, so he is still handsome and fit, good enough for the film like this. But the enemies have less impression. They are fine but not new, bit similar to villains from 90's action movies. I recommend this movie if you are looking for something easy and fun, and you've already watched every other great action movies like Born Ultimatium or 007 Casino Royal.","

"thesar-2","19 March 2015","FINALLY. What seems like 30 movies I've seen with Keanu, he's impressed me.John Wick is anything but original and yetÂit's thoroughly entertaining and just my type of bad guy/revenge flick. Not since 1999's Payback have I been this pleased. It's one of those movies I just finished and want to see all over again.Through and through, 90% of this has been done before, but since Keanu finally stood up and acted and since it takes no prisoners with its brutality and shameless acts of gun violence, it's one for the books. John Wick's the stereotypical badass retiree who's pulled back in on a whim and hell, everyone better watch their back. Reminding me a lot of both Payback and Eastern Promises, not to mention every single ""One- last-job-before-or-after-retirement"" plot, John Wick seems to separate itself with a Keanu you finally root for.Literally, there's not much to say but to enjoy the enormously action packed ride of John, his past, his presence and how many bullets it takes to provide vengeance. It's a pity this didn't make more at the box-office. I could see this on repeat and not get bored.* * *Final thoughts: Make your life complete with a double-punch/double- feature of this and Payback. (NOT the director's sh|t take of Payback. Just the original theatrical release.) Both are similar and will be having you root for the bad guy.","

"okakadogs","20 August 2023","My favorite action movie of all time. I've never watched the other movies in this saga, but this universe is sensational. Keanu Reeves as John Wick is wonderful. All the characters are spectacular. You can feel the panic in their eyes when they hear that John Wick is coming after them. And a wonderful thing this movie does (at least for me) is make us root for John Wick to end everyone. I know it's not just because of the dog that he went after them but that motivation is totally defensible for me who loves animals. This movie is very really wonderful. Keanu Reeves.

"aharmas","26 October 2014","This is a welcome surprise. Who would have thought Keanu could play such a cool character with that much conviction? He does a perfect job here, displaying the right attitude and making sure every shot hits its target. It's all very simple. He's a grieving widower, and one arrogant and spoiled jerk comes and messes with him. By doing so, Wick is forced out of retirement because someone has decided to ruin his late wife's legacy.It might look like a silly vendetta to a few, but this is the type of film where there's not much need for emotional speeches and long flashbacks. It's pretty much understood this man is capable of delivering the goods while working, but he appreciated what an alternate lifestyle offered and regrets losing it. Spending a few years in retirement hasn't dulled his skills. As he hunts his prey, we see his exchanges with a few of the people in his previous world, and it's obvious that he occupied a special place there. He commands respect and is well liked/respected. He knows how to follow the rules, express his gratitude to those who help him, and ironically, he is well, a good guy in the middle of this netherworld.After the break-in in Wick's house, it becomes clear, he won't stop until he gets what he wants. In a perfectly cast part, we enjoy every step he takes seeking retribution. Yes, there's plenty of violence, but it's o.k. to see the good guy get even. He's not immortal or invulnerable. He gets pretty beat up a couple of times, but courtesy of a clever script, he manages to pull through, with the help of a couple of friends, and a very interesting deal near the end.It appears all is properly resolved by the end, buy we can only hope there's more of this quiet hero in the future. This has been a good year for this type of characters, and I'm surprised audiences have not quite responded. They're the ones missing on the some of the best thrillers of the year. Just go in, don't think too much, and enjoy.","

"mbor1800","31 October 2014","First of all, there are obviously two versions of this movie, as reviews sway from ""top notch"" straight to ""low bottom"", deadly missing the golden average. I watched the second version. The movie ""John Wick"" exploits the idea of bad Russians, and how they are put in place by a retired hit-man (John Wick). The plot is extremely straightforward and would be easily fit for a video- or a computer game without any changes. There are no intriguing twists or any interesting supporting characters. Humour is absent completely, but for one small joke. Plenty of music, which has good tempo but a bit loud, as if movie-makers tried to compensate for bland taste with high decibels. The mobsters are very well portrayed as degenerate half-wits with very basic vocabulary, making one to think that they really should be put in prison for mentally-challenged rather than brutally shot-up, quite frequently right in their silly heads. Speaking of which â shooting scenes are reasonably well orchestrated, but when it comes to hand combat, for some reason characters would forget karate, jiu-jitsu, kung-fu etc., and instead resort to classic wrestling which looks comical to me. All-in-all, I caught myself looking at the watch anticipating when the digits 23.00.oo appear. That's how interesting this movie was. And I do not understand why Keanu Reeves walked into this one. ********************FUTHER TEXT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*******************Just one thing â all killers/assassins in the state of New York know each other very well. The do not hide under false names in some forsaken motels/bungalows. No. They live large and, judging by John Wick, for years have been re-elected as local hit-man of the year. They also have this secret hide-out that happens to be a luxury hotel with all the perks, except a swimming pool on the roof-top (coming next year?). And they use this secret currency in a form of special coins (goodbye US dollar) that are so unique that no one can churn out a thousand of them per hour using basic stamping machinery and ruin their fragile assassin economy. Yeah. On top of everything police, FBI, CIA, and even NSA (now without Mr. Snowden, but still running strong) have no idea what is going on under their noses in the middle of New York. This was the moment the movie turned from bad action into bad comedy for me.","

"fredrikgunerius","16 August 2023","The world of hitmen and mobsters is revitalized in this razor-sharp hybrid of sizzling action and stylish noir evocative of the old hard-boiled detective genre. Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as the icy, superhuman hitman who finds himself making an involuntary comeback in the business after his wife dies and he falls victim to a violent burglary. Enter mega kill-mode! Naturally, Wick's skill is way beyond belief, and the film is willing to make every kind of concession in order to satisfy its own vanity, but it is so forward-moving and enterprising that it almost makes you believe it isn't completely self-centered and intrinsically clichÃ©-ridden. John Wick is great fun for those who think stuff like this is great fun.","

"MovieCriticOnline","19 September 2023","3 stars for mindless entertainment.... but that's it.You REALLY have to suspend your disbelief in order to enjoy this movie.The writing was cliche and lazy. Lead lost his wife, gets replaced by a puppy that gets killed by some random high class bad people that seem to have nothing better to do than to steal a guy's car.I'll take $200 for things that never happened.Lets ignore the fact that Wick killed probably 100 people in this film, but none of them were able to hit him with the many bullets shot at him.When they finally had a chance to kill him after he got captured, instead of just shooting him, they of course, had to bring him to some remote warehouse where the villain gives him a Bond speech (how many times have we seen this?) before using a plastic bag to kill him. Why didn't they just shoot him when they captured him? Why use a plastic bag?All they did was basically remake Taken, which at least was a bit more realistic and seem to have more purpose.Then the acting was pretty horrendous. If you enjoy some total mindless entertainment, then go watch. If not, there are way better action movies that don't take themselves too seriously.","

"djmotiv","14 January 2015","I'm a wee bit conflicted about this movie because I grew up with my Dad being a huge fan of the Dirty Harry, Charles Bronson genre of action films - typically the story would be: Innocent looking man loses wife or children or both to baddies, innocent looking man turns out to be a bad ass and takes revenge on baddies, kills everyone - the end. Now, if you traded the wife for a car and the children for a car, you would be spot on.It did seem a bit silly that all of this was over a, and I quote, ""f**king dog*. So much so that every time someone said ""f**king dog"" I found it funny.All of that aside, this movie is action packed almost from the start to the very end. Aspects of it were silly and unbelievable but that's in keeping with the nature of this genre of movie. I mean Mr Wick is shot, stabbed with a broken bottle, punched and beaten and survives pretty much unharmed, managing to get to a Dr at the Hit-man Hotel (aka the Continental) - but when he purposely stabs himself at the end, he almost kills himself in the process.In spite of all of that, I actually really enjoyed it even if it was a bit silly. Today's action movies almost seem to be far too constructed and effects ridden, this is good old dirty beat em up action - simplistic it may be, but thoroughly enjoyable still.","

The action scenes aren't exciting, it's just Wick killing a butt load of people with little effort. There's an occasional over the shoulder move in there but this is basically an unexciting massacre. The body count had to be close to 100.I grew up with a 69 mustang so that was fun to see. And the dogs death is handled with taste.","

"JohnRayPeterson","15 January 2015","In his directorial debut (sort of- it's a collaborative effort) Chad Stahelski shows his skills. He had the experience for just this sort of action movie and delivered the goods.The script contained just the right amount of background play to set in motion the Taken, Rambo style 'you picked the wrong guy to f@ck with' adventure. Wick is a retired legendary hit man whose love for a good woman had rescued him from the dark side, that is until the dumb- ass son of a Russian mobster robbed his car and killed the only reminder of Wick's cherished wife.After 47 Ronin, I was eager to see Keanu in this type of adventure. Now admittedly the cast of this movie with the likes of Michael Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, Adrianne Palicki, John Leguizamo and Ian McShane gives it panache if I may say so.The only lovable character was the puppy, a gift from his late wife, received the day of the funeral. As another IMDb reviewer said, if someone killed my puppy under such circumstances... I'd go Boogeyman too; but who has skills like Wick.There is much collateral damage in this movie and the body-count is in the neighbourhood of 80 (78 according to one source and 84, another).On the downside, I thought Wick's resilience to gunshot wounds and knife injuries (one self inflicted, but that's complicated to explain) was a bit of a stretch.Saw several good action movies in 2014 and this late October one was entertaining, if of course you like the genre; I like most all genres.On a final note: Avoid hotels by the name of 'Continental'!","

"weatherbain-150-455883","3 November 2014","Based on the reviews I read in here, I was expecting much more from this movie. Yes the movie is action packed, but very much over done. Certainly not a quality movie by any means, with a weak story line. It was like being in an action game where the lead had unlimited lives....he is invincible no matter how many times he is shot! There are assumptions that we will understand the rules of the ""committee"", but these are never explained and we are left with very few answers the end. In light of the over the top and often excessive violence and killings, I must say Keanu Reeves' performance is the only highlight of the film. Overall however, a very weak story with unnecessary and excessive violence, and a plot that is more suited for a PlayStation game.","

"secondtake","24 November 2014","John Wick (2014)I thought the weak point of this movie would be Keanu Reeves, since he's not the best actor in town. But instead it was the monotony of the killing, on and on, all at the same pace, with hardly a break.I'm not complaining about violence hereâthat's what this kind of revenge movie is all about. Reeves plays a guy who used to be a trained assassin, one of the best, and he has to come out of retirement (you'll see why in the first ten minutes). And he is now after some of the people he once worked for, so they are formidable foes, and cruel.But that's about it. The process of getting even takes up the rest of the movie, and there are the necessary clubs and warehouses, the muscle car antics and the flipping and diving while shooting your guns with perfect accuracy. Mostly there is just shooting and fighting and fighting and shooting. So, how to make a movie that has this one-liner idea work? With psychology, cleverness, surprise, and even failure sometimes. You won't see any of that here. You also won't see humor. By luck, the preview for my showing (in a theater) was ""Die Hard,"" and what a reminder of a terrific action movie, where one guy has to kill a whole slew of enemies. But there it's funny, there are constant twists and turns, and you actually care about the hero.That's another problem here: you care about Mr. Wick because he was wronged at the start, but he's not a sympathetic person. You just don't really worry about him. I suppose you know he won't die right away, so you are ""on his side"" more or less, but not with much investment. In a weird way, some of the villains were more compelling than Wickâthe main bad guy is a terrific Michael Nyqvist (who is always really good), and Willem Dafoe plays a terrific small, key part.I might have left a movie this straight forward if it weren't for one thingâit's photographed well. The camera, light, and generally the editing, are all elegant and almost pretty, in a good way. The sets are filmed in a logical way that moves you through the spaces through the eye of the camera with confidence and dark beauty. Good stuff, and it had my eyes glued.Now give the thing something more and glue the rest of me.","

"Hellmant","29 October 2014","'JOHN WICK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Shoot-'em-up action flick starring Keanu Reeves as an ex-hit-man who comes out of retirement to avenge his dead dog. It was directed by first time feature filmmakers David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (former stuntmen and fight coordinators) and written by Derek Kolstad. The film also stars Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Dean Winters, Adrianne Palicki, Ian McShane, John Leguizamo and Willem Dafoe. It's a pretty cool and stylized action flick that's also a great comeback for Keanu Reeves.Reeves plays John Wick; a former hit-man who retired when his wife, Helen (Bridget Moynahan), became deathly ill with cancer. As he's grieving he receives a posthumous gift from her, in the form of a puppy named Daisy. It's explained, through a letter from Helen, that she wanted John to have the dog to help him cope with her passing. John quickly becomes attached to Daisy; so when Russian gang members break into his house and kill the dog, as well as steal his '69 Mustang, John decides to come out of retirement to get revenge. Nyqvist plays the father of one of the gang members, as well as John's former employer.John Wick is about as much of a badass action hero character as I've seen in a film and Reeves is great in the role. I think Reeves has gotten much better, as an actor, overtime; probably especially because his career took a pretty big downward turn recently. It's great to see him back in action and cooler than ever. I think filmmakers will do a lot more with this character as well, he's already a part of the video game 'Payday 2', and a film franchise seems very likely. The movie is also a great showcase for Leitch and Stahelski, as directors, and I can't wait to see more from them too.

It's full of action, no excessive drama, no background history asides from the fact that everyone has to be scared of John Wick just by pronouncing his name just like ""The Boogieman"". Keanu Reeves is perfect for this role, no expressions, no feelings, just a couple of lines and shooting a lot of bullets, very precisely by the way, the real acting is on the hands of Willem Dafoe (sort of). Alfie Allen is kind of on the same role as the one in Game Of Throne, sorry but I have to say it, I watched him and can't stand thinking about how he's useless here too.For an action movie I really like this one... and I'm thinking who's better John Wick or maybe Bryan Mills?","

The 'set up' was the most perfunctory excuse for what followed possible. Laughable doesn't begin to describe it. If this is what scriptwriting has become then I'm getting into it. It is just incredible. And what follows completely avoids any kind of human description - they aren't people at all. Just automatons with no discernable personalities heading towards violent oblivion or an ostensible human dishing out said violent oblivion. And I like cheesy action films. Amazing. I sent this to a friend and he thought I was being postive. Which I suppose makes sense because what I describe is, I suppose, the film's strength in some people's eyes.

"peterp-450-298716","13 February 2015","""John will come for you and you will do nothing, because you can't do nothing."" Do you hate complicated films where your brains hurt while trying to keep up with the story ?Do you start to drool spontaneously when watching endless violent action scenes? You answered twice ""Yes Sir""? Well,then ""John Wick"" is cut out for you.Because the story is simple in a way that even your goldfish can follow it easily and it it contains a concatenation of rough,cruel liquidations.I never thought that stealing a Ford Mustang and wringing the neck of a puppy could result in a never-seen,raging revenge.John Wick thought otherwise. This retired former hit-man leaves a bloody trail in New York,after they steal his car and kill his dog,donated by his deceased wife.The fact that this is committed by the son of his former boss,who's from the Russian mob, doesn't impress him.Instantly he demolishes his basement floor.Years ago,he buried his whole arsenal of weapons and other adult toys there,just to forget his past and change gear in his new life.Digging up Keanu Reeves again,certainly wasn't a bad idea.The man has a natural talent for portraying an icy cool killer.His emotionless visage is perfect for the role.And the less dialogs in a film,the better.It's not the dialogs, he has to struggle through,that gives him the appearance of a cold-blooded assassin,but his stoic calmness and the expressionless gaze does.He demonstrated this already in ""The Matrix"" and also in ""47 Ronin"" (wrongly considered by many as a pulp film).If you want to keep track of the number of victims,you should purchase a large oversize abacus.I enjoy a straightforward action film,with not to much frills and where the emphasis lies on mindless brawling and shooting.It shouldn't be serious all the time.Although after a while I felt kind of impassive about it and sank deeper into my cozy seat to watch it with such an infinite look.I compared it with a ride on a wildly popular, matchless roller-coaster.During your first ride,you feel the adrenaline rushing through your body and you rush back to the entrance full of enthusiasm just to experience that indescribable feeling once again.During the tenth drive you're sitting in it very relaxed,looking around in search for the next challenge. That's ""John Wick"" in a nutshell.A flashy roller-coaster ride that starts fiery and impressive,but as the journey takes longer,the euphoria fades away slowly.In terms of genre, it's ultimately of the same level as ""The Equalizer"". Only the latter contained a bit more story, I thought. In ""John Wick"" you have a stolen car and a dead dog on the one hand, and on the other hand an increasing number of corpses. That's it. And yet it's pure enjoyment witnessing the flashy action and shown coolness. Chad Stahelski, a former stuntman (interesting fact: he was the one who played Neo in ""The Matrix"" during dangerous scenes), doesn't beat around the bush and creates a series of precisely choreographed fight sequences. Without much effort he succeeds in giving Reeves the reputation of a Boogeyman. But as Viggo (Michael Nyqvist) remarks it himself: ""John is not exactly ""The Boogeyman"". He's the one you sent to kill the 'Boogeyman."". And this top assassin moves in a swirling way to eliminate his enemies with a well-aimed shot. His shooting technique is slightly off-track and looks somewhat forced. But that doesn't keep him from transforming the place where he appears, into an outright shooting gallery.There were some pretty surreal scenes which impressed the imagination. Like the ""Continental"" hotel, the professional cleaning team and the reputation of John Wick in itself and his cult status hovering around him as an aura. ""The Continental Hotel"" could serve as a scenic design in a future Batman movie, which bathes in a real cartoon atmosphere. It's a famous meeting point for notorious assassins, with its own monetary system, an unnaturally friendly desk clerk that meets with all the needs of the guests and a resident physician who can be called for when guests return reasonable damaged after taking care of their ""business"". There is only one golden rule which is mercilessly punished after being violated. It's prohibited to arrange matters in the hotel itself.For most of the supporting acts you can safely say that there's a total lack of character development. Most are no more than a shadow in this film, who come momentarily into view and then they're mercilessly being slaughtered. But it seems as if they are suffering from anemia, because despite the continuous aggression, there is very little blood splattered around. So only Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen (Iosef) and Willem Dafoe remain. Michael Nyqvist wasn't very convincing as Viggo and was at the times too theatrical. Alfie Allen played the well-known roll as the conceited, imagining-himself-being-untouchable son of a criminal who as he starts to realize what predator is hunting him, needs a larger size Pampers. Not that very original. And Willem Dafoe tries, but gets little screenplay to play himself into the spotlight. So Reeves is the only one to steal the show. And he does that with panache and style. Once he slips into that measured black suit and swings a duffel bag full of toys for adults in it, over his shoulder, he walks confidently towards you while the camera zooms in. And then you can brace yourself. Magnificent.""John Wick"" isn't exactly of a high level in cinematic terms but does meet the requirements of the targeted audience. A pure action movie full of spectacle. Unfortunately, there are rumors that the sequel ""John Wick"" is planned already. I admire Reeves that he's still capable to portray a character as Wick at his age of 50. He can take that kind of personage to a next level, but I'm afraid that this sequel will be a weak carbon copy from the original.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be","

"tonyhaines-spp","14 November 2014","If you took this movie back in time 30 years, it would still be a bad movie. There are two story lines here; my review of the movie and how this movie got a 7.9 IMDb rating.First the movie. There was a early moment in the theater when I thought maybe this is all a gag, a clever gag. Kinda like those mini feature spots reminding you to turn off your cell phone. They do a nice job on some of those in theater messages. Perhaps this will evolve into a Djangoesque tongue in cheek graphic novel. All this critical analysis language doesn't belong any where near John Wick. On location the actors must have looked at each other and said...really? Or maybe, my agent said we are supposed to shoot a movie today. Any movie fan with an eye for action movies will notice the poor fight scenes. I counted 6 identical fight moves straight out of the 70s cop shows on TV where somebody is flipped over using one arm and a throw. Every fight scene was the same fight. Movie audiences have evolved quite a bit since the 70s. John Wick is predictable, it's heartless, it's painfully slow with no shortage of terribly awkward dialog. I am done throwing fancy words at this mess.Now the rating. I have relied on IMDb for solid reviews for many years now. For the most part I have agreed with their rating, I could argue a half point here and there but 4-6 points? My guess is the John Wick studio has found a way to game this system. Crazy idea, right? To me it's more plausible than the plot line of the movie. Somebody at IMDb should look into this because it would be our loss if this gets out of hand.","

"klasol","17 January 2019","A man's dog is killed. So he goes out and kill 1000 men and get a new dog. That is about it. The movie is so bad, that it's a stereotype of a movie. The acting is non existing, the dialogues low and the music loud. Reeves is a great gymnast, but no actor. Defoe has expired and Nyqvist can't even fake a russian accent. This is more like a homage to video games and American V8 engines than a story. Unfortunately it netted more than 100 million dollars, I see, which explain why they will probably never give up throwing these things out in new versions for as long as the market can stomach them. I am sorry I watched it, will be more careful next time, promise.","

"DareDevilKid","21 November 2014","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 stars""John Wick"" is a rousing action thriller of the sort rarely encountered in theaters these days. The once popular genre, which was headlined by the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenegger during its heyday, has been a dying breed during the past two decades. Occasionally, a movie like ""The Raid: Redemption"" (or its bigger, better sequel, ""The Raid 2: Berandal"") comes along to satisfy fans with a penchant for R-rated violence, but the growing desire for PG- 13 action and the emergence of computer generated imaging has rendered old-school brutality obsolete. Then along comes unlikely candidate, Keanu Reeves, to ignite the flame once again. For those who crave no-holds barred action, this may be among the best the genre has to offer.On paper, the film is generic as generic gets: John Wick's (Keanu Reeves) wife dies of an unnamed disease (Bridget Moynahan plays the role, such as it is), and her final act on this world is to arrange for a beagle puppy to be sent to him. This is a beautiful, lifesaving act, and it lasts for two days, until a vile, boorish Russian named Iosef (Alfie Allen) wants to buy Wick's beautiful muscle car, and Wick isn't selling. So Iosef and his thug buddies break into Wick's home, steal his car, beat him bloody, and in a moment of pique, kill the dog. And it is this, which he later describes as the theft of the last hope he had in the whole world, that pushes him into a blood rage. John Wick, you see, is a retired assassin. And Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist), the Russian mobster who used to be Wick's employer. And those are all the ingredients we need in a film about revenge, a cool action hero, and all-out-war against the Russian mafia.There isn't much of a plot, but that's often the case with revenge- based tales. Movies of this sort aren't about narrative depth, they're about taking a hero through an increasingly difficult series of bad guys until he comes face-to-face with the Big Boss. ""John Wick's"" greatest strength is its relentless momentum. The film doesn't have a lot of down time. It offers occasional breaks, including some amusing scenes that take place in a hotel where guests aren't allowed to ""talk business."" (Breaking that rule, it turns out, can have serious consequences.) For the most part, however, ""John Wick"" knows what it is and is unapologetic about it. This is a kick-butt action film with no pretensions of being anything else. There is a short dialogue about karma and God but it's neither deep nor long.Reeves is in many ways a perfect choice for the lead. When the movie begins, Wick is in a deep funk following the death of his wife. His emotions have been shut down and remain thus for most of the film as he goes about his work. Reeves has never displayed much range; his screen presence has always been his strongest asset and it's in abundant evidence here. Wick is more of a force of nature than a fully realized character. Reeves has sufficient backstory to make him sympathetic but, thankfully, his past is murky. In fact, ""John Wick"" presents the best platform to showcase Reeves' enigmatic screen presence - there are vividly choreographed fights, a suave black suit for the hero, and no greater moral purchase on our rooting interest than that he's Keanu Reeves, and the bad guys killed his dog.The film was co-directed by former stuntmen/coordinators Chad Stahelski and David Leitch (DGA rules mandate that Stahelski be given sole official credit). They show a good understanding of how to frame a fight and never resort to the kind of rapid-fire cutting that reduces an action scene into visual confetti. The six or seven big action scenes feature a sleek, chic gusto and the shoot-outs are brutal and shot in longish takes rather than chopping them into short frames. The few one-on-one fights are well choreographed, and are neither overtly short nor do they drag on forever. There's a fantastic car chase scene too, and fortunately it doesn't look derivative from erstwhile action films and is constricted within the right time frame. Leitch and Stahelski may not be on the short list to direct the next Jane Austen adaptation. but they know their stuff when it comes to action films, and that's all that matters.""John Wick"" is the kind of ferocious B-movie fun some of us can't get enough of. Reeves, always a nimble action presence, delivers the goods and then some. Chad Stahelski - Keanu's former stunt double - and David Leitch - Brad Pitt's former stunt double - direct with a flair for movement and framing that slams you right into the fights, stabbings, and shoot-outs. From home invasion to a hotel for assassins, the stage is set for all hell to break loose, and that it does. Moral nourishment is not on the menu, but some memorable one-liners are. Juicy supporting performances from Michael Nyqvist and Alfie Allen, and terrific cameos from Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo, and Ian McShane are ample compensation in the acting department. The kick of ""Wick"" is not to be denied. It's as close to a pure adrenaline rush as you're likely to find at the moment. What else does an action movie need? Action movies are about movement, and ""John Wick"" pursues that goal with remorseless verve.The film is also wickedly funny, with a dry wit and upended expectations not only about the character himself but the underground world that sucks hims back in. ""John WicK"" is a carnivorous thriller that wonderfully displays the immeasurable depth of one man's thirst for retribution. Stylish, thrilling, and giddily kinetic, John Wick serves as a satisfying return to action for Keanu Reeves, and what looks like could be the first of an immensely entertaining franchise.","

"thechocolatebird","4 March 2015","So the whole idea of justice and epitome of first-world problems goes to the fantastic plot of invincible Kiwi Reeves who starts going all crazy killing everyone in the world over a car which he gets replaced for free and a dog he didn't really like and had around for two days. Despite the fact that the dog was a gift from his freshly dead wife, he chucked some blankets on the floor and took it off the bed. The same man who had no feelings over the dog had no feelings expressed when his best buddy got killed. Are viewers supposed to root for such a spoiled rich boy. Are viewers supposed to believe that a hit-man incapable of loving can all of a sudden switch to his cell phone video of his wife and think about her from time to time? Kiwi's character is full of contradictions like the movie for a 5 year old.","

"Rendanlovell","4 November 2014","John Wick follows Keanu Reeves a retired hit man who's wife pasted away. He receives a dog as a final gift from her. On his second day with the dog he encounters thugs who want his car. He tells them no and wakes up later that night only to be beaten senseless, his dog killed and his car stolen. And he wants revenge.Everyone knows that Keanu Reeves doesn't have the best acting range. But when a roll is prefect for him he shines. And this is exactly what happens in John Wick. The film tiptoes the fine line between being ridiculous and over the top. As much killing as Keanu does is basically to get revenge for his dog. Which is borderline stupid but Reeves really sells it. Totally investing in his character and motives. Another notable actor here is William Defoe. While I thought his character was underused he wasn't underwritten and that was a nice little thing.The world that this film creates is intriguing and brutal. As reeves travels through the criminal underworld various phrases and items are used that are totally foreign even though this is set in New York City. Characters presumably know what they mean and don't bother explaining them to you. This is for the best. Being in the dark on the little things that make the world what it is, is gripping. It makes the world feel like it's been inhabited for a long time and that sets the film apart from the majority of action flicks. As lush as the world is, shoddy camera work struggles at bringing it to life on screen. The focus seemed to be forgotten in a large number of shots. Some shots don't even seem to be focused. The action scenes look great and are void of the annoying blur but in between these tense action sequences the camera work seems amateur at best. Maybe it was just the Theater I was In I don't know. Another problem for the movie was it's ending. Well I'd go as far as to say the entire 3rd act. *SPOILERS* Not much of a spoiler as we all knew Reeves would have his revenge. But after he takes his vengeance the movie limps on for at least another half hour. Attempting to tie up loose ends was a bad call here. It feels like the film climax and then says oh crap we forgot about him! And tries to deal with that and it goes through this 3 or 4 times. This is silly to say with an hour forty minute run time but the last half hour just feel unnecessary and overlong.Overall John Wick delivers on super cool action, a surprising level of emotional, and a world that feels real. John wick is a fine piece of cinema.","

"masonsaul","16 May 2019","John Wick is honestly pretty close to perfection as far as action movies go. A tight 90(ish) minute film that takes a brutally simple and emotionally engaging plot, adds some fascinating world building and delivers some of the best action sequences Hollywood has produced in a while, all on an impressively low budget.Keanu Reeves is perfect as John Wick, fully committed to the physicality of the action scenes and as well showing John's emotional vulnerability between headshots. This all culminates in a terrific speech that confidently announces the return of one of Hollywood's best and nicest leading men.There's also a strong supporting cast here too. Willem Dafoe is effortlessly cool with an understated friendship with Reeves. Michael Nyqvist does an amazing job at showing the fear that John Wick instils in people. Finally, there's Ian McShane and John Leguizamo who are instantly likeable in their small roles.Chad Stahelski's direction is phenomenal, it puts most other Hollywood action films to shame with its endlessly impressive and always comprehensible action. It's also extremely stylish with fight scenes drenched in neon and rainfall.The music by Joel J. Richard and Tyler Bates is amazing, creating an instantly iconic main theme that's equally good at conveying the fear of John Wick as any of Michael Nyqvist's speeches. There's some needle drops here as well that really work tonally and stylistically.","

"Seraphion","3 November 2014","Enter the world of mob hit men, John Wick was the greatest the Russian mob ever had as a hired asset, dubbed not as the Boogeyman, but as the one they call to kill the Boogeyman. John then retires after finding a girl and marrying. Recently losing his wife to an illness, John receives her final gift, a dog he named Daisy, so that he can continue on loving something. One day, Iosef, the Russia mob's crown prince who don't know the mob's history, attacked John, killing Daisy and taking John's '69 Boss Mustang, after John previously denied his offer to buy the car. The Russian mob kingpin Viggo, Iosef's father, tried to negotiate with John, only for john to hang up the phone on him. John easily snuff out the hit men Victor sends at him. Viggo hires Marcus, John's old friend to kill John. Meanwhile John goes to stay at the Continental hotel, which is actually a neutral place where hit men don't kill each other. He meets old acquaintances there; Perkins and Winston, who informs him of Iosef's location. John storms the place, killing many henchmen, but Iosef slips away. When John returns to the Continental, Marcus has a clean shot opportunity at him, but he shoots a warning shot as Perkins storms into the room. John neutralizes her, extracts some info and leaves her to another 'hotel guest'. John goes and burns Viggo's money stash but then he gets caught. As Viggo leaves John for his two henchmen to kill, Marcus snipes one of them and John takes care of the other. He then storms at Viggo but he lets Viggo live after he tells him Iosef's location. John storms the place and quickly kills Iosef. Viggo doesn't stand still and has Perkins kill Marcus for not killing John when he had the chance. The Continental's 'management' goes to Marcus's place and execute Perkins for breaking the Continental's rule. They also inform John of Viggo's location. John storms the place, impeding Viggo's run. John and Viggo have a final fight where John intentionally lets himself get stabbed by Viggo only to lock his arm, retake the knife and jam it to Viggo's neck. John then gets another dog from a dog shelter.Okay, I admit the story feels like a lame choice for a movie. For me personally, it even gets to feel like a guilty pleasure. There's no real invention at the story; a hard boiled killer going out his retirement to exact revenge. There's really nothing new added to this movie. It's even so very predictable in how the story unravels itself. All the elements of a classic ninety-minute revenge action movie is there; the cause, the conflict, the hunt, and the target escaping once or twice before the final showdown.Yet I find that this movie really knows what other elements to maximize to compensate for the mediocre story. It nicely grasp the dramatization of the revenge cause as a sad story but also simultaneously as funny. I really like the screenplay and dialog emphasize this on the way Aurelio explains his story and Viggo's reaction early on. The dialog on that part is a superb piece that cracked my laugh. But then it gets back to serious as we see John stroking the dead Daisy's head.The action is also a strong point in this movie, possibly even it's strongest point. Unlike typical action movies, this movie doesn't offer realistic tactical firefights as the most of the shootings happen in up and close point blank range. There's also less of beautifully choreographed martial arts trade of moves as the fights quickly turn into ground grappling moves which is the most realistic choice to go in the real world. Instead at times the character John Wick presents us with quite a combination of gun shooting and fighting, making him look like he's doing a hard and stylish action of 'gun dance'.The acting is just a decent overall work for me. Keanu Reeves did great in portraying the calm hit man exacting his revenge. Michael Nyqvist did quite well in portraying a balance of all the aspects of Viggo's character; the ruthlessness and also the cowardice. Having Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo also did the movie a great favor, although I think that they deserve even more significant parts.John Wick (2014) really deserves an 8 out of 10 score for me. A recommendation is definitely a yes. Although without any unique thing to offer in the story department, this movie can sure make up for it at the action side, and making the early irony something fun to watch.","

"vizkty","19 January 2015","Interesting action movie. What i really liked about it is that lack or normal exaggerations in the movie continuity. John does NOT shoot 100 bullets from a handgun without reloading, he does NOT fight for 20 minutes with the bad guy at the end and he does NOT have superhuman powers (like flying through windows, dodge bullets or fall from 50 meters without repercussions). Yes, it's a bit brutal (90% of the guys get shot in the head), but it's exactly what i would expect in real life if a person like Wick would really exist and would go rogue. Besides that, some clichÃ©s, some cars miraculously exploding (i think the only thing which was really amateurish made in the script) and the normal lack of story in a bang-bang-shoot-don't-look movie. But, at least Wick goes after the bad guys for killing his dog, not the woman he loved (like in most of the others). Overall, 9/10 to watch, 4/10 to watch again.","

If you didn't like Jack Reacher but still like action movies, you will like this.This movie belongs in the greats for male character development, right up there with Crank and Riddick, but somewhere below Army of Darkness, Gladiator, Rambo, and Die Hard.

"The-Sarkologist","19 May 2017","All I can say is woah, absolutely brilliant. I never expected a hit man movie to be this awesome. In fact I am surprised that I completely missed this movie and the only reason that I decided to watch it was because the poster for the sequel was just awesome. Okay, maybe one shouldn't judge a movie by its poster, but unfortunately I happen to be one of those people that get completely suckered in by a really cool poster. However after watching this film I'm not really all that convinced that the sequel is going to be anywhere near as awesome as this film I have to admit that I have always been attracted to 'Hitman movies' though as it turns out pretty much every hit-man movie that I have watched has ended up being little more than rubbish. That is until I saw this movie which left me absolutely gobsmacked. Almost every aspect of this movie was brilliant that it pretty much grabbed me right from the beginning and dragged me in right until the end. That is one amazing thing about this film, and that was that it ended really, really well, and even had quite a number of interesting twists in it that left me breathless.John Wick is a hit-man, though he has since got out of the game. However his wife dies of cancer but her parting gift is a little puppy dog. One day, a couple of days after her funeral, this guy decides he wants his car so he breaks into his house, kills his dog, and steals the car. Well, it turns out to be a really big mistake. Mind you, this kid happens to be the son of the head of the Russian mafia, but that doesn't phase John Wick one bit because he used to work for the Russian mafia, and he was really, really good at what he did. This is why the Russian mafia attempts, and fails abysmally, and getting rid of him first.One of the really cool things about this film is that within a short space of time it creates this world in which John Wick inhabits, and it is a world where things don't always go according to plan. It is a world of shifting alliances, and friendships that allow people to control their destiny. Even though Wick is the protagonist, he doesn't kill all of the antagonists because this world that has been created actually does a really, really good job of dealing with these problems in a realistic manner. Further, not everybody dies, which also adds to the awesomeness of the film.This is an action movie, pure and simply. Honestly, I really don't know why anybody would have expected anything along the lines of The Godfather â it was never meant to be as such. It is its own film set in its own world with its own laws. It is a film where you can walk through the streets of New York with a machine gun, and a world where the police, who know who you are, will turn a blind eye to what is in effect a mass murder. In the end it is one awesome wild wide and if you love a good old fashioned action film then you will simply not be disappointed â especially since it comes down to the fact that they killed his dog.","

"spasek","17 November 2018","John Wick is a movie that has all of the action trademarks that actions fans desire, and then some. There isn't anything that we haven't seen before, and it's another film that has borrowed heavily from the Bourne franchise; action sequences shown in quick-cuts and fast movements to give the audience the feel of a tense, frenetic pace.However, movies like this that truly work have a decent story and their characters are intelligent as well as efficient. Jason Bourne, for instance, is methodical, and he's always five steps ahead of everyone else. Leon, from The Professional, isn't a smart man generally, but he's cold, merciless, and efficient when he kills, as any true killer would be. Robert McCall also demonstrates tremendous intelligence.There are too many inconsistencies in this film. John Wick is supposed to be, according to his friends and enemies alike, the coldest, most efficient killing machine around. And yet, there are too many instances where we quickly begin to doubt the veracity of that claim. Oh, he can kill. No doubt, but he's not very good at predicting and anticipating what's coming. He lacks the intelligence of the above-mentioned characters. The characterization is inconsistent and filled with too many contradictions.Someone like John Wick would never let a female assassin, who was trying to kill him, live. He would have put her down. He also would never have been lying on his bed, making himself a target.Here, also, is a man who can hit moving targets as easy as pie, even effectively shooting them while driving a car. And yet, he's unable to shoot a running target in a nightclub...getting off about five or six shots...all of them missing.Wick also has a ""guardian angel"" who saves him from certain death a couple of times, which also lends itself to proving that Wick isn't as bright as he would be.If you're going to be a good writer, you have to stick to the plot points and abilities of your character. Contrived plot points show a weakness in your story-telling. You have to use your brain to come up with a plausible reason why Wick's target was able to elude him. This one fails miserably.Keanu Reeves still can't act his way out of a paper bag. He can only deliver lines one way, and it just doesn't work most of the time with this character. He's most effective when he isn't saying anything. When he does talk, his lines are said in a way to make them almost laughable.Still, the movie isn't a complete failure. The supporting cast does enough to help keep the film from drowning in its own inconsistencies.As a number of reviewers have stated, if you just want mindless action, John Wick works pretty well. If you want action with substance, and characters who are more believable, then you're better off watching movies with the above-mentioned characters.Given that most viewers today don't care for anything with a good story or characterizations, I can see why this film was such a hit.","

"3xHCCH","4 November 2014","The career of Keanu Reeves seemed to have taken a nosedive after the success of the Matrix films. We would be hard put to name even one film after that. Last year, he directed a martial arts film called Man of Tai Chi, where he played antagonist to a less than charismatic leading man. That did not fly too high, except perhaps for some hardcore action fans. For this year though, the buzz for this film ""John Wick"" was simply too high to ignore. The plot is ripped off the plots of many other old-fashioned action films, especially those from the 1980s. JOhn Wick is a retired hit man. He is still very depressed about his wife's death. One day, a group of thugs break into John's house and destroy his wife's one most precious gift to him. John finds out the perpetrator Iosef is the crazy spoiled son of his old boss, Viggo. John then goes on a deadly revenge rampage until no one is left alive.Yes, there is not much about that script to be excited about. However, for their first directorial effort, David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, the stunt coordinators for Keanu Reeves in ""Matrix"", make a spectacular debut. Their action sequences were fast-clipped, very exciting and relentlessly brutal. Be it gunplay, knife-play or martial arts, Keanu Reeves made a perfect action hero.A lot of this film's success also comes because of Reeves' excellence in dramatic acting. Okay, so there only few of those moments. We will remember fondly his devotion to his wife, which Reeves was able to project very well without words. He was sincerely in those touching scenes.","

John Wick is a deadly character not to be messed with and Keanu embodies him perfectly. He has a short and simple story, but gets to the point with good action scenes. A pretty cool crime movie that brought Keanu back as a great action icon. It's quite an entertaining movie that boasts convincing performances and a good soundtrack.

"Al_The_Strange","30 November 2014","If it's one thing action movies can teach us, it's that you don't mess with people who have nothing left to lose. John Wick hinges on the simple premise of a retired hit-man who plows through the Russian mafia and leaves a mile-long body trail, all because they killed his puppy. And stole his ride. Somebody has to pay! As silly this may sound, the film plays it all with a straight face, and it works because there is a good amount of heart to the setup. In the opening scenes, we see that this is more than the story of a man, his car, and his dog; it's the story of a loss and betrayal. Once the appropriate pathos is established, John Wick rises as the tough and skilled action hero we can root for. It doesn't take long for the butt-kicking to commence, but once it does, it's densely-packed, fast-paced, relentlessly-brutal, and very well-executed. Whether shooting, punching, stabbing, or running bad guys over, it is quite a rush to watch Wick descend into the criminal underworld and find payback.As exciting and stylish as the film is, what really keeps it from falling into mediocrity is the title character. The film successfully evokes sympathy for Wick - the man who lost his wife, before losing everything else - and it provides a solid reasoning for why we should care about whether or not Wick succeeds. As the film goes on, Wick's journey takes him through a bizarre criminal world with its own set of rules, codes, and even currency. It turns out that it's a world Wick is already familiar with, and he has a history with most of the minor characters that pop up. Thus, the film unearths stark themes of how the past, present, and future are entwined.This film is well-shot, with great-looking photography and editing. It is especially refreshing that the action scenes are solid and steady, with no fast-cutting or camera shake. I also think the color schemes and nighttime cityscapes lend the film a dark and grimy type of neo-noir appeal. Acting is fine for what it is; you may not think much of Keanu Reeves, but this film is proof that the man can act. His portrayal of John Wick is quite spot-on. And he can kick a lot of butt very impressively. Writing is not the best, but it gets the job done. This production has pretty good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music choices, and the music score, feature really heavy beats and hard rock cues, and I found it awesome that way.John Wick, much like A Bittersweet Life, is a dark crime movie with lots of action, but also a lot of emotional backing behind its characters. It's a simple story that's told well and features plenty of satisfying setpieces. Recommended for at least one viewing.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)","

"lesuchan-desu","15 December 2014","I know it is too late to warn you not to go see this movie. But still, I am writing this review to express my disappointment, and to say I have no idea why this movie can be rate 7+ here. There must be something wrong.I am a big fan of Keanu. And I do not mind action movie with simple plot, as long as it looks cool. Nevertheless, I was brought down big time. The plot is unbelievably ridiculous. It will leave you amazed, wondering if whether someone pro-read the script before they made it a movie. No twist, no surprise, no character development, nothing thrilling or exciting whatsoever. It is utter boredom. I felt intelligently insulted, to be honest. And the action does not look cool either. Seriously, if you expect something like, let's say, Taken, you will be massively disappointed. John Wick does not really fight. He shots randomly, move randomly, and grunts, and moans. Nothing else. Everything cool about him is what you heard the others say before the fighting starts.I hope this review can actually reach someone, and help to stop them from wasting their time watching this movie. I genuinely do.","

"Hitchcoc","16 November 2019","Since the plot is so lacking in substance (the old, you killed my wife and my dog bit), we must look to other things to find positive. First of all, Keanu Reeves is pretty good on screen, and plays an interesting avenger. The bad guys seem to have an endless supply of stupid employees who allow their heads to be blown off. Sounds stupid? But the directing and movement of the characters during the incredibly long scenes of destruction are quite amazing. It's sort of a Kill Bill thing. Anyway, it is engaging. I did like that cast. The kid that was in Game of Thrones (who was eviscerated in that show) was a nice foil for Wick. We also have the fellow who is Mayhem in the insurance commercials. Of course, there are enough loose ends for the sequels (which number two at this point). I probably won't bother if they just have more of the same. Put an actual plot in there and you would have a bit of balance.","

"ixtlan","27 December 2015","That was one of the all-time worst movies I have ever seen. And a sequel is coming out in 2016? That adds insult to injury. So many things in this movie just do not make sense: Here are just a few:1. Vigo and Iosef are right: It was just a car and a dog. Now I am an animal lover but the fate of the dog does not justify in any universe the wanton destruction of dozens of people brutally murdered and in public places.2. A real Vigo would have killed him and never let Wick go after his son. After spending all that time and money to prevent his own and son's murder? His actions when he catches Wick make no sense. Just off him. Oh yeah then the rest of the movie can't happen.3. Kill a priest in front of his church in broad daylight? Rubbish.4. Suddenly Vigo is no longer afraid of Wick?5. Marcus has no reason to set up his expensive equipment and elaborate stake outs to not kill Wick.6. A hotel that is so out in the open about being a hotel for gangsters? Really? And men dripping blood show up at expensive hotels all the time?7. A hotel that has a doctor whose stitches and staples gangster wounds for a living?So unbelievably disappointing I just want to blame someone - and get my money back. But alas, I only have myself to blame for sitting through it.","

"destroyerwod","4 November 2014","This movie truly feel like returning back in time, but with today's technology and style. It had a mix of Commando for the ""one man army"" set-up but without the one liners and corny style. Keanu Reeves/John Wick definitely succeed at being both a bad-ass character, but somebody that you truly feel for.I was reading other reviews and one point that stand out also to me is even tough the movie is fast to start, there ain't too much build up, you still care a lot for that man. When the dog is kill, despite the short time he spent with it, i still felt his pain and grief. The guy had nothing left beside a dog and a car, and they took it from him.So yeah this movie is just pure old school greatness, like you don't see many these days. There is even a small role for Bloodsport's Daniel Bernhardt which was also in The Matrix Reloaded, and there first fight is extremely satisfying.The movie include lots of gunfights, a fair amount of hand to hand combat, some car chases scene, and pretty much everything you expect from an action movie, its really a great time.","

"ydnar123","19 February 2015","John Wick is an instant classic action film. It doesn't have a crazy plot that makes it easy to get lost its just basic. You don't have to wait long for the action to begin and when it starts it goes pretty much right through to the end. I really hope that this is the beginning of a franchise because it certainly looks that way. I hope this film gets some attention because I didn't hear much talk about it and its run in the theater went by fairly quietly (although it did make 50 million bucks of profit). It also great to see Keanu Reeves find a role that seems to spark a comeback for him. Keanu has been a huge action star for over 20 years and its nice to see him back on top. John Wick may become one of his significant roles in the future.","

Over-the-top yet a guilty pleasure revenge action flick with Reeves (in arguably his finest role since THE MATRIX) as the titular lethal assassin in retirement who finds himself shoved back into his old ways when the punk son of a former associate Russian mobster (Nyqvist in oily mode) who steals his prized '69 Mustang and kills his puppy - a gift from his recently deceased, beloved wife (Moynahan). Hell bent on getting revenge Wick is laser focused on his prime initiative with a wake of destruction and a huge body count while being contracted for his own hit in the process. Newbie director Chad Stahelski (a veteran stuntman who collaborated with Reeves on THE MATRIX films among others) shows his chops in the carefully executed non-stop fight/shoot sequences with aplomb and enabled with a rogues gallery of veteran character actors peppered out makes up for the somewhat graphic novel trappings of the film border lining pulp cartoon ridiculousness from the anything goes script by novice Derek Kolstad but keeps things brutally lively.","

This is the type of movie people will see over and over again. Waited in a long line to see it but it was well worth it. Amazing special effects, great acting, great everything. Best movie I have seen all year. Keanu Reeves is back after a long break and he is better than ever. This is like a combination of Speed and the Matrix combined. Directors Leitch and Stahelski have created a beautiful looking action picture, one that is large enough to deserve the IMAX experience.John Wick is the real deal. It is a amazing action picture, filled with strong performances by a cast, along with superb action set-pieces and a genuinely interesting world to boot. Reeves commands the screen and reminds us why he is still a genuine movie star.","

"Spartan_1_1_7","16 January 2015","Keanu Reeves is back, HELL YEAH!!John Wick is a movie about, well, John Wick, a normal guy whose wife recently died and her dying gift to him was a dog. Theon the d**k less a**hole from Game of thrones was being his usual d**k self in this movie and decides to kill John wick's dog and steal his sweet ass mustang. Little did he know that John wick wasn't just some normal guy. And we get our revenge action movie. You don't kill someone's dog and steal their ride, you just don't. While many people might find the plot stupid or something, let me tell you, there is a lot more to it than a simple revenge tale. The movie knows what it is and executes it perfectly. But underneath all that revenge, there is some really cool world building going on. There are these rules, managements, neutral zones etc, which push John Wick from being just a simple brainless revenge movie. I hope they make sequels to it as there is A LOT of potential for this become an awesome franchise. Coming back to Keanu Reeves, HOLY S***, he was awesome in this movie. Being a Keanu Reeves fan, it is so great to see him finally get a role where he can shine again. The dude kills it as John Wick. He is cool, he is sleek and he is a total Bada**. Hell, he might give Liam Neeson and Matt Damon a run for their money. :p You appreciate him even more knowing that he did 90% of the stunts in this movie. Because of that, the action scenes consisted of long takes instead of the usual quick cuts we see in Hollywood movies and made the action SO MUCH BETTER. Couple that with good cinematography, slick and sleek directing and pumping soundtrack, and you get yourself an awesome RARE action movie. Another thing this movie did well was that even though John Wick is shown to be one of the best or THE BEST in his work, he is not invincible or immortal, at the end, he is a human. Many similar movies forget this point and make their heroes way TOO good that it takes you out of the experience. I really really hope this movie does well enough on the box office that we get a sequel from the same team. Highly recommended if you are looking for an action movie or are a Keanu Reeves fan. 8.5/10","

"petra_ste","3 September 2015","Although I will never forgive Keanu Reeves for ruining Coppola's Dracula with a legendary terrible performance, he is not an inherently bad actor. Like a well-honed tool , Keanu is fine if put in the right place; if misplaced (say, as a 19th century upper-class Englishman), he is disastrous. Here Keanu is ideally cast as titular assassin John Wick; the part exploits his wiry physicality and doesn't stretch his limited range, requiring him to project deadly efficiency as he slaughters Russian mobsters who killed his dog. The latter may sound stupid but it's actually the smartest decision in the movie, as it places the story firmly in comic book territory, which fits the hyper-stylized violence seen here. The script also features a few clever touches, like golden coins used as currency for special services in the criminal underworld (such as corpse disposal) or a hotel known as a truce zone for killers; again, an appropriate comic book feel.Director Stahelski uses his experience as stunt coordinator to craft energetic set-pieces, peaking in Wick's attack to an underground pool. There is a great moment when the camera pans laterally showing the silhouette of a mobster shot against a blue panel, then follows another thug until Wick takes him down, all while the music throbs in the background.The cast also includes Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, Adrianne Palicki and Michael Nyqvist; the latter steals the movie with a combination of sharp malevolence and detached sense of humor, like when he recalls Wick killing three men with a pencil then walks next to one of his henchmen and casually mimics a stab at his throat.As far as revenge/power fantasies go, this one at least is competently made.6,5/10","

"stephenlovelette","13 November 2014","I'm done marginalizing film tastes in terms of genderÂÂis originally how I began this review.Yet it's the antithesis of my gut response to John Wick:""Highly recommend for mainly male moviegoers,"" my heart mentions as the credits roll.The cranium cogs start whirling.""Isn't that rhetoric unproductive? Shouldn't we discourage that type of thinking?"" my intellectual side fires back.Thus prompting the rough introduction.While reviewing J. Wick on The Screen Rant Underground, two of the hosts offer a counterargument in mentioning their wives' dislike. One goes so far as to say she 'hated it.'(Side Note: The words 'hate' and 'boring' are the two most overused descriptors in the English language.)'Violence' and 'Romance' occupy the extremities of the gender Venn diagram.Men prefer fighting; women prefer feeling. Simple as that, folks.""It's a social construct! The best movies lie in the diagram's center! To mention the pattern is to perpetuate it!"" the brain chimes in.The inescapable reality is: The paradigm exists.Whether I like it or not.To put an untidy bow on my point: Isn't it stilted claiming a movie is excellent (better than great), but for male audiences only? Doesn't that imply John Wick is terrible, if viewed by a female audience?Surely there are women who enjoy gun-fu. Shouldn't they feel insulted by the suggestion?Anyhow; you catch my drift.Here's my Top Five Movies with the Protagonist's Full Name as the Title â1. Donnie Darko 2. Annie Hall 3. Forrest Gump 4. Happy Gilmore 5. Billy MadisonJohn Wick is similar to Denzel Washington's character from last month's The Equalizer.Both protagonists are similar to Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher, who is also an ex-CIA agent.Say what you will about his surfing abilities in Point Break, Keanu Reeves is terrific as the leading hombre.Keanu's John's less virtuous, and less lady-magnet than Tom's Jack, but they both can drive in reverse like champions.Which marks the first of three lessons I learned from J.W. about firearms.Lesson 1) If you must drive at enemy gunfire, do so in reverse.Keanu's acting is great. Soft-spoken and pragmatic; sympathy sits with him quite nicely.Plus he does all his own fighting and stunts.In the hand-to-hand combat; the viewer can tell he's absorbing all the blows. He falls off a balcony!Keanu's just terrific.The action scenes are phenomenal.Throughout the entire film, the epic fight sequences rival the best in cinematic history.The gunplay is realistic and grounded. You've never seen such concrete shootouts.Lesson 2) Due to recoil, hand-held assault rifles can only be fired in bursts.Wick manages to dispatch a number of thugs in an organic fashion.It especially illustrates the possibilities for less cutting, and more believable action in the film industry.Lesson 3) Those who wield a pistol at the ready (like a cop entering the home of a serial killer) live longest.The stuntwork is absolutely spectacular; far too much fiddling with convention to mention.During an explosion, there is an actual stuntman in the foreground nearby the exploding material.He catches fire! It's awesome!Who doesn't love John Leguizamo? Talk about reliable.Alfie Allen catches critical heat for playing a similar role on Game of Thrones, which is unnecessary. He does a fine job for what he's cast as.Good to see WCW's Kevin Nash playing a small part.Ian McShane is terrific as always. Somebody's not paying him enough.Willem DeFoe plays a man who serves vegetable puree rather than booze at a meeting of criminal wits. Yet another shiny bullet on DeFoe's lengthy list.Adrianne Palicki plays a solid murderess.Ironically enough, the only time I was 'taken out of' the movie is during footage of her stunt double.Finally, the off-type villain is performed excellently by Michael Nyqvist.John Wick may be the poster-child for breaking clichÃ©; which is shaping up to be the number one theme for cinema 2014.Catch it in IMAX while it's still in theaters.There's no stinger after the credits roll.But hey. I'd be down for a sequel.","

"lathe-of-heaven","1 February 2015","That basically was the primary thought echoing through my mind during the end credits. Seriously... EVERYBODY has to be so damn tough... EVERYBODY has to revenge bloody EVERYTHING... I'm talking about the bad guys here... Not to give anything away, but they REALLY set you up fully to expect and enjoy the revenge that has truly been earned by these fools.Sorry to go off like that, but although necessary and ultimately entertaining, it is still SO bloody frustrating from a strictly intellectual point of view, that these stubborn Evil @ssholes Never EVER know when to quit! GEEZ... Well, clearly giving it a rating of '8', I really did like the film. Most entertaining. VERY reminiscent of the minimalist Clint Eastwood 'Man with No Name' films. But, brought up to date.The story is simple and with so many reviews, there is no need to go into it more here; but watching the film I got the strong impression almost like I was watching a video game. And, I mean that in a good way. The action was SO smooth and choreographed. This is STRICTLY Revenge / Action entertainment people; and VERY good entertainment at that if you enjoy revenge tales. But, don't expect Mamet or Shakespeare here; that is just not the point of this film.That's basically it; I don't know why I am writing a review when there are nearly 500 already (normally I don't) but, since I had such a frigg'n BLAST watching this, I just wanted to weigh in as saying that it is LOTS of fun and very well done. Keanu is absolutely perfect for it, despite your opinion of him. If you like a good, Action / Revenge Thriller, then you probably will really enjoy this. It's not overly deep or over the top violence wise. It just does exactly what it is supposed to do, and does it beautifully...","

"quincytheodore","2 November 2014","The One has been stylishly resurrected from depth of obscurity. It's a crucial requirement for hit men to have a mediocre first name and quirky last name, as seen with Bond or Bourne, by this standard, John Wick has secured himself in pantheon of action heroes. His tale follows the known formula of one assassin returning to his old life, but what makes John Wick stands out is how vibrant and exciting the movie portrays him. From the nuance, visual and audio, everything looks like enhanced virtual reality or a very polished video game.Keanu Reeves, despite having impressive resume, might not be the most dynamic actor. He doesn't transform himself in every role, like say, Tom Cruise. However, with good direction and material, both are present in this movie, he will perform amazingly. This is one of Reeves' best roles aside from his in Matrix and Speed, he brings the air of confidence along with hidden yet excessive violence. Reeves display a good emotion as the character, and he also moves with certainty like a hit-man would. There is expert use of close quarter combat technique with multitude of fire arms and knowledge of martial arts for the foundation of the character. Although it is heavily brimmed with action elements, John Wick is also equipped with a bit of emotional baggage. From ancient time, the loss of loved one is an acceptable motive for incoming rampage.The movie is exhibited with flair, its use of color is simply impressive. Every set piece is done with meticulous vivid visual. The camera angle makes it as though the world of John Wick is seen in different light, almost in the setting of enhanced modern noir. Each action is choreographed meticulously and it's a paramount aspect to make him believable as a lethal force. One of the best things about the action is how the fast pace can be captured with precision. Oftentimes movie employs shaky camera or highly uncoordinated editing. This movie manages to display action with clear focus and crisp movements, even at more crowded setting it never relents or overload the viewer with too much visual information.Soundtracks help a lot with solemn tone and faster techno rhythm. It's probably one of the best soundtracks of this year, rivaling Hans Zimmerman's from The Amazing Spider-Man 2. There are not many action movies with this high of production value, it certainly packs enough fiery punch to leave a scorch mark for sequel, I won't be surprised if there's even a video game of it. With no Bond, Hunt or Bourne in sight, this may be the time for John Wick.","

"MovieWarfare","26 May 2023","Who would've thought a movie about someone taking revenge for their dog, would lead to one of the best action franchises of all time?Rewatching the first one after all this time, John Wick isn't as badass here as he is in later entries. He survives a lot because the antagonist don't simply kill him or because his friend saves him. It also ends weirdly with a one on one fight with an old man.Nevertheless, it is still a terrific action movie with memorable action sequences such as the house and the club shoot-out. Keanu was also a great casting choice!This should be a template for how to make a great action movie!","

"stevendbeard","24 October 2014","I saw ""John Wick"", starring Keanu Reeves-the Matrix movies, Speed; Michael Nyqvist-Mission:Impossible_Ghost Protocol, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_2009, Willem Dafoe-The Fault in Our Stars, John Carter and Adrianne Palicki-G.I.Joe:Retaliation, Red Dawn_2012.If you like action movies, then you should love this one-I did. It's directed by a couple of newcomers, David Leitch & Chad Stahelski, who have worked as stunt men on the Matrix movies with Keanu. Keanu plays a retired assassin-yeah,like they can ever just retire-that gets married, then his wife dies and then he gets sucked back into the business. His nickname when he was working was The Boogeyman. Michael plays a Russian mob boss that has a stupid son; his son steals Keanu's car and kills Keanu's dog-see? stupid. I know, the plot sounds like it could be a great country music song; He looses his wife, he looses his car and then he looses his dog. But the plot is not the best part of this movie. It's the action. The fights are incredible, as well as the gun play. Willem plays a former associate to Keanu-he used to give Keanu his assignments, back before he retired and Adrianne plays a fellow assassin, that wants in on the action. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and drug use and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.","

"vistheindian","23 November 2014","Quickie Review:John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is a highly skilled ex-hit-man who receives a puppy from his dying wife to help him grieve. Things only get worse when a spoiled son of a crime boss steals John's car and murders his puppy. Now he must return to the criminal world he had left years ago to avenge all that he has lost. You have heard and seen this type of plot countless times, there are no surprises here, you will predict everything. But is it fun? Oh yes it is. Keanu owns his role and is a complete badass. So despite the unoriginality of the plot, John Wick is filled with some of the most original gunfights I've seen in a long time. Overall this movie is an entertaining pop-corn action flick that is well worth your time.Full Review:I think most would agree that Keanu Reeves is no thespian when it comes to his acting talents. So even though he has been in some terrible movies lately I still find to be a likable actor. I just want him to return to his glory days of being Neo, and John Wick seemed like the perfect opportunity for him to do that, so I was more than I excited to see it.Let's be real here, this movie could have come off very cheesy judging by its premise. However, Keanu through his action persona sold me on this seemingly odd world and character as being real and actually quite cool. You can see Reeves wholeheartedly dedicating himself to his role that you can't help but cheer him on for every brain splattering headshot (strange thing to cheer I know, but you'll know what I mean). Most importantly, this is an action film that actually shows the action. From what I can remember there was not a single shaky cam, every gun fight is brilliantly shot (pun intended) beginning to end. I also loved how precise the movements were, John Wick would always land a headshot and if he can't then he would shoot another part of the body to get an aim at the head. Just plain awesomeness.John Wick is not without its problems. As I mentioned before the plot is largely unoriginal, so whenever there are no fights the movie is not as engaging. Also I was quite underwhelmed by the climatic end. The rest of the movie had a great build in tension but the finale felt rushed, and left more to be desired. One of the positives of John Wick is the rich criminal underworld. It is filled with colorful characters and has very interesting ways in which it functions. There is a sense of mutual respect amongst the people in that world. I just wish we got to explore more of that world because I found it to be so intriguing and unique. I am sure they will if there ever is a sequel, which I do think this movie deserves.In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed my time watching John Wick. Yes it has some flaws, but I was able look past them to appreciate it for what it is. One word to sum up the movie would be ""personality,"" because even if it is working with tired story and character concepts John Wick does it with style and fun.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/","

"JackRJosie","4 September 2023","Unfortunately I do not understand the appeal of this film. Why has John Wick become such a social rave? I'll tell you why- because John Wick is cool and shoots guys good! No but seriously what is it about this film?! There is nothing ""good"" about it. The only thing it has going for it is it's action and quite frankly the action is boring- point and shoot.The premise of this film can be surmised in a sentence. Mans wife dies, but leaves him a dog, bad guys kill dog, man kills bad guy. Okay so that was a run on sentence but you get the point. The whole plot revolves around the first 5 minutes of the film!!!There is absolutely no emotional attachment to john wicks wife, nor his dog. Simply because no time was spent developing those relationships.The hour and a half of shooting is not driven by a compelling plot device, it is simply driven by action. Action driving action.Correction: bad action driving bad action.Mindless filmmaking.Also did a 3 year old monkey color grade this film? Tis not pleasing to the eye at all. It all feels so fake.Why oh why is this flick so popular?Oh yes. Because Keanu Reeves is a Bad-A! Do you know what that stands for? BAD ACTOR!I've seen worse. It's watchable and fun.","

"Cineanalyst","2 August 2021","It's not about a puppy. That's not the essence of the ""John Wick"" revenge myth. It's an abstraction; the wife wrote as much in the attached note with the gifted pet. The dog was all he had left of his late wife. Much like some obtuse entertainment critics, the mobsters don't grasp this concept. There's a bit of a pun at the center of all of this, too, for the word ""underworld,"" which relates to both the world of Russian gangsters and assassins and the afterlife in Greco-Roman mythology--plus New York. That the hotel concierge is named Charon, after the Hades psychopomp, and collects the gold-coin equivalent of obols rather gives it away. Thus, the canine represents the dead wife, John Wick is Orpheus--the action movie equivalent of a poet playing music and dancing with gun-fu--and he descends to, turns back to, the underworld in the vein of seeing or resurrecting his wife. Note the ending--part of which is also at the beginning--in this respect. It adds up, including seeing his wife via our technology of ghosts, motion pictures--the video on his phone. Neat, too, that the beginning frames the narrative as a sort of dream, as he collapses and closes his eyes, and we're not sure whether he's dead, unconscious or asleep, but regardless what follows is the memory, or revenge fantasy, of the events leading up to that point.""Orpheus and Eurydice"" seems to be the primary myth here, which may be surprisingly a common one in cinema. Personally, I prefer, for instance, the one with lesbians, ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019), despite the absence of weaponry and automobiles, and there's also Jean Cocteau's Orphic trilogy and ""Black Orpheus"" (1959), among others. But, at least a couple other character names here suggest other myths. The wife is named Helen, as of Troy, whose death, to paraphrase Homer, launched the god of war (or devilish boogeyman) upon a thousand ships. Moreover, the name of John's friend Marcus suggests his devotion to that god of war, Mars. And, make what you will of the role of the Orthodox church as a bank lit ablaze, in the underworld.This is better than I thought it'd be, ""John Wick"" already being quite the famous movie that I thought I already had a fair assumption of a relatively unsophisticated shoot-'em-up, although it is that, too, to an extent. It's good to know what so many recent stylized brawling, gun pornos are cribbing these days. ""Atomic Blonde"" (2017), ""Hotel Artemis"" (2018), ""Polar"" (2019), ""Ava"" (2020), ""Nobody"" ""Gunpowder Milkshake"" (both 2021) are some of the claimed copycats in the wake of writer Derek Kolstad and directors Chad Staheiski and David Leitch's franchise. Not that ""John Wick"" owns a patent on any of this; indeed, it was released around the same time as twin film ""The Equalizer"" (2014), and the plot is reminiscent of ""Road to Perdition"" (2002), but some of the imitations are extremely blatant. The latter two released recently in 2021, one of which was also written by Kolstad, especially so. No secret is made of action-movie trends, particularly from the East--Hong Kong, Korea, Taiwan--that inspired it, or Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns, or the root of all that in Akira Kurosawa samurai films. Most interesting methinks (maybe because some of my fondest memories of college involve classes on both subjects), though, in addition to the ancient-to-classical mythology, is the other significant genre this emulates, noir.It's not just the dark neon-noir look, although (some fairly standard color grading aside--lots of blue and a bit of orange and teal when its sunny--the usual) the commitment here is appreciated, especially that disco-slash-bathhouse, first, for being a disco and a bathhouse, and, second, for keeping the music and rave strobe lights going during a blood bath. Some of it has a comic-book or graphic-novel appearance, too, including those subtitles. But, it's also impressive how compatible are the mythology and noir, both fitting the trajectory of an oppressive, fated tragedy and the return of past demons. Both are otherworldly. We also get some of the more specific conventions or tropes of the genre. There's a bit of a femme fatale, who, indeed, complicates matters for John later on. The wake up calls, both land line and cellular. Plenty of drinking and smoking to go with the violence, of course. And, there's the soul-cleansing rain--seen both at the funeral and in the climactic showdown, as well as the tattoo-showing-off shower.Of course, one may just enjoy ""John Wick"" for the spectacular, well-shot fight choreography--and in some great locations. Besides the disco and the Continental, I also like those windows in Wick's home and the general suburban-to-urban dichotomy of the descent to the underworld. Keanu Reeves is in peak form, as well. Another case here of oft imitated but seldom equaled.","

"matthewssilverhammer","1 November 2014","John Wick is a lot of things. It's an action thriller that starts with a jarring bang and never lets up. It's a modern-day western over-run by black hats. It's Refn's Drive, only faster, louder, funnier, and wilder. It's punchy and smooth, tough and violent, and refreshingly brash. It's also relatively straight-forward and by-the-numbersÂbut if you're gonna make a straight-forward, by-the numbers revenge thriller, take note: this is how you do it with hutzpah. Reeves plays a grieving husband whose wife, as her dying action, gets him a puppy to cope with the loss. When some Russian thugs break into his house to steal his car and kill his dog, he goes on a calculated killing spree to exact revenge. It's a corny, stupid premise that succeeds in part from Keanu's own personal history and the genuine sweetness in the dog-owner relationship. It's a fully formed universe of characters that we meet (the gangster hotel manager, the eccentric lobby boy, the good-natured dead-body clean-up crew) that nicely compliment the effectively awesome yet human Wick. Sure, there are moments of exploitation, and some may think it's just vengeance porn, but I disagree. The attitude of the film is pitch-perfect: it's an angry film that doesn't let its rage get in the way of its immense entertainment, and is never too serious for its own good. It perfectly balances the fast-loud with the slow-quiet. The non-linear storytelling, the sharp humor, and the portrayal of what happens between action scenes all give it a cool feel. Mindless entertainment? MaybeÂbut when something's this excellent, who cares?","

"anthonyjtnorris","27 January 2015","This movie was excellent. There are a lot of new faces in this movie which would make me feel it's low budget, but the actors have all put their best in to this film and you can see it.on screen. I have seen so many films that just don't capture the viewers eye, this movie keeps the viewer glued to the screen in till the end. It also ends of a cliffhanger which I always find is best. Keanu was a great choice for this role, he plays a hit-man with ease, but there is always a little spark which he puts into his acting which makes him stand out from the crowd.All in all 9 out of 10. By far better than any other action movie of the past 2 years.","

"eoinpgeary","19 March 2023","John wick was something very fresh in an age of action movies, what I believe drove it's success and appeal to an audience that seemed to grow and grow was the hand to hand combat, John using many different fighting techniques, weapons and all of it felt and looked so real, there were so many continuing shots and it's a testament to Keanu who performed the majority of his own stunts.The story is simple, his wife passes and leaves him a dog who ends up getting killed by a Russian thug who is the son of a high up Russian mobster. Believe me when I say it's not the story we show up for, it's nice to get it and in further movies we do, but it's the action.With so many comic movies and other action movies I can't think of many that even come close to these fight scenes, Netflix Daredevil would be the closest.I enjoyed most of this movie, not to gone on the last 20 minutes to be honest but overall it's a fantastic movie.","

"Kmark1293","26 October 2014","Personally, I am not really a big fan of the clichÃ©d revenge plot, especially when its applied to big Hollywood action movies. However, as soon as the positive buzz about John Wick started to come around, I started to become more curious about checking it out in theaters. It felt weird seeing great reviews out of a revenge story at first, but in the end, it turned out to be a pretty good action thrill ride.John Wick takes the plot of a hit-man coming out of retirement to duke out justice on those who dare to mess with the things he loved and turns it into a fairly unique story. Sure, there are certain clichÃ©s and a delivery of cheesy lines at times, but the movie manages to not take itself seriously and makes those aspects work. Although it may a paper thin plot to begin with, its serviceable enough to introduce our characters and jumps straight into the action.The acting throughout is also serviceable enough for the type of action-driven story the movie was going for. Keanu Reeves may not be the greatest actor in the world and I can probably name 10 other actors that are worse than him, he somehow manages to put on a good performance. Its his best work of acting since The Matrix and I believe Reeves was meant to be an action star along the lines of Schwarzenegger and Statham. As for the rest of the cast including Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, William Dafoe, and Dean Winters, lets just say that they do a solid job portraying their given characters. They aren't really bad by any means, its just the main focus is on John Wick since he is the title of the film.In terms of technical aspects, its pretty much the strongest part about the movie. The lighting gives the film a very dark and gritty feel throughout its run-time and its certain shading of blue colors also adds to the film's bleak environment. Every camera shot is smooth and steady and they keep a tight focus on showcasing the fast paced action on screen. Speaking of action scenes, they are also executed brilliantly through excellent choreography and great editing, all without having to resort to unnecessary shaky cam.John Wick is one of the best American action flicks to come out in quite some time. It may not be on the same level as The Raid 2, it still come in pretty close in terms of high octane action. Its simple story and characters give you something to work off of and its adrenaline fueled action sequences will have you on the edge of you seat and wanting more when its all over. If you are the type of person who craves this crazy level of vengeance and violence, then you owe to yourself to go and check out John Wick. Definitely worth a recommendation.","

"RIK-22","16 January 2015","Of course the plot is nothing new, it's your usual revenge story. However the delivery of this well-trodden path is told in such a quirky, interesting and stylish manner, it makes all the difference.First off, the camera work and fights scene are superb. Please any director making Bourne, James Bond or the awful Inception, keep the bloody camera on and at a distance. This stupid jumping, cutting every 2 nanoseconds with a camera 5 centimeters from the nose of the actor, is awful. It ruins any action movie.We know the story is clichÃ©, so the director presents the story in a very chic and interesting way, which doesn't leave you bored. There is also this tongue-in-cheek criminal world with its own rules and quirks, which adds to the interest.I notice from other reviews there is a lot of focus on the revenue story, being boring and routine. There are almost no original plots these days, most stories are based around a simple plot of love or revenge. This is no different, but what elevates it above so many other actions films is the style, pacing and brilliant fighting scenes. It doesn't dwell on the obvious, it treats the viewer with some intelligence.There is very little unnecessary obvious join-the-dots dialog. Everything is keep lean, fast and minimal. It doesn't hide the inevitable story, it embraces and celebrates it.Before someone accuses me of being someone with no film experience, I am in my 40's and have seen way too many movies, I find nearly everything predictable and dull. This one was a very pleasant surprise in a sea of mediocrity.","

"Scarecrow-88","1 November 2014","I'll say this about John Wick, this sure wasn't boring! The plot set up is ridiculous and laughable. A dog's death--and animal lovers may just get behind this (me realizing this as I write it)--fuels the rage of a former hit-man named John Wick (Keanu Reeves in a role tailor made for him), known to as the man you call to ""kill the boogeyman"". Wick had left behind a trail of dead bodies, a life where he perfected the art of the execution. A man he worked for, a Russian crimelord named Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist, of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series), unfortunately has an entitled punk kid named Josef (Alfie Allen; Game of Thrones) who seems to look for trouble and has been coddled by his pops to the point that he is burdened to clean up his messes. When Josef sees John parked by a gas tank pumping for a 69 Mustang, he wants it and, along with a couple of his crook cronies, home invade Wick, taking the keys of the car and killing his cute pet dog (purchased for John by his dying wife as a parting gift so he wouldn't be all alone). So Wick, furious and seething with rage, will wage a one-man war against any of Viggo's hired thugs and hit men (or hitwoman as one case arises) that gets in his way of executing Josef. Because Josef is such a creep, seeing him narrowly escaping Wick who must destroy an army of Russian henchmen, it is hard to imagine even Viggo would be so inclined as to relinquish so much in favor of saving the piece of human excrement. Yet family means somethingÂuntil Wick has a grenade gun pointed at him! Viggo hires Willem Dafoe's Marcus to take out Wick, but he instead winds up rescuing him twice from narrow demise. Dafoe, just to tell you, is rather wasted in his role, but with Ian McShane (as the owner of an exclusive hotel for a particularly criminal clientÃ¨le), Bridget Moynahan (as the wife who dies from cancer, supposedly ""taken by God because of Wick's life of murder for money""), and John Leguizamo (as the owner of a car shop that seems to operate illegal chop shopping) all make brief appearances as folks Wick encounters or knows. McShane's character has eyes and ears that could very well assist Wick on his journey because rules within his ""Continental"" were not met (Adrianne Palicki of the Friday Night Lights television show is a hitwoman who accepts a contract that would urge her to break the code held for anyone within the confines of the hotel to not practice within this ""safe zone"") and it was because of Viggo this was usurped. So Wick has friends that will help him on his mission.With plentiful gun violence and lots of John Woo-stylized gunplay within martial arts and hand-to-hand combat, ""John Wick"" rarely takes a breath once it gets going. It starts dramatically and once Josef does what he does, the film takes off and remains a body count actioner the rest of the way. With a determined face that has a lot of ticked off aggression barely contained, Reeves recovers some of that old action star mojo that was missing in the big budget flop, ""47 Ronin"". The film does absolutely nothing newÂsimply put, Reeves, with guns, fighting skills, knives, and speed, cuts a swath through a lot of men, leaving a mess of bodies in his wake. I think the first major sequenceâin Wick's home when Viggo sends some men to kill himâshows Wick kill about 20 men in like three or four minutes. Oh, just wait until you see him in the Red Circle clubÂViggo has a lot of bought ""protecting bodyguards"" that service the film as gun fodder. Not to let cars go to misuse, we see lots of vehicular carnage where men don't fare well as open targets on foot (or inside the car). It doesn't matter if men are up close or at a distance, Wick can put down targets with relative ease and barely flinch. It is like watching a shoot-em up video game. Wick is a bad ass who drops human targets of all shapes and sizes from all directions. You enter his orbit or within his line of sight (and are an enemy threatening his mission), your ass is grass. If this is of interest to you, check the film out. Don't expect to receive a cerebral dramatic work of artÂthis ain't it. But Wick will not only shoot you in the eyeball or forehead, he'll make sure to punch you in the larynx or break your arm before doing so.","

"ryanmo-35178","7 September 2022","Heard long that it's a good movie, and seeing it has several chapters and thus starting to watch. The start was very attractive as he seems to be weak, but when everyone mentioned him, all of them were frightened. As the son killed his dog and stolen his car, he aimed to revenge! As the son of the big boss of gangster, he was hugely protected and thus John needs to kill and kill and kill. The fight scenes and shooting scenes are full of taste of Hong Kong movies. As a 50 men Keanu was good in shape. But without any twist and just kill and fight, the ending seems a little boring. Hope the following episodes will be better~","

"bkoganbing","30 December 2014","Watching John Wick I was sure that this was a project offered first to Sylvester Stallone. Stallone was just the kind of guy to go to war with the Russian mob and win as Keanu Reeves does here.John Wick is a retired hit-man and walked away from the life of crime because of the love of a good woman. The good woman dies, but has a dog sent to Reeves as a remembrance. Actually I can sort of understand that. I recently acquired a cat from someone who was close to me and died unexpectedly. If I had Keanu's killing skills I might do what he does.But definitely this was a role that cried for Rambo as Keanu plows through the Russian mob. The son of the mob leader tries to rip off Keanu's car and beats him up in the process and kills the dog. That last remembrance of his wife puts him over the edge and then look out Russians.I did find it hard to wrap my mind around the concept of an organized crime safe house where Reeves takes up residence while he does his thing. An interesting part is played by Adrianne Palicki as a female hit woman who wants to show up the men in the profession by taking down the guy who was number one. Ditto for Willem Dafoe playing an old associate of Reeves in the murder business.Keanu's fans will enjoy this, action fans who like lots of blood and gore in their cinema will like it. Still Stallone would have pulled this off better.","

"Troy_Campbell","1 November 2014","In his first bona fide hit for quite some time, Keanu Reeves is an assassin on a warpath after Russian crims kill his puppy and steal his car. If that sounds a touch silly, that's because it is, but this movie whole-heartedly embraces its bonkers premise and revels in presenting a genre film with tongue firmly in cheek. Screenwriter Derek Kolstad builds a semi-fantastical world where hit men (and hitwomen of course) have their own underworld currency, a special hotel sanctuary with doctors on site and a nightclub where hired killers can unwind, and, obviously, a guild who ensures the assassin moral code is upheld. This endearing self- awareness ensures John Wick is amusingly engaging between the numerous action sequences, which are, surprisingly, of an extremely high calibre. A blend of the economic gun-fu from Equilibrium and the close quarters krav maga made popular in the Bourne trilogy, the expertly choreographed fight scenes (tacked on finale excluded) are frenetic, exhilarating and joyously violent. Reeves is clearly having a blast playing the revenge driven yet cool-as-a-cucumber protagonist, whilst the rest of the cast â including Willem Dafoe, Adrianne Palicki, Michael Nyqvist and Alfie ""Theon Greyjoy from GoT"" Allen â do what they can with shared screen time; Palicki's arrogant hired gun shining brightest. A B-grade flick wrapped in A-grade style, John Wick is exceptionally enjoyable.","

"Quinoa1984","30 April 2016","I read a Todd Solondz quote once (yeah, weird way to start a review for John Wick but stick with me, folks), where he was talking about his movie Happiness and how it's actually quite simple to gain sympathy from an audience, and he talked about how the writer can just give a character cancer and everyone will feel sorry for that person and if you make someone a victim (and he/she's not right off the bat the villain or something) then there's identification right away. At the start of this movie we don't know who this man John Wick exactly is or what he does or how he can afford such a good house and car, but we do know that he has just lost his wife to some sickness and that she left him as a parting gift a dog so that he could move on with his life. And not any old dog or some mangy thing from the vet, but the cutest goddamn puppy that you could ever lay your eyes on. Needless to say things look good... until Wick happens to stop at a gas station, a Russian s***-head talks some crap (good ol' 'Reek' from Game of Thrones Alfie Allen, who is another good s***-head here), then that night the mobsters come to his house, trash it, beat him up and, worst of all, kill the dog.The writers go for a premise that's fairly easy and borderline lazy; of course we want to see Wick get the payback on these guys - even as they were once his former employers and ironically, in order to really retire, he had to pull a number that set up the Russian mobster's empire in cozy terms - because they killed the pretty-witty-wicky dog! As the Dude would say in Big Lebowski, this aggression will not stand! What ensues from here is a whole lot of violence and carnage, peppered with a whole lot of good character actors and awesome people - Willem Dafoe, Ian McShane, Dean Winters, Adrienne Palikci, Lance Reddick (remember him from The Wire and Oz?) - and that's about it. In that way it's admirable as a kind of meat-n-potatoes flick for the guys (and maybe some girls out there too): watch Keanu Reeves kill a LOT of people. But there are two things that I didn't expect out of what is basically a gigantic action kill-fest that is a time-waster: 1) the fight and stunt choreography, and how the director and cameraman and editor get it all together, works with some tight and efficient work while also being complex at the same time. You can tell where everyone is in relation to one another whether it's Keanu and a dozen guys on a club floor, or just him and Palicki getting dirty (not *that* dirty, the fighting kind) in a hotel room, or three cars in a high speed chase. It's not chaotic but it is intense work and I got more drawn in to it than I expected.The 2) is that there's a whole lot of good background to this world that Wick is in. What I mean is that it almost resembles something out of a comic book (for adults) in a good way: it's like there's this whole set up functionality for someone like Wick to work in, to the point of almost (or simply being) satirical. I had a big laugh at one moment when a cop (just one) comes to Wick's place after he guns down a whole bunch of guys at night, they know each other apparently and he sees a dead guy on the floor behind him, and he just gives him a 'have a good night' and walks away. Then the cleaning crew comes (what do they do when they're *not* cleaning up, or maybe there's always work to be done as far as disposing of bodies in this New York), and then there's the hotel that Wick stays at while he looks for Josef, and it's run like a hotel *for* the criminal element, as if they are always expecting guys with guns to be in their midst and only as that, maybe, they keep it down a little.This is a heightened reality as opposed to something fully realistic, but this added to my pleasure watching the movie. I wanted to see a whole movie set in this world that McShane's character seems to run - like some old film-noir he sits in a jazz club (lit very prettily, this is a colorful movie for big chunks) - and that Reddick is the concierge I suppose. The problem though is that underneath all of this style and potential for a much grander experience it's still a shallow action movie. In a way it may work for this kind of material that it's simply ""you stole my car, you killed my dog, and my wife...""; for an audience coming to this, maybe too much ambiguity would muddy the waters. But I wish the filmmakers, who are clever enough to put in the touches of a much larger environment for these criminals (Dafoe has a good if predictable role also as a hit-man by the way), had gone a little further.As it stands I liked it, though by a certain point - like say in the last twenty minutes - it starts to get into overkill territory. I was still into it for the action and would recommend it simply on those terms. But if you're looking for something challenging as far as engaging/challenging and audience's sympathies, you won't get it. This is all about Reeves punching, kicking, slamming, knifing, blasting, crashing, shooting, choking, and doing everything under the sun, and while he's not Neo here he might as well be.","

I have rated better movies with less, but this movie, in relation to others of the genre is simply awesome! To attempt to break down the logic of the movie a bit... The reasons why Keanu goes after this pathetic excuse of a son are not logical. Any reasonable person would expect him to accept the mobster's offer and get the car back and a new dog. Well, guess what! If he had done what was reasonable, we would not have a movie in the end! What happens after that is actually against all logic and it's what I love about the movie. He goes into impossible situations, just to survive and some more! In my mind, he could be a Tarantino character this guy. I assume that no one would complain then. Overall, his character, the situations and the discussions in the movie, seem to me like reading a comic or graphic novel of some kind. His face, his way of moving, everything, generated still images of a comic book in my mind. This is what I loved about the movie and this special flavor in the end made me love it. It was watching a movie and reading a good graphic novel all in one. The acting from the father-crime lord is from my point of view, exemplary for any type of movie and of course I loved the addition as the receptionist of the guy from Fringe TV Series (I am really bad with names!). The ending is satisfactory for me although I would have liked more (a) a slower death for the son and (b) a quicker death for the mobster father, since he gave him all this crap in the movie. Overall a nice way to spend your evening if you are not up for a really mind-puzzling movie. Keanu Reeves was really good for the first time after quite some movies.","

"lesleyharris30","27 October 2015","John Wick is a good movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast. It's a simple action movie that never wants to be anything more than that, it never gets too complicated, it's story is easy to follow and the action sequences are amazingly choreographed, it's a huge surprise to know that it's made by two first time directors, because they already seem like professionals. I felt the movie needed more depth, though I did certainly feel certainly feel for the main character, they glossed over the story about his wife, it should have been more constructed, it's only an hour and forty minutes long, and they easily could have added an extra fifteen minutes to develop their relationship some more. The performances are excellent, there are some top class acting from the likes of Michael Nyqvist, Willie Dafoe and Ian McShane, but the best performance certainly goes to Keanu Reeves, who shines in this film and, for the first time since the Matrix, he feels like a real action star, his characterisation for Wick is terrific, he's flawed, emotional and vengeful, it's a character that we can easily feel for and support. Action packed and a ton of simple fun, I would recommend John Wick to anyone looking for a good action. A hit-man comes out of retirement in order to take down the men who took everything he loves away from him. Best Performance: Keanu Reeves Worst Performance: Omar Barnea","

"Hey_Sweden","11 July 2015","Slick, stupid, senseless action entertainment stars Keanu Reeves in the title role. Wick is a former assassin whose wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan, in a thankless role) dies from an unspecified disease. The lonely and distraught Wick receives a final present from her one night: a beagle puppy named Daisy. Soon, Russian creeps led by the infantile Iosef (Alfie Allen) break into his home, steal his car, and beat Daisy to death. Now Wick has nothing left to live for but revenge, and he goes after the Russian mob - his old employers - with a ferocious tenacity.This viewer felt about as bad as he could for Mr. Wick, given that the characters - all of them, really - are thinly written. While it provides some visceral joy watching this force of nature unleash his fury on a non-stop parade of thoroughly expendable action movie villains, there's not that much humanity. The guy wades through henchmen so quickly that he turns into the kind of superhero too often seen in this genre. Fortunately, he does take *some* lumps before this is over, and at one point it looks as if it might be curtains for him.There is a ton of violence, and a ton of digital splatter, although not very much that would be likely to seriously gross out some viewers. The pacing is definitely of a very deliberate variety, until the story - such as it is - begins to take off. While all of this is mildly amusing, ""John Wick"" doesn't really do anything that we haven't seen before in scores of action-revenge sagas.Keanu is once again a figure in minimalist ""acting""; in his one attempt to truly emote, he does his best, but he's still not that convincing. Ian McShane and John Leguizamo are thoroughly wasted in cameo roles; Willem Dafoe gets a little more to do. Swedish star Michael Nyqvist offers some fun as the mob boss. Allen is such a weasel that he can't die soon enough. Adrianne Palicki, like Nyqvist, is entertaining enough as a persistent would be hit woman. Other familiar faces include Lance Reddick, Dean Winters, Daniel Bernhardt, Randall Duk Kim, Clarke Peters, Kevin Nash, and the always welcome (if much too briefly seen) David Patrick Kelly as the leader of a team that cleans up peoples' messes.""John Wick"" is an agreeable enough, but also forgettable, way to kill 102 minutes.Six out of 10.","

"siderite","13 January 2015","You have to watch this film knowing that its makers wanted to pay homage to manga, old style samurai movies and directors like John Woo. Everything is... ordered, like something in a Japanese film. There is a code for everything, a way to do things that has to be followed. That is why when the action starts and there are some obvious shortcuts to everything, people don't take them. I am pretty sure somewhere there is a Japanese samurai script or manga that they adapted and the original characters did everything with swords.The choreography is decent, with Keanu doing a combination of Matrix and Equilibrium moves that (finally!) are not all in slow motion. The basic plot is that his character gets angry and starts killing people and then the film ends. If you don't appreciate the style, then the film will be wasted on you.That being said, I have to say that I think the film was not that good. It was not bad, but there were opportunities missed to make it truly unique and memorable. As such, one enjoys the actions scenes then forgets the movie. One of these opportunities was to use the amazing cast they had. Forget that Bridget Moynahan had only a few scenes in some flashbacks and that sexy Adrianne Palicki was completely underexposed, but actors the like of Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo should have been the bread and butter of the film. Instead, they were relegated to minimal supporting roles.Unexpectedly for the film, but totally expected of the actor, the best action scenes where those involving Daniel Bernhardt, who moved with the same grace and precision that he had when he did all those martial arts films in his youth. He was so good that it just showed he could have kicked Keanu's behind any time he wanted to.Another opportunity was a detailing of Wick's glory days. Instead we are treated with a monologue vaguely explaining how awesome and efficient Wick was when he was a contract killer. Really? He wasn't that way in the film! Keanu played his usual silent brooding self, but at least in one scene, the one where he shouts at Viggo to give him the son, he shows the potential that was lost in writing his character.Bottom line: a rather average action flick, feeling more like a video game than a samurai movie. Instead of minutes and minutes of nameless minions being killed, a strong contouring of the characters, at least of the main ones, would have been a lot more effective. Like many others, I am sure, I was attracted to see the movie by the cast which was, unfortunately, underutilized.","

"reoroy","15 November 2014","Keanu Reeves is back in form as "" John Wick "" and how. Keanu must have been waiting for a long time to play a role like this. Both John Wick's wife and the dog she had gifted him, get killed and he sets out to avenge their deaths. The movie is approximately an hour and a half long and comprises of some insane action sequences coupled with some amazing background music. And Keanu justifies playing a role like this all the more because his name is synonymous with "" The Matrix Trilogy"" and ""Speed"". Ever since the Matrix movies released I've always wanted Keanu to play meaningful action-oriented roles. Unfortunately he hadn't managed to bag such roles until he signed for this movie.Keanu's looks in this movie have been planned in accordance with the nature of his character and the trying times his character is shown to be going through.Also, another plus point of this movie is that the villains look menacing. In an 'out-an-out' action thriller like this, it's imperative that the villains look their parts and each and every one of them have played their parts to perfection. Willem Dafoe does a fantastic job as Marcus.So Keanu Reeves has been a part of a good movie after a long hiatus. Whch is why people should go to the nearest theater and watch this movie as soon as possible.","

"view_and_review","6 February 2015","Every so often two movies are released the same calendar year with a similar storyâala Dante's Peak and Volcano, both released in 1997, Deep Impact and Armageddon in 1998, The Illusionist and The Prestige in 2006, Olympus has Fallen and White House Down in 2013 or we can go all the way back to 1984 with Breakin' and Beat Street. I mention this because part way through this movie I couldn't help but realize how eerily similar it is to The Equalizer.The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington, was about a retired, highly skilled agent that was living alone because he had lost his wife. He was drawn out of retirement by the Russian Mafia because of their iniquities.John Wick, starring Keanu Reeves, is about a retired, highly skilled assassin that lives alone because he lost his wife. He has also been drawn out of retirement by Russians because of their iniquities. That's where the similarities end. Even though John Wick is a good movie I give the nod to The Equalizer over it for a few reasons: 1.) Denzel over Keanu. Reeves still has all of the range of a cardboard cutout.2.) The story. Every vengeance/vigilante film requires an impetus for the revenge/vigilantism. Sometimes we, the viewer, don't really care what that reason is, we just want to see some professional butt whipping. Even if that is the case, that's not to say that some causes are not better than others. The cause in John Wick was good just how it came about was very elementary.3.) The head scratching moments. John Wick has three moments that leave you scratching your head with a puzzled look on your face. They are fairly obvious as they are right out of the movie clichÃ© manual. It doesn't cripple the movie but it makes you wonder: in this day and age with a hundred years of movies to refer to, why drum up the same old good guy and bad guy clichÃ©s?Those are my only beefs. They aren't enough to ruin the movieÂ well, they might ruin it for some. Once the action kicks into gear it's a real treat. John Wick is masterful with a gun. It's like he took martial arts classes with guns. Instead of giving you a well-placed punch or kick, he uses bullets. And there was something they did well in this movie which I'd never seen in a movie before this one. John Wick had to often, and quite obviously, change magazines in his weapons. John Wick made it very apparent that his guns do not have magazines with unlimited rounds, and that you very well may have to replace a magazine at a very inconvenient time. That was refreshing.","

"abouhelier-r","30 October 2014","An ex-hit-man comes out of retirement to track down the gangsters that took everything from him. John Wick is a new action movie starring Keanu Reeves, directed by David Leitch and Chad Stahelski. Since a little while I'm a huge fan of Keanu Reeves and I watched many of his interviews; he really seems to be a very cool and down to earth gentleman. I've heard and read many positive things about John Wick. It's one of the best action movie of the year and possibly Keanu Reeves' best performance since a long time. It doesn't arcane back to the 80's action movies ,actually it's an excellent 2014 action movie, no nostalgia required. Firstly, this film blew my mind and Keanu Reeves gives a lot of himself which is such a great thing to see. He is the perfect actor for the lead role. Everything he does is cool: driving, fighting, shooting and even speaking. All those things in general are what an action hero has to do in a good action movie. He is bad ass but also as he's retired for a certain time it makes him rusty enough to produce an interesting and tensional movie. Plus, John Wick is a slick looking movie, with fantastic action scenes and most importantly and surprisingly great dialogue scenes as well. The main villain of the movie starring Michael Nyqvist (Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol and Millennium) is absolutely terrific, Russians seems to always be the bad guys. In fact all the acting on this film is really good. I think it's actually Keanu Reeves' best film since The Matrix. Mainly because this film requires a lot of an actor, it's fantastic to see him properly doing the action scenes. He knows how to sell action; but I'm not only talking about physical work, he also has some very emotional scenes which involved a lot of anger and despair; he does a very great job with all of them. The screenplay is good, it's not only a revenge/ killing movie. There been a lot of action world creation, you learn a lot about these underworld war criminal. I completely understand why the hero goes on this bloody path. I have a dog. If anyone hurts my dog for any reason I'll do John Wick on them. Plus, the Club scene is the best scene of the whole movie, it reminds me of a club scene in Collateral which is crazy good action. However, the only flaw I could see in this film is the end; as my mum would say: the end seems a little bit forced up and a little bit put together really fast. That's it. Finally, John Wick also sets up ideas of sequel (not being forced like in The Maze Runner). You are able to see the character's evolution and the potential for a franchise along the movie. John Wick's the nicest guy ever just don't screw with him. Overall John Wick has incredible shoot out sequences, it's anon-stop action movie that actually has a clever script, a really awesome hero, a great villain (a few great villains actually). It does everything an action movie is supposed to do, it understands what its doing and does it extremely well. Go see this film!","

"perica-43151","7 May 2021","This movie parts with logic on many an occasion, but it gives high importance to stylized doom game style head-shots. What is cool is reputation Keanu's character brings in, in the style of ""your reputation precedes you"" and ""my name Wick, John Wick"". In fact, Wick is originally Belorussian, as revealed in the sequels that are better than the original, and movie is not anti-Russian, in fact, Russian mobsters used to be John's friends and employers, just happen to have a millennial son or should we say SOB, with typical entitlement and lack of character issues, together with millennial trademark, an entirely empty head. The franchise plus dogs up my grade quite a bit. Taken on its own merits, the movie is little more than stylized game-play of some doom game descendant, that lacks most in the area of elementary logic. Wick kills close to 100 associates of the stupid entitled millennial's poor mobster father who is his ex boss and who respects him still, but when given a clear chance to rid of this ""baba yaga"" Wick menace, the boss does not take it. This is perhaps the most glaring plot-hole, but there are many others, since movie asks us to suspend disbelief too many times. Realism dies early in the movie, but as a substitute there is an alternative universe in which assassin coins are used for assassin business, and there is that Continental assassin safe house hotel. Such infrastructure implies abundance of assassins but who are they assassinating every day? Not even small army would need this but in war zone there is no shortage of targets, perhaps there needs to be so many assassins since they keep killing themselves at such a rate, but it is perhaps best not to overthink anything in this piece of stylized gun-game-play. It is comforting to think that life of one doggy who you barely had for a week is worth countless hooman lives, dog owners would certainly unleash hell on those who dare kill our best friends, so noble in their disposition, so uncorrupted by temptations other than juicy treats, so loyal and superior in character that, yes, he who truly knows humans cannot help but adore dogs.","

"HelenMary","9 July 2015","Reeves is back to his Point Break, Speed, Matrix action-best. Wick a violent, visceral fast-paced high kill-rate film with a vintage slick and eminently cool feel to it. Reeves owns the screen, and reveals a physicality which belies his age. He throws himself around and is believable as the suave professional 'mechanic' anti-hero.The story - I'll admit - is a little far-fetched if you take it too seriously, the bad guys are a little hammy and one-dimensional but Reeves brings a grace and gravitas to the role of Wick which shows off just how good he is. The martial arts are unusual, original and superbly choreographed and, like Jackie Chan, Wick uses anything to hand and is more fragile and realistic than most action anti-heroes, he is breakable and you believe he might just not make it. Cute puppy scenes, cuter puppy and Keanu scenes - is there anything better than a scene with a handsome man and a gorgeous puppy? The brutal scenes with the dog - Daisy - will upset some but bear with the film. It's quietness and lack of complex dialogue works well with Reeves and the story, there is a calm about him which is a juxtaposition to what he does for a living, is capable of, and this is depicted rather well with the unusual punky/rock soundtrack.Watch it. Probably a favourite for boys everywhere, martial arts fans, Keanu fans and definitely ladies that like guys with guns and an easy power that makes your knees wobble. It is a stunningly shot film... an old school feel, slick, and dark and totally entertaining.","

"IronBallsM","25 October 2014","I have to say given the hype, I was quite disappointed in this effort. I expected way more story and at least some intrigue. Instead, the film is an hour and a half of Keanu running around slickly shooting various different people in the head. He's angry that they killed his dog (his only chance at acceptance and peace after the death of his wife) and goes around dispatching everyone who gets in his way with head shot after head shot. That's it. Honest to God, THAT is the entire film and it's not even a spoiler because the trailer tells us as much. There's no other plot and nothing to any supporting character whatsoever. The kill action is, again, slick but nothing rises above cut video game type sequences. At least it does make a viewer stop and ponder why all the action movies we grew up watching don't factor in close range gun shots to the head more often.","

"mitchell5954","29 October 2014","John Wick is easily the best action film since Skyfall. I might even like this more than Skyfall actually. This is better than any of the Expendables films, even Expendables 2. John Wick is a badass revenge flick that knows what it is and goes all-out with it. This film doesn't try to be something it isn't or be overly complicated to try to appease a certain audience. This film is really what the film Machete should've been. Machete was advertised as an awesome revenge film that brought back classic action films, but it really wasn't. It tried to be deep and relevant with constant preaching about the border and it really detracted from what the film initially was supposed to be and it was very boring and quite disappointing. This film knows what it is and it is really refreshing. Keanu Reeves brings his A-game, as does all the side cast. The action is great and well-choreographed. The villain is badass and humorous at the same time.The story is simple and straight forward. John Wick is a former Hit-man but has been out of the game for five years. The film starts with his wife sadly dying and there is a funeral. Then he finds a dog on his doorstep which was his wife's final gift to him. Shortly after all that these mobsters start screwing with him. One of them is the son of the main villain, Viggo (Michael Nyqvist), who John once worked for. Eventually the beat him up and kill his dog, which was a huge mistake. John then snaps and goes on a killing spree to get these guys back.The character, John Wick, is definitely a badass you don't want to screw with. He doesn't talk much and he doesn't need to. He lets his actions speak for him and he's merciless. He doesn't screw around at all. He reminds be a lot of Liam Neeson in Taken. This film has a very similar feel to Taken. For example, I like how it's basically John Wick verses everybody for the most part. Dafoe helps him out a bit but it's mainly John by himself wasting an army of mobsters just like it was Liam Neeson by himself wiping-out a ton of bad guys with no mercy or hesitation. There is no pointless love-interest, goofy sidekick, or stupid comic relief characters put it. It's just John Wick by himself which is how it should be. However I like this film more than Taken for a couple reasons that I'll get to.What's particularly cool about Wick is just the amount of build-up and praise he gets by everyone in the film including the main villain. What I like is that all the characters in this film seem to know each other particularly John himself. Everyone in this film respects John Wick and/or fears him which makes all the more badass. This shows that Keanu Reeves is great if given the right role. Many people trash him but I never found him a bad actor.Another thing that makes this film awesome is its side characters. William Dafoe has a smaller role as John's old friend and fellow Hit-man. Dafoe is always awesome in any role he's in. You can put him in a lame Goblin costume straight from the set of Power Rangers and he'll come out awesome. The rest of the cast is equally memorable. The side characters don't get much time but they make the most of what little they have to do and all of them have presence.The villain, Viggo, is also quite strong. I like that him hand Wick know each other, have worked together before, and that Viggo has a respect for John and is even quite scared of him. The way he describes John in the beginning and his constant uneasiness when he finds out he's back I find quite funny and awesome at the same time. He could've just been a nothing villain that was basically just a punching bag for Wick, but he has some pretty badass moments and has a presence to him. This is the reason I like this film more than Taken. In Taken the side characters weren't very strong and neither were the villains but that is not the case here.The action is great as I said earlier. The fights are well-choreographed and there is hardly any shaky-cam. It's R-rated so they go all-out and it gets bloody. The film looks great and has an atmosphere to it. The length is just right for the film this is. If it was any longer it would've felt padded-out as some action film of late have.Overall, John Wick is a new modern action classic. It is definitely worth checking-out if you're into action films.","

"stevenrotherforth","1 March 2017","John WickA good action movie is a rare thing these days. Stallone, Arnie and all the heroes of old have become... well just that ...Old! Instead we have watered down action stars who rely on shaky cam to hide their lack of ability. Keanu Reeves however has always been a strong performer within this genre. A star who's action credentials go under the radar despite being in some of the best of all time. The Matrix, Speed, Point Break and Johnny Mnemonic. No wait forget the last one that was rubbish! So when a little movie by the name of John Wick turned up on our cinemas door step this was a nice surprise for action fans. Watching a geriatric Steven Seagal nearly putting his back out to get our action fix was becoming a little strained. Or watching Jean Claude and Dolph mumble through rehashes of movies they'd done before. Universal Soldier 14 anyone? John Wick is rather refreshing. This is a simple movie. Nasty men steal nice mans Ford Mustang and kill his puppy. Turns out nice man is an ex super assassin and his wife has just died! Time to get not so nice. Talk about picking on the wrong guy! The fella from Game of Thrones, the one who gets his wedding tackle cut off (Alfie Allen) is to blame for doing John Wick wrong. His crime boss father points out in one of the films many great scenes, ""John Wick is the man you send to kill the boogeyman and you just killed his dog!"" Absolutely brilliant! The way in which the myth of John Wick is created is truly fascinating. A story about a bar room and a pencil is wonderfully realised on screen helping give the titular character an air of invincibility. I think this film works so well because we care for John and understand what he's going through. We feel his pain. He's lost his wife. He's lost the very thing that guides him. A love that rescued and steered him away from his violent past. Keanu Reeves gives a stellar performance here. We feel the emotion ooze out of the screen. We see him descend back into his old ways. All he wants to do is grieve and the bad guys take that from him. Watching the scene with the dying puppy is one that will pull at the heart strings and fuel a violent anger in you, one you probably didn't know you had. John Wick has some interesting depth too despite being a simple film in terms of formula. The assassins world in which John is from is one of code and honour. There are rules. A world that is stylised on screen and one that could be expanded on when a sequel inevitably arrives. But what is an action movie without good action? Something that JW delivers big time. Every punch, kick and exploding head is delivered with a level of professionalism that just isn't seen very often in this genre anymore. As I mentioned before directors usually now rely on shaky cam or obscure camera angles to hide the fact that the lead actor just isn't up to it. Here we have wide angles where we can see the action played out to full potential. A visual feast for the action movie aficionado. Not over done or overly repetitive. Keanu Reeves is very good at his craft. Particularly when his craft requires him to kick ass on screen. People have criticised his acting ability but for me he is one of the best when it comes to action. He does most of the stunt work himself. Sure there are probably better martial artists out there or guys with bigger muscles but Reeves is a more all round package. Along with some colourful cinematography and ear popping sound, this is what we want from an action movie. I for one look forward to seeing him return but please don't harm anymore dogs. I don't think I could take it.","

Obviously this movie is super straightforward, predictable and for the most part emotionless that's not to say it was bad. If anything it was kinda refreshing to see some non stop action that was done really well.Like on its 20 million dollar budget it had better action sequences than 90 percent of marvel movies. The preformances are kind kf what you'd expect from this type of movie. No career topping ones but no real bad ones either. I can't say I was the biggest fan of the main villian, Viggo but only cause of how much he goes on about how dangerous John wick is and then proceeds to antagonise him for literally the whole movie. 8/10.","

"eric262003","30 November 2015","Even though Hollywood gets badly ostracized by the masses (including me) there comes a time when every now and then, it brings a surprisingly great film and ""John Wick"" clearly personifies that Hollywood doesn't always turn in money-wasting films. ""John Wick"" combines great solid action, with awesome visuals, subtle humour and provides something quite refreshing to the traditional action film. When first seeing this film I did have my doubts about it because of the formulaic stereotypes it has in this genre, but it didn't really bother me at all because I was enthralled by the visuals. And then I looked at who the scriptwriter is and I sighed because it was written by Derek Koldstad, who's been writing convoluted script for straight to DVD vehicles for Dolph Lundgren. And finally I checked in to see who directed it was by Chad Stahelski, a former stuntman who had some assistance from another stuntman, Davis Leitch. Whatever it was they did, it worked and I give my hats off to them for their efforts to bring something new to the table. From the opening scenes, the clichÃ©s come right to us without any denial. Keanu Reeves stars as John Wick, an ex-hit-man trying to get away from it all (like we've seen before). His wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) who has helped him break free from his old ways is now dying of a lingering progressive disease. In return she has left him an adorable little puppy so that he can remain the better man he's become. But then evil remorseless gangsters steal his car and kills his puppy like it was all in a day's work. What was dumb about these gangsters is they refused to do background checks as to which assassin they are dealing with. For the animal sensitive viewer, the scene was not entirely graphic, but it will make you hate the bad guys even more, like what's expected of a film like this. What makes matters worse is that the car is a 1969 Mustang. So therefore revenge is not optional here, it must be done, bar none.Even though he's been called down by the critics, but Keanu Reeves stars here and here he has succeeded in shutting up all those who have condemned him in the past. He was amazing here and may have exceeded his performances in ""The Matrix"" series. To me it feels like a new awakening for Keanu at 51 and is now making those who maligned him, to eat crow. What could I say? 50 is the new 40 and he never looked better.What really blew my mind about ""John Wick"" are the action scenes which are truly mesmerizing. The way they executed on screen was original being that it was subtle and not as campy or cartoon- like. The choreography was spot on and the fight scenes looked and felt authentic and convincingly deadly. The brutality and violence truly will get your heart pumping, and it'll hurt just thinking about it.The fight scenes offer up new elements and inventive in its delivery. But the cinematography is something about ""John Wick"" which can't be neglected. The colours of grey and brown offer a retro feeling reminiscent to the 1950's noir films with a modern twist to it. Set in New York City as a picturesque fantasy landscape your grandparents in the 1950's may have imagined what the Big Apple would look like today which even includes a ritzy hotel like The Continental, which is a facility for refuge, a social club and a relaxing centre for those who commit felonies. That' better then what we expected for underworld crime bosses who hang out in dilapidated apartments where they're gambling their fortunes with their beer mugs and ashtrays, therefore a place like The Continental looks like a better hangout spot for these guys. It has a bit of a ""Sin City"" thing going for it only more grounded and more real. With a sequel coming out I'll surely be the first at my ticket stand. ""John Wick"" has truly resurrected the action genre. It's brutal, violent and and no holds barred a gritty R-rated film that's not afraid to deliver or offend. It may have clichÃ©s, but once you seen the movie you'll forget all about the clichÃ©s.","

"kosmasp","4 June 2015","Keanu Reeves is back. Well it's not like he was gone (though you could argue his character was in this one, before being forced to be ""back""), but this might be his best movie in years. Certainly one he is starring in. And I don't mean any disrespect against 47 Ronin (which could've been a lot better and I'm not talking about the poor CGI at places, but in general).Wick is kind of an Equalizer, but different. While Denzel is clearly the better actor, this evens everything up with a choreography that really gives you everything it got. Gunkata is a term you might have heard a couple of years ago. It's here again and it's no wonder that the two directors have a good relationship with Keanu (since working with him before a couple of times).Great ""guest"" appearances and really good cinematography. This looks great and it has a lot of violence in it. If you're down with that, go ahead and watch and prepare yourself for the inevitable sequel/prequel or whatever comes our way","

"ginocox-206-336968","15 January 2015","""John Wick"" has a lot in common with ""The Equalizer"" (2013). Both feature a former highly skilled assassin who has retired to live in quiet solitude but who is compelled to use his deadly skills again when a Russian mobster commits a despicable act of violence. Denzel Washington is generally considered the better actor and brings a sense of gravitas to his role. However, Keanu Reeves brings more a sense of melancholy and reluctance to his role, which was sadly lacking in TE. Washington looks bigger, stronger and more physically imposing, but never displays any particular skill at martial arts. The fights in TE are shot in semi-darkness and edited with a lot of quick cuts, so Washington's character never seems truly credible as the tough fighter he is supposed to be. In contrast, the fight scenes in JW are masterfully choreographed. One can not only see, but follow the action. Reeves comes across as a much more credible action hero, skilled with guns, knives and his bare hands. The Russian mobsters are much more menacing, evil and capable in TE than in JW, where they are adequate, but less memorable. These gangsters are three-dimensional characters with flaws, foibles and idiosyncrasies that make them more realistic and even a little likable. They also have conflicting agendas, whereas the gangsters in TE are more narrowly focused and unwavering. JW also has a much better production design. The color palate, costumes and cinematography blow TE away. Neither film is perfect. JW starts off a bit slowly attempting to bolster motivations that don't need bolstering. But once it begins, maintains a steady action pace. Between the two, JW is much more enjoyable and Reeves is a better action hero than Washington. JW doesn't have quite the panache or complexity of ""Django Unchained,"" ""Rock 'n' Rolla,"" ""Smokin' Aces"" or the underrated ""Lucky Number Slevin,"" but it's a solid effort by all involved.","

"kluseba","31 October 2014","""John Wick"" is another fast-paced and graphic revenge movie with some entertaining action and black humour, a fitting soundtrack and the usual stereotypical characters from the Russian mafia. When it comes to gripping revenge flicks, you should rather watch South Korean movies like the intense ""The Man from Nowhere"" which is twice as good as this film, ""I Saw the Devil"" which is probably one of the most brutal movies ever made, the emotionally heart-breaking ""Blood Island"", as well as the philosophical trilogy around ""Sympathy for Mister Vengeance"", ""Oldboy"" and ""Lady Vengeance"" if you are looking for some originality, depth and character development. ""John Wick"" is only a hollow entertainment for genre fans. If I wasn't a fan of this kind of movies, my rating would be much lower than it is.The story is simple. John Wick was a hit-man working for the organized crime in New York City. He retired from his job and started a new life when he met the love of his life. Roughly four years later, John Wick loses his wife to cancer. He receives a posthumous gift from her in form of a puppy with a letter from his wife saying that she is gone and that John Wick should cope with her demise by loving the dog. Coincidentally, he encounters the son of his old boss who doesn't know him. The young Russian mafioso wants to purchase John Wick's vintage '69 Mustang but the grieving man refuses. A few hours later, the Russian mafioso breaks into John Wick's house without any problems as there seems to be no alarm system at all. With a few friends, the young criminal kills John Wick's beloved puppy, steals his car and is bright enough to take off his hood to show his face so John Wick surely knows who he is. The victim survives and goes on to kill around eighty criminals in the next ninety minutes of the movie. Of course, killing the naive culprit is not enough, he also kills his partners, colleagues, bodyguards, his old boss and a few guys in a church. In the end, everybody but John Wick is dead and he goes to the next veterinary hospital, walks off with a new dog and goes home as if nothing ever happened.This story is so bad that it could have been written by a twelve-year old. First of all, there are too many coincidences concerning the encounter with the Russian criminals who want to steel John Wick's car. In the entire movie, everybody is talking about John Wick's incredible reputation and everybody knows him wherever he goes but the son of the most influent criminal is the only one who has never heard of him. It's not credible that a smart hit-man doesn't have any alarm system to protect his home. One can understand that the killing of the puppy his wife gave to him really hurts John Wick but taking this event to justify eighty or more murders is not credible at all. In the entire movie, there is no police or anything despite all the shootings in downtown New York City. All of John Wick's enemies are extremely stupid, unexperienced and wooden. Even thirty men in one building can't manage to fight him. I could go on for hours as this movie is filled with so many coincidences, plot holes and unrealistic scenes that it's amusing. If you tell me know that the story doesn't matter in a revenge action movie, just watch any of the movies mentioned in the introduction that prove that even the grisliest revenge thriller can have some depth. Even ""The Raid"" franchise is more realistic and has better plots. ""John Wick"" rather feels like a simplistic ego-shooter for video game consoles than an actual movie. I must though admit that the last Splinter Cell games had better story lines than this film.Another thing that feels out of place is the fact that fifty-year old Keanu Reeves is playing the unbeatable hit-man. The fighting scenes are somewhat wooden but he still manages to fight off his enemies because their acting is even slower. On the other side, Keanu Reeves also has a certain charisma to fit this role. Fifty-nine year old Willem Dafoe as veteran hit-man who has to kill John Wick is also a questionable choice in my opinion. Still, he is a respectable actor and has charisma. The most annoying thing is the fact that the evil guys are Russians again but that they are portrayed by actors from all around the world like England, Sweden and even Switzerland - except Russia. One can feel that these are wannabe Hollywood Russians and not real Russians.You may now ask yourself why I still gave a favourable rating to this flick. It's actually simple. This movie never gets boring. The action scenes are sometimes wooden but most of them are just shootings so it doesn't really matter. These scenes are well directed and include no annoying shaky cameras or overloaded special effects. The settings of the movie are well chosen and vary from dirty chop shops over elegant bath houses to Orthodox churches. There are a few memorable lines in this film as in many other action movies. Some graphic content is related to some dark and dry humour which made the whole thing easier to digest. I actually liked this combination of contradictory extremes and had to laugh quite a few times during the movie. The soundtrack of the movie is also enjoyable and fitting. For genre fans, there are enough entertaining and well-executed elements to enjoy this movie despite its obvious flaws.If you are looking for some fast-paced and superficial entertainment to switch your brains off, you will like ""John Wick"". If you are actually looking for a good movie that has more to offer than stylish violence, go for the movies mentioned in the introduction.","

"Tweekums","24 July 2016","John Wick's life is not going well; his wife of five years has recently died and he is barely holding things together. Then he receives one final gift from his wife; a puppy. It looks as if this is just what he needed to pull himself together but soon afterwards a group of young punks break into his house and attack him while looking for the keys to his classic carÂ they also kill the puppy. They also had no idea who they were messing withÂ until Wick met his wife he was the top assassin working for a Russian mobster in New York. The thief's father is that same Russian gangster and if he is to save his son he will have to kill Wick first. The killers sent after Wick are soon dispatched and now he is on the warpath; everybody who gets in his way is going to end up dead and a lot of people get in his way.If you are looking for a deep and meaningful story or even a sense of mystery you are likely to be disappointed with this; from the start we know who the bad guys are and we just know that before the film is over our protagonist will have killed them all along with countless heavies. If you want lots of action that feels real without obvious CGI, wirework, obviously choreographed fights and corny one-liners then this is just the thing. With its almost nonstop violent action it feels more like something John Woo would have made in his Hong Kong days than a typical Hollywood action movie. Keanu Reeves does an impressive job as Wick. Michael Nyqvist make a good bad guy and Alfie Allen is suitably unpleasant as his dog-killing son. They are also enjoyable turns from the likes of Willem Dafoe and Ian McShane. My only real complaint about the film is that the subtitles that appeared when anybody spoke Russian were tiny and not at the bottom of the screen so that they weren't that easy to read before they vanished; that wasn't a major problem as this film is about action not dialogue. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody after a proper action movie.","

"ginonachef-70-410141","16 October 2014","I got to go to a press screening last night! The movie is brilliantly paced, with fantastic (nonshaky cam) action that all feels fresh, new, innovative and unique. Had the theater gasping through each action set piece. the main character despite his unique skill set is very relatable. Keanu was at the top of his game and the director used Keanu's strengths and didn't bring up any weaknesses. Also Don't WATCH any more than the first trailer because I thought it spoiled a major part of the first act MINOR SPOILER ALERT (but was mentioned in the trailer so it shouldn't be a spoiler) the fate of his dog is revealed and would be better not knowing it going into the first act of the film. The supporting cast was great, except whenever i saw the State Farm guy (Mayhem), it took me out of the movie a little bit. But the film brings me right back in! I can't wait to see this again! It doesn't necessarily need to be seen in theaters but any movie is better in the theaters. The most surprising thing about the movie is how funny it is. i found myself grinning and laughing along with the rest of the theater throughout. Yet it doesn't drown out the Intense Drama that is the sturdy shell holding the movie together smoothly. The world that was set up was done perfectly and even though i don't want a sequel i would definitely see one either set in same universe or continuing the story arch from this movie. However the movie does stand on its own two feet as one that has a conclusive ending. The only flaw i found leaving the movie was that the dialogue at the end was a bit muffled. but this was a test screening so i'm sure that will be fixed by the time the movie is released. So for that i give this movie a 9.5/10 and recommend this to pretty much anyone with a like of action movies (yes even if you're female you will still enjoy this movie at least for the first 2 acts)","

"ReluctantPhilistine","22 November 2014","There is a scene in ""John Wick"" â the new shoot-em-up starring Keanu Reeves â in which the hero is about to be ""interrogated"" by the bad guys in true Jack Bauer fashion. Viggo Tarasov, the sinister Russian crime boss and Wick's former employer - played by Michael Nyqvist - takes the moment to sermonize. ""People don't change,"" he says to Wick. ""Times do."" Keanu Reeves used to be one of the biggest stars in Hollywood following the success of The Matrix, but afterwards, he never recaptured that superstar persona, despite his attempts at kitschy roles like the ones he played in ""47 Ronin"" or ""Constantine."" But Viggo was right, people don't change, and this film signals Keanu Reeves' return to the role of ass-kicking leading man that we first experienced in ""Speed"" and loved in ""The Matrix,"" and time has tempered him into a stronger and grittier action-star than he was 15 years ago. Reeves' character John Wick is one that we all know, the veteran hit man who is reluctantly pulled back into his past life to bloodily take revenge on all those who've wronged him. This film is essentially an assassin film with a fresh coat of paint. But although it's been done to death, I never had a chance to get bored, as the gripping pace and beautiful cinematography will keep you invested.John's wife dies early-on, but from cancer, not bullets. Wick is initially a grieving husband, and Reeves' emotionless stare is actually put to good use. The only company he keeps is a small puppy â his wife's last gift to him. When Russian criminals follow him home one day to steal his car â a sleek 69' Mustang â the dog is viciously silenced as Wick lay stunned on the ground.The men were members of the Russian crime syndicate, led by Viggo's hot-headed son Iosef (Alfie Allen), thinking Wick an ordinary man. But he was actually a hit man for Viggo before he retired, and was so successful that he was nicknamed ""Baba Yaga"" or The Boogeyman, the storybook embodiment of vengeance that punishes those who misbehave. Like the storybook character, Wick is an unstoppable force of nature, and the film follows him from gunfight to gunfight, chasing Iosef and gunning down subordinates while the Russians try to escape.This is an astonishing film for a directorial debut. David Leich and Chad Stahelski are both prolific stunt men â and they know how to film an action scene. The choreography strikes just the right balance between acrobatics and brutality, with scenes that smacked of 2006's ""Casino Royale,"" when the dapper Bond was re-invigorated with the frenetic energy of an action hero. The film may appeal more to that side of you that claps and squeals excitedly at explosions and loud noises, but there is enough character and personality here to justify a brief excursion into the land of campy blockbusters. Wick's mentor Marcus is played by a grizzled Willem Dafoe, and the owner of the Continental Hotel â an establishment that caters specifically to hit men â is played by Ian McShane. Even John Leguizamo puts in an intense yet brief performance as Aureilo, the owner of a chop-shop where the Russians take Wick's car. Everyone works for the Russians, so when Wick returns to the biz to exact his revenge, everyone knows him and continually ask him if he's back. It's funny, and the running dialogue refers to not only John Wick, but also to Reeves. And it must be said that whatever the film lacks in depth, it makes up for in coolness.Wick drives not just one sexy muscle car, but three. He alternates between wearing the ""Rebel without a Cause"" leather/T-shirt combo and the tailored suits of a professional killer. The music also alternates between groovy guitar riffs with rock overtones to deafening dance music with pounding pace-setting percussion. And the fisticuffs on display will have home viewers pausing and rewinding often to catch every crunch, twist, and snap. This is a film to be seen in IMAX. Late in the film, Wick escapes one hair-raising situation with a shower of bullets and attitude (spoilers I know), and is once again asked by a former associate if he's back in the game, while he stands, covered in gore and glory. ""Yeah,"" he says. ""I'm thinking I'm back.""Well Mr. Reeves, I think so too. Welcome back.","

"TdSmth5","16 February 2015","A car crashes against a wall. A seriously injured guy tumbles out. He starts watching a video of him with a woman.That takes us to the beginning in cut scenes. The guy was celebrating his anniversary with the woman who is ill. That night she collapses and dies in the hospital. The guy is devastated. Later he gets a delivery. It's a puppy. The woman arranged it to be sent to him once she dies, so he doesn't have to mourn alone.Next morning he goes for a drive in his classic Mustang with the puppy. At a gas station some Russian offers to buy the car. The guy refuses. The Russian doesn't take it too well. At night a bunch of masked guys break into the guy's house, kill the puppy, beat him up and steal the car. They take the car to a shop where the owner is outraged at the stupidity of the Russian. He known who the car belongs to. Then he gets a call from the Russian's father who's the big mobster. The shop owner tells him the son just stole John Wick's car.Now we learn from the mobster about John. He was the baddest unstoppable killing machine around till he retired when he met his wife. So he knows what's coming. His son doesn't get it and thinks he can do something about it. He sends an army to visit John at night. John dispatches them all and calls a specialized cleaning crew afterward. Now John unearths his gear, puts on a nice suit and checks into the Continental hotel--a safe house for hit men. There everyone thinks that John is back in business. He clarifies that it's just personal. The mobster puts a bounty on his head and that means that all the bad guys in town will go after him, including some at the safe house--which goes against the rules.John now goes after the son and eventually after the mobster father and later we return to the beginning.The trailer promised exhilarating action and the movie delivers. It's old-fashioned pistol action and athletic fisticuffs. If the title Bullet for the Head weren't taken it could have made an apt title for this movie as well, as John isn't just happy to empty a clip into some bad guy but has to finish things off by blowing their skulls open. It's R-rated action as it should be. When bloody action if filmed for PG-13 standards you end up with duds like the Taken sequels. It also has some original car action, not so much chases but cars used for shootouts. Cool stuff. Perhaps it goes a bit overboard in manipulating your emotions. It's not enough that the wife dies and that he's heart-broken, but they've got to kill the puppy and steal the cool car. But it was expected as dogs always end up dead in Hollywood movies. But while he's alive, the dog character and actor really do a solid job. The whole Russians as bad guys is getting a bit tired. Is it that hard to do something original in Hollywood?What is particularly interesting is the whole underground hit men culture. The safehouse/hotel, the rules, the cleaning crew and so on. Reeves is always likable even when all he does is shoot at people. But this movie has another thing going for it and that is Michael Nyqvist who is incapable of not giving a spectacular performance. You can just tell he gets a kick out of every role he plays. Looking forward to part 2.","

"YellowTea","1 January 2022","John Wick is a good movie, but that's not to say that it doesn't have its flaws. It's flaws are also more numerous than you might think (according to the author's humble opinion).Let's start with the positives:
Non-stop action.John Wick looks pretty awesome in his suit and with his hair slicked back.You do care for John Wick and his puppy.The negatives:
Cliches galore - retired ""professional"" with a badass reputation; main character loses wife and suffers flashbacks; rainy funeral scene; list goes on...
Unrealistic - the entire movie feels like a video game rather than anything resembling real life. The fighting is mostly cartoonish and so are the ancillary supporting characters (Perkins comes to mind). The choreography feels slow and deliberate at times, as though the actors are trying not to hurt each other. The guns feel weightless and are wielded more like fencing swords.The plot is rushed - the setup of the premise is very abbreviated and within about 10 minutes John's wife is dead, he's suffering from flashbacks, and his newly-received puppy is also dead.The takeaway:
John Wick is a good movie, no question about it. If action is your thing, then you'll probably enjoy it.I feel as though it's been done before many times and it borrows heavily from movies like Hitman. It's nothing unique, but it's a good thrill-ride.It's just a stylish revenge flick that'll get you through a lazy Friday.","

"bob-rutzel-1","10 February 2015","Mob hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) promised his wife he would quit the business and he does so for 5-years. Then she dies and for him not to be alone she had arranged for a Beagle puppy delivered to him at home. Then the son of mob boss Viggio (Michael Nyqvist) - who John Wick used to work for - wants his car ( a souped-up 1969 Mustang ) beats him up and kills the puppy. John Wick recovers and knows what he has to do. Let the games begin. Most hit-man stories have the hit-man (or a narrator) tell about his life and the specific numbered rules he lives by. And during the time of the movie, we will see this hit-man break every rule he has. This time it's different. This time it's pure revenge. We don't know the rules John Wick used to live by. But make no mistake about all this, now John Wick is out to make things rightÂÂÂÂhis way (get chills saying that?).To be clear we learn that everyone, including Viggio, is afraid of John Wick, but Viggio must protect his son from John Wick. The rest of the movie is a well-orchestrated choreography of gun fights. Some special effects regarding vehicles are included and are quite good. The cinematography in this gun-fest is also quite good. The music is non-stop heart pounding throughout. Hit-man Marcus (Willem Dafoe) is contracted by Viggio to take out John Wick. This is insurance in case Viggio's men don't get the job done. Keanu Reeves is the right actor for this movie. As John Wick, he doesn't talk much but his stares speak volumes (don't forget his guns too). In fact, I have always seen Keanu Reeves as the right actor for any movie he is in. After his character's beating when the car and the dog were gone I felt his pain and loss. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, not much.Rating: B","

I can't picture any other actor in this role, that's how good he is. My only complaint is there aren't enough explosions. The plot is silly but that's the point. It almost seems as if Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it. One gets that Tarantino vibe while watching. It's a perfect action movie with a few laughs thrown in between. John Wick is one bad-ass dude that you don't want to cross and he doesn't leave things unresolved. Eat popcorn, shut down your brain and you'll have a great time.","

"LloydBayer","29 October 2014","When was the last time you saw a good old fashioned action film? I'm talking about the type of balls-out carnage that existed much before the likes of Michael Bay's dependency on faux-pas image generation. Packed with style, energy, and blistering momentum, John Wick is not just a frame by frame restoration of old-school mayhem, its unrelenting audacity kicks the growing trend for watered down action in the groin. If it is action you want, action you get â no holds barred and thoroughly gratifying.Helming the film is David Leitich as producer and Chad Stahelski as first time director, both expert fight chorographers and stunt doubles from over two decades of action thrillers. The latter was also responsible for those genre defining action scenes in The Matrix trilogy, besides standing in as Keanu Reeves' stunt double in other films. Speaking of which, Reeves hasn't been in anything memorable since the aforementioned trilogy but returns to form as the titular mob assassin whose very mention irks jittery nerves from New York City cops to the Russian mafia and everyone in between. Mourning the untimely loss of his wife, Wick is brought out of retirement after crossing paths with his former mob employers. Not only do they steal his 1969 Mustang, they also kill his adorable puppy â a posthumous gift from his wife to ease her passing. Now what do they say about taunting a man with a short fuse and nothing to lose? With an arsenal of firearms at his disposal, Wick unleashes a bullet barrage and won't stop until mob boss Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) and his overindulged son Iosef (Alfie Allen) join the ascending body count.Although lacking a meaty story, Derek Kolstad's script might seem like yet another revenge film that glorifies characters with a 'particular set of skills'. Needless to say, characters with this skillset are on the rise and just recently we saw Denzel Washington open a can of whoop-ass in The Equalizer. Where John Wick differs is in its unapologetic approach as a violent revenge film with no room for dramatic twists and turns. This is also what makes the film fun to watch because all you have to do is take in the thickening layers of brutality following each wave of fluidly filmed fight scenes.With intense shootouts (a hefty dollop of which are gritty head shots) and close quarter brute force, the action rarely slows. If it does, it's during moments of straight-faced humour and Kolstad's strategic placement of supporting characters. Willem Dafoe and Adrianne Palicki play fellow assassins. One aids Wick while the other is contracted to kill him. In the neutral zone is Ian McShane who plays the owner of an upscale hotel that serves as a safe house for all assassins. It's a clever touch that says a little more about their profession and the unwritten code of ethics that goes with it. As an only perceivable downside, there isn't much emotion from anyone except Daisy the ill-fated dog. Then again, it's a snug fit for Reeves and the payoff is watching him live up to Wick's reputation of a stone cold killing machine. One scene even has Viggo reciting a verse that fables Wick as the bogyman himself. I'm thinking more along the lines of Keyser SÃ¶ze in the flesh. Wick-ed indeed.","

"KyleLicht","20 May 2019","This is an incredible action film. I was surprised by how enjoyable it is. It has heart wrenching moments, amazing fighting, great music, incredible cinematography and editing, spectacular acting, and among most cliche action movies, this was the most realistic. Also, the element of an ""assassin society"" is incredibly interesting and makes the film not only more meaningful, but makes the sequels more meaningful too. If it was a trilogy of the same revenge story with new villains, it would get boring. However, with the addition of an overarching element, things are more interesting.
Also, the film scores extra points for Willem Dafoe, David Patrick Kelly, and music by Marilyn Manson.","

"LeatherCajun","9 August 2020","Wow. I was not prepared for the badness and stupidity of this movie.The one actor/character who is not something of an embarrassment here is maybe the dog. The dog is the most believable character in this. And thank goodness he/she is here because the ONLY emotion in the entire movie is provided by the dog. And, oh boy, does Keanu prove the old adage to never play against dogs or kids. The dog totally upstages Keanu in this film.Every other actor/character is just unbelievable in every way. Dumb, shoot em up, everyone has plot armor on until the second the movie is ready for them to die.Ian McShane acts, a little, but he is playing one of those angel characters that is also completely unbelievable.I enjoy decent action shoot em ups, but just a tiny bit of believability. This entire movie is less believable than the Matrix, yet it is supposed to be in our somewhat real world. Depressingly bad.","

"adammcadam","5 May 2015","I really don't even see the point of this film, the plot is so stupid, basically a hit-man is retired, the son of the hit-man's former boss steals his car without knowing it was one of his dad's old employees.. so the hit-man is annoyed and it is now set in stone (for some weird reason) that the hit-man will be killing his former bosses son, even though he's presented as someone fairly cool/calm and not mental, so I mean you wonder why they couldn't just talk it out, the boss apologise, say his son didn't know, he will be punished, and compensate him for it. But no instead now this former hit-man gets all of his old weapons ready, the boss decides to send loads of assassins to kill the hit-man (already this is just really stupid) and it becomes some kind of boring boring revenge movie with the point of the revenge being stupid and one of the most easily avoidable and irrational reasons to go on a killing spree of any revenge move, where the hit-man is killing generic henchman after generic henchman who are sent in waves and really stupid, just there to die. So all the killing is kind of meaningless, it's not realistic or anything and you know these generic henchmen are just there to die before it's begun. So I don't know what this film even is supposed to be..","

"luiet","24 February 2015","We've all seen the guy getting whooped & coming back with a vengeance? This is that but so much more! Keanu, as always, shows his dedication to the maximum as ""John Wick""! Doing over 90% of the stunts himself? The fight choreography is ""A Ballet"" of Violence & the Stunt Driving, also mostly Keanu, is outstanding & professional! That's what separates this movie from the rest in the genre! Keanu is underrated as an actor in my opinion! His range in this film varies wildly & it's good to see him expand & broadening his talent! Willem Dafoe, is outstanding, no matter what he's doing or the size of the part! The best parts of the film is that they're always expecting him & nothing can stop him? He's a bad guy that's done very bad things but ""Got Out!"" As they say! After the death of his wife? He tries to put his life back together & expecting her death? She arranges a puppy be sent to him after she dies, which break him down, showing a new acting range Keanu performs without flaw! What follows? Must be seen? It would be a shame but expect a ""Dance of Beautiful Violence"" post puppy!","

"bravesfanc","4 February 2015","An ex-assassin loses his wife to cancer, her last gift to him is probably the worlds cutest dog. This lasts for maybe a day or two as a couple young punks break into his home, kill his dog and steal his car. Turns out the guys who did this too him is the son of his former boss. Now you learn throughout the movie that John Wick is known by just about everyone in town. So why this kid didn't know who he was is dumb but its what makes the story take off.John Wick is an action film that you need to just sit back, watch and enjoy. Don't nitpick at the little things. Such as the dialogue being a little bit corny, or the many clichÃ©'s that occur. This movie has fantastic gun fight choreography. In my opinion, its in the top 10 for gun fights. I also liked the world they created. The world of contract killers was different from what I had seen in the past.The good guy is a likable character and you feel for him. You also despise the bad guys especially the son. Bottom line, its a good time and if you like action films, I highly recommend it.","

"Gubby-Allen","26 March 2023","Not good, not bad. Just run of the mill shooting with a bit of fighting.I don't know why you needed to see, what ended as the final scene, at the start. It added absolutely nothing and to have skipped it, would have improved the film. Instead you spent the entire time, knowing how it would end up.It starts off ok, first 30 minutes sets is up very well, but then any character development or storyline is disregarded for endless shooting (of any men at all but no women) with a bit of fighting thrown in. There is next to know acting or dialogue in the latter half of the film. It was like watching someone playing a computer game for the last hour.","

"bustozoni","6 January 2015","Say you hate somebody who knows a bit about films, well, not that much. Buy him/her a ticket. You will never be forgiven . There is one thing that called my attention, PLOT DISPENSABILITY, no efforts were made in the making of this film to make any sense at all. This movie is a mere exercise of ""keanu kills them all, everybody but keanu dies"". There is some experimental value regarding film appreciation. DF has done a good job, the atmosphere in general makes the image appealing to watch. There are, at least, 10 things that don't make any sense; so it makes you wonder... Is the director challenging traditional film conventions? guess not.","

"tarekag","1 November 2014","The movie is just pure action. No story what so ever. The writers didn't do any effort to create any intrigue or suspense. The shift from the movie's lame beginning to the action was abrupt. Keanu didn't even prepare well for the movie. His body lacked the necessary muscles for such a super strong bad ass. Yet, he was hit so many times thrown off floors and he just gets up and continues fighting like it was nothing. I gave it 4 our of 10 because the action sequences were kinda slick. Totally unrealistic though, but still cool. And even still, the action sequences are repetitive without much change as the film progresses. Long story short, this movie has no plot, no logic, no hype, abrupt transitions, and a super hero with a white pasty body.","

"randomStuff101","10 June 2019","Way over the topy. Even when framed as pure escapist fiction, there's too many unlikely scenarios we're expected to believe.The main character somehow survives all those bullets, and dozens of bad guy clones.I avoided this 2014 movie until now (2019), and now I know why I didn't bother before. I knew it would be one of those movies where implausible action is ramped up to 11.The one thing I'll give it, is the photography. Very cinematic style. You keep watching to see what happens, but it's unsatisfying garbage, like a mediocre video game. I prefer more realism, even in brain-dead action revenge movies.Writers need to learn that piling up the body count, doesn't add value. Think of stuff to put in between the bodies hitting the floor.","

In the run up to the 4th movie I have decided to re watch the first 3 movies again, I have seen them a handful of times and I do really enjoy them !!! So I may aswell fire up a review !!John wick 1 was something very fresh in an age of action movies, what I believe drove it's success and appeal to an audience that seemed to grow and grow was the hand to hand combat, John using many different fighting techniques, weapons and all of it felt and looked so real, there were so many continuing shots and it's a testament to Keanu who performed the majority of his own stunts.The story is simple, his wife passes and leaves him a dog who ends up getting killed by a Russian thug who is the son of a high up Russian mobster. Believe me when I say it's not the story we show up for, it's nice to get it and in further movies we do, but it's the action.With so many comic movies and other action movies I can't think of many that even come close to these fight scenes, Netflix Daredevil would be the closest.I enjoyed most of this movie, not to gone on the last 20 minutes to be honest but overall it's a fantastic movie. 8.5/10.","

In one scene a woman infiltrates John's hotel room and a guy shoots his pillow to warn him, couldn't he just have shot the woman?And in the nightclub scene John gets thrown over a 10-foot tall balcony, and he barely has a scratch on him.Also, I think he's a bit of an unrealistic person, he can literally take infinite damage and his guns NEVER run out of bullets, I don't get it.But Willem Dafoe also gives a very good performance.And I'm gonna give John Wick an A-","

"pachl","24 October 2014","Let's be blunt: film snobs, along with many regular movie-going fans, think that Keanu Reeves' acting is, to put it mildly, a bit wooden. For those who thought he was a mediocre actor at best should see John Wick. It's proof Reeves has drastically improved as an actor.I read a ""professional"" review in which the film critic still lambasted Reeves' ""robotic demeanor"". That is absolute nonsense. I was so intrigued when I saw the trailer for this movie. Immediately it struck me that Keavu Reeves seemed to absolutely own this role. But that was just short outtakes. Could he really be that good in the whole movie?Easy answer: yes.John Wick is a revenge thriller. He's emotionally wounded from the untimely death of his wife from some undisclosed illness. The son of a Russian crime boss makes the tragic mistake of attacking John Wick and killing his dog. We have no idea up to this point that John Wick is legendary as a killer. Ruthless and skilled, everyone fears him.No apology is sufficient for what was done to him so he embarks on a mission to kill the crime boss' son. As always happens in movies of this genre, John Wick is always outnumbered by ten to one, and yet he kills everyone in his path to revenge and keeps moving forward.Although at the end there was some dopiness to the plot, Keanu Reeves was stellar. He was focused, not wooden. He was dynamic, not robotic.We've seen a younger Keanu Reeves do comedy. He had some great successes. We saw him in Dracula, and wish we hadn't. We've seen him in near-misses like A Walk In The Clouds, that failed in no way due to him (he was excellent) but in cheap, sappy plot points that tried to bring an emotional closure.Now we see him clearly back in the game. I would love to see Keanu Reeves do something risky now; maybe take a chance on a comedy. It's clear he is up to it. His reputation as an actor should greatly improve after this rock solid performance.","

"Jerghal","19 January 2015","John Wick is and old fashioned revenge movie -much like 'The Equalizer' is actually- but a lot more wicked (pun intended)! I think I don't have to explain how these revenge movies work: they (the character and the audience) need a reason to take/want revenge on the bad guys and then you can brace yourself for the violent killing spree that leads up to the main prize. What Keanu lacks in sympathetic warm charisma (like Denzel) he more than makes up in coolness and style. John Wick is just badass! The fights are excellently choreographed (Wick uses the Central Axis Relock System in combination with martial arts moves) and the gunfights are fast and furious. The overall design of the sets and costumes is very slick and stylish and the soundtrack also features some cool tunes. Although the script wasn't written with Reeves in mind, it does feel like it fits like a glove. John Wick wasn't a great box office success but I bet this will grow into a cult hit on DVD and Blu Ray. Do check it out!","

But if You Mess with a Man's Car and His Dog, well, there's just No Telling.Keanu Reeves is the perfect ""Actor"" for this Type of Thing. That is, a Character that is Myopic, Speaks in Short Stunted Sentences, and Never looks Distracted by anything requiring Thought beyond those Instinctive and Highly Trained Survival Skills.This is one of those that must be Applauded for Not Reneging on its Promise to deliver what You pay for. It knows its Target Audience and doesn't try a bit to Educate, Enlighten, or Expand Their Worldview. It Serves Up just what is expected and required to Not Disappoint.Thanks also for the R Rating. No Cop Out Fudging the Violence. That would have been a disaster. Just look at the ""Expendables"" Movies. When there is so Much Carnage On Screen and No Blood, or Heads Exploding, the result is a Dull Affair of repetitive Frolicking in Laughable and Lame Action Scenes.Not that this Thing is Trying to be Realistic. Far from it. It's Roots clearly Lie in First Person Shooter land, and there is about as much Dialog or Concern for Character Development as in a Video Game Shoot Em' Up.That's really All This Is and it makes No Apologies. There is the Added Treat of many Cameos by recognizable Character Actors and that Adds to the Fun. The Movie isn't anything that Special. It's just a Highly Competent and Enjoyable Ride of Revenge Flick Mayhem and requires You Bring Nothing more to the Screening than a Desire for Escapism.","

Ahhhh ð However he is forced back into the underworld by the son of a mafia boss who kills his dog.This son apparently not knowing who John Wick is, despite everyone recognising him, including a dumbstruck cop who turns up at John's house after he's shot an endless stream of baddies in the face.The one thing I liked in the movie is the Hotel/Club that seems to be an escape where baddies can go and the only rule seems to be that no ""business"" i.e killing, can occur on the premises. (Cue the inevitable killing spree on said premises)There's really nothing else to this film. It is laughable, with so many plot holes, but I can't stop watching a film once I've started so I ploughed through. Now I'm going to have to watch two sequels for closure.If you like mundane gunfights and people being thrown over shoulders then shot in the head........this film is for you.","

"ayoreinf","27 October 2014","I stated more than once over here that though I don't like comparing movies, sometimes a comparison is unavoidable. This is doubly so for John Wick. First is the almost automatic comparison with The Equalizer. Another retired professional killer forced out of retirement into an all out collision with the Russian mob, (boy, are they once again the popular bad guys in town). Well, despite some obvious casting advantages the earlier release has over John Wick, mainly as far as the leading role is concerned, The final result is working in favor of John Wick. It's plot is much more believable than The Equalizer's, it's fight scenes are way more real, look less like a choreographed ballet and more like a fight to the death, in which both sides are drawing blood.The second comparison I feel that I must make goes a bit further back, all the way to Eastwood's masterpiece Unforgiven. Another man with a bad past coming back to avenge a seemingly minor crime, this time not hired but much more driven and there a few other similar plot twists which I can't discuss without adding a spoiler. Once again we have a film debating the nature of evil, and when is evil not really evil, and John Wick doesn't do too badly in this comparison as well. I must refer to Keanu Reeves shortcomings as an actor. His range is well known as limited but he usually has a flare for choosing the right roles for his abilities, he does exceptionally well here, despite some early wooden moments at the very beginning of the film. The rest of the cast is superlative, apart from Michael Nyqvist, who's delivery in English leaves a lot to be desired. Yes the language should sound foreign in his mouth, but the emotions should still be there, and they often felt forced too me. The rest is very well done, the pace, the cinematography, all were right on the spot for the film. A proof that action flicks can be thoughtful and emotionally true.","

"hitchcockthelegend","5 April 2016","Keanu Reeves is the John Wick of the title, a grieving one man army who gets tipped over the edge when gangsters kill his dog. Carnage ensues.The paying public do like a good revenge flick, there have been plenty this last couple of decades, and they do go down well. Once the set-up has been staged - Wick grieves at the loss of his loved one - gets some small joy via a pet - only to have that snatched away from him, then the film becomes a joyously unstoppable actioner.Wick, in good hands with a moody and beefy Reeves (face fuzz strange, though) strong in presence, cuts a swathe through the gangland eastern blockers. And that's pretty much it! Characterisations are thin on the ground, it's a bit nutty and of course preposterous, but boy is it fun. There you go, a box office winning actioner without pretensions. Enjoy. 7/10","

"Uriah43","19 January 2017","""John Wick"" (Keanu Reeves) is a highly regarded hit man for the Russian mob who has gotten married and retired. Sadly, five years later his wife dies and he is overcome with grief. Anticipating the impact her death will have upon him, his wife makes one last secret arraignment and has a little puppy sent to him a few days after her funeral as a parting gift. Realizing the love behind the gift he immediately becomes attached it. However, one morning while walking down the stairs of his home he is hit on the head by a thug named ""Iosef Tarasov"" (Alfie Allen) and before losing consciousness watches as it is killed in front of him. Afterward, Iosef and two other hoodlums then steal his mint '69 Mustang and leave. That afternoon these same thugs take it to a body shop to sell but the owner recognizes who it belongs to and refuses to have anything to do with them. As it turns out, Iosef is the son of a Russian mob boss by the name of ""Viggo Tarasov"" (Michael Nyqvist) who becomes terribly upset at Iosef for what he has done and desperately attempts to make amends with John. Unfortunately, John refuses to talk and this results in Viggo sending a dozen men to kill him at his home. But John is waiting for them and none of them come back alive. And now it's his turn. At any rate, rather than reveal any more I will just say that I really enjoyed this particular movie and it kept me entertained from start to finish. I especially liked the performance of Keanu Reeves who essentially owned the role and provided a dominating presence throughout. In short, I thought this was a really good film and I have rated it accordingly.","

Other than this, the story is typical. You will predict the ending after 10 minutes.It's straight up Rambo up in here; guns blazing shooting everyone on sight. I read somewhere the Wick's body count was 84. This is a lot of people to kill in about 2 hours.I'm going to watch chapter 2 anyway.

"Mr-Fusion","23 March 2015","Keanu Reeves isn't the guy that seems suited for your usual revenge flick, but he works fairy well for ""John Wick"". There's an inherent detachment to Reeves for a good portion of the film, but he's also got that quiet brooding that roils beneath the surface.Probably the best thing about this movie are the action scenes, which aren't cut to shreds. They're well-staged and have a nice fluid brutality to them. Simple but effective.What was also really nice was the clearly defined (under)world with its coded language, currency ad protocols. It harked back to ""Payback"" and the mob-as-corporate-culture. Also, Wick had modern dress and domestic appointments (probably due to his departed wife), but he's using an old touchtone phone and getting around in circa '79s cars. Little touches that add character.It's great news that they're planning a sequel. They've already built the world, and I'm in for more.","

However, a major reason why he IS soo ""legendary"" is because of how lame and stupid the bad guys are. Technically John Wick should have died roughly four times in the movie but because the enemy were stupid or for the convenience of John Wick, he lives.Aside from that the action is not bad, Keanu did great, and the whole continental concept is interesting.

The acting was done well too. There were a few familiar faces from the small screen(HBO) as well. All of the characters were convincing and believable. John Wick(Keanu Reeves) is an ex-hit-man who is forced to come back to work to find the people who took everything from him. Like I said, it's simple but it's good.

And a huge comeback for the apparently never aging Keanu Reeves.John Wick screams cool, except he is actually a man of few words, and the coolest characters usually are. He has one of the coolest cars ever made, has great style, but most importantly he's second to none when it comes to dealing out death. The gun fighting these movies have become known for is incredible. I really enjoyed seeing the different martial art styles, especially judo.As the viewer we are introduced to this classy underworld of assassins that live by a code. This is of course delved into more during the sequels. The colour theme is mostly dark throughout it's entirety, other than flashes of neon as seen in the club scene. This is consistent with the sequels, and I love it.The first entry is superior to it's sequels. Sometimes less is more. This is easily in my list of top movies, and one of which I do not get tired of. Also comes complete with a fantastic cover.","

"thomas-w15","20 November 2014","John Wick: In the 90's and early 2000's, any action movie with Keanu Reeves was a must--see movie for all. In the past eight years or so, Keanu Reeves practically went off the map and no one knew if he was still acting anymore. Then, he suddenly decides to pick up where he left off and return to action. ""Everyone's been asking me if I'm back, yeah I'm thinking I'm back- John Wick."" With the plot of John Wick somewhat laughably mimicking the career of Keanu Reeves, we cannot help but enjoy the thrilling ride of seeing a solid action film.I do not usually give the plot of the film but I feel it is appropriate for this one. John Wick, a once great hit man, comes out of retirement from his peaceful quiet life to track down the men who took everything he had, showing he has not lost his touch at what he does. With the exception of trying to enact revenge on people who wrecked his life, that plot sounds a lot like Keanu Reeves's career. That is why I thought he was perfect for the role and why the role was perfect for him. I would have given this movie a higher rating if it was not for the fact that I have seen this type of movie many times before. In fact, John Wick reminded me a lot of a movie I saw a month ago called The Equalizer which has an extreme number of similarities with John Wick. If it was the first time I ever saw a movie with this plot, it would be one of my favorite films. Sadly, it is not the case and I never was really surprised with the direction the movie went.Enough about that, time to get on to why I still liked the movie. The main reason the movie is very enjoyable is because it accomplished what it wanted as solid action film. It did not try to do more or get overly complicated in it's own plot leaving the audience lost. It was clear-cut and direct, what many films are not successful achieving. There is no one is better to achieve it than Keanu Reeves. I am not sure if the script was written with Keanu Reeves in mind or if it was just cast perfectly. Whatever the case may be, the intimidating, quiet, resourceful guy pretty much describes Keanu Reeve's bread and butter role. The rest of the cast did their job accordingly, but Keanu Reeves definitely shines in his return to action films. If you are in a theater where they are showing both John Wick and The Equalizer, flip a coin and you will enjoy both of them equally. Still, I recommend you see John Wick at some point while it is still in theaters. For more of my reviews go to my website at reviewsbywest.com","

"pokemon_trainer_lucas","21 June 2019","Whilst the plot of this action movie was no different from many revenge films, the pure violence and gore in John Wick combined with the intense and fantastically choreographed fight scenes left me open-mouthed and full of adrenaline! There was just something new and thrilling about the way in which Keanu Reeves portrayed his character that left me in love with this film. I highly recommend it.","

"backup-50362","28 September 2021","...because I now know he's ready to take literally any cringey role in any terrible cringey movie. Just because this one turned out to be a commercial hit, doesn't mean it's because of him.I know he's said to be a really cool guy in real life, but as an actor he's done tons of mistakes, kinda like Nicolas Cage, after a point you can't really see him in a movie and get invested at all.And this is such a case. I couldn't enjoy this movie or see him as anything other than the pathetic emasculated loser in the quasi-feminist simp-fantasy-cringe movie Knock Knock now.Of course John Wick kills all the men but the women who betray and try to kill him he lets go. Of course he's a simp like that. How could a Hollywood movie not be so predictable?","

"Java_Joe","6 August 2019","Keanu Reeves has been called a lot of things but a good actor with range is not necessarily one of them. Don't get me wrong, I like him as an actor but he has a very narrow range in the roles he can accept. Either he plays the big, dumb doofus or he plays the loner of few words in those movies he can truly shine. And this has been shown time and time again. His dramatic roles? They tend to come off flat and stale. His attempts at accents? They tend to be terrible in every sense. But movies like ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"", the first Matrix movie or this one and you can see what he's really capable of.John Wick is the story of a hit man who's left that life behind. He wanted out but things force him back into it and he does not go happily. He's described as a man of focus, commitment and singular will. He never fails a job. He never gives up. And he once killed three men in a bar with a pencil. He's that much of a badass. We catch glimpses of another world where assassins get contracts, where there's hotels and services that cater to these people and where everything is paid for using gold coins. It truly gives the feeling that this is a fully fleshed out universe with history, a code of conduct and it's something happening just under our noses without us knowing.The movie itself is a work of art. Whereas in a lot of action movies there's a lot of shaky cam work and quick cuts to hide the lack of skill of the actor, this one goes the opposite way and shows everything. There are long shots of John Wick doing his thing. There's fight choreography that is just beautiful to behold in it's brutality and execution. Keanu trained for this and it shows.When you get down to it, it's a revenge flick but one the likes of which you probably have never seen before. It's Keanu at his best and with luck he will continue to make movies like this in the future.","

"ranblackman","28 May 2019","Fun, just fun. Not your typical action movie. Not messy like a lot of them are typically now. The fighting and gunplay is very smooth, yet also highly graphics and violent. The story, about a retired hitman seeking revenge over the death of his dog, is simple, but since Jon Wick is portrayed as a tragic, sympathetic character, its good enough. Reeves also turns in a surprisingly good performance. If nothing else, this movie deserves respect for its attention to detail. These filmmakers really know what they are doing, they craft and layer this thing with a passion that makes it highly pleasurable to view, right down to the subtitled conversations, being very in sync with whoever is speaking, to a degree that makes reading them faster. That's what this movie is, fast, quick, constant action, with a simple effective story and great performances, also with a passion and professionalism that makes it stand out from the rest. It has earned its spot as a milestone for the genre, based on that alone.","

"captainmike-michael","23 November 2014","This action adventure presents a simple, straightforward violence and revenge movie that does not offer any refreshing idea, but some creatively designed small elements in the gangsterism world and its political cultures however might surprise the audiences. John Wick is definitely portraying Keanu Reeves rather than the other way round who used to be expressionless or impassive, cool and less talking, and perhaps his personality and life experience might be the two important factors that make him suits perfectly in this character full with sorrow, miserable and anger. More than three quarters of the film are filled with stylish scores, adrenalin-rush and thrilling action art sequences captured in great angles and cinematography, but the emotional built-up and the relationship with the cute puppy in the beginning seems to be too short, pushing the film towards a slight monotonous ending.","

"KineticSeoul","3 February 2015","This is a sly, swift and stylish action movie that is actually a decent popcorn flick. Sure the plot isn't anything grand, but that isn't the core of this movie. A movie such as this needs a spark and how to go about it from there on. It isn't as adrenaline filled entertainment like ""The Raid"" or has a super well blended and enticing story mixed with action like ""The Raid 2"" but it'st still a pretty cool movie. And seeing Keanu Reeves kicking ass and taking names is just the bonus. Like I said the plot doesn't have anything that really stands out, but the stylish cinematography, choreography with enough cool action elements make this one worth at least one watch. Especially if you like action movies. However I could see why some audiences would not like this movie and why some people just wouldn't. You could really tell the directors got their ideas from past action movies, anime and video games. ""Max Payne 3"" really came to mind while watching this.7.5/10","

"Zulfmanauthor","1 February 2015","In today's day it is as hard to make a good action movie as it is to break box office records. Thrillers may be based on tried and tested formulate, but that is the reason why to bring something new and refreshing becomes harder and harder in this genre. 'John Wick' is a tale of revenge, a man with a violent past who is brought back to the life he left behind when he is brutally attacked and his dog is killed. The plot works because it doesn't try anything new, in fact it takes you back several decades to Lee Marvin in 'Point Blank'. Keanu Reeves's character of 'John Wick' is a throwback to Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson and every other bad ass who doesn't bother to say much but shoots instead. This in itself is refreshing, just a simple action thriller with no over-complicated storyline and ingenious twist. This movie is quite different to the other great tale of revenge released at the same time; 'The Equalizer', mainly because Keanu Reeves is a much different actor to Denzel Washington. John Wick is for the lovers of hard action and no frills!","

"bleecole88","23 January 2015","This movie has some of the best quotes I have heard since a Tarantino Movie. A past assassin who tries out a new life, of marriage, and bliss. When he looses his wife, and someone kills his only thing given to him from his wife before she died, he has to dip his feet back in the pond of chaos, and ends up taking out the whole Russian Gang of New Jersey to kill the bastard son and everyone infected with the curse of being related or working for the kids father, who is the Russian Mob Boss of New Jersey. Great Acting, Great Actors, and I noticed Keanu is doing a lot of his own stunt work in this movie, and had to do a lot of Close Combat Training for this movie, and future movies to come. I seen he stars in Knock Knock a recent Sun Dance movie just released, but Akira is the movie I am waiting to see him in. This movie is great, and keeps on you on the edge of your seat. Watch it to find out if he gets revenge for the person who took everything from him after he lost the only thing that mattered in his new good life.","

"russellingreviews","12 November 2014","Keanu Reeves has not offered the cinematic world much since The Matrix trilogy. Can John Wick reignite his impact? Walking into the cinema... John Wick has had a positive buzz, but is it enough to get people to the theatres? The appeal is seeing Keanu back in his wheel house. Films with short bits of dialogue, subtle humour and a multitude of action. Not since Point Break has Reeves had a role that looked so right for him. Overall rating: 3 stars Cinematic value: 3.75 stars Family value: 1.5 stars'Fortune favours the brave' English translation of John Wick's tattoo'Do not mess with a man's dog' is basic knowledge in film class 101. From Old Yeller to Turner & Hooch, the dog serves as the catalyst for some of the key events in film history. John Wick is no different. Wick's last gift from his recently deceased wife is a puppy named Daisy. She serves as a connection to his wife and as comfort during his grief. Through a chance encounter with the Russian mafia, he is robbed and without spoiling too much of the story, they mess with the dog. Which unleashes a tale of revenge and a horrific day at the office for the men who robbed John Wick. Call it arrogance or naivety, these thieves robbed the wrong guy. Wick only recently retired from being a hit-man. Wick was not just any assassin, but The Bogeyman, feared by the mere mention of his name. The thieves cause the emotional tipping point for him to unleash his revenge on the dark criminal underworld. The story takes Wick on a hunt for the men who 'took away his opportunity to grieve' and through the process, his past is revealed and the audience is introduced to the hit-man's hidden world. His target through most of the film is Iosef Tarasov played by Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones), who seems to have perfected the pathetic, elder son role in television and on the big screen. The unsympathetic character of Iosef seems to warrant the inevitable vigilante justice from his introductory scene. As with most revenge films, the believability of survival of the main character goes beyond comprehension, but it is an undeniable, guilty pleasure to experience. Keanu Reeves (Matrix) is the champion for the average man. He never comes off as too smart or fit, but is at his best with little dialogue and multiple points of action. This film happens fast and is over before you can consider the sheer lunacy of the concept. The debutant directorial team of David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, give Reeves the perfect storyline to capitalise on his strengths. Like all of the action in this film, they seem to understand that the best lines come quick, subtle and hit their mark. John Wick is a simple story of revenge shot against a dark, criminal landscape, but moves beyond the clichÃ©. Do not misunderstand, this film is exceptionally violent, but the actions of Reeves are projected thorough the film with a force that is fuelled by well drawn supporting characters. Michael Nyqvist, Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe manage well orchestrated dialogue and fill in the necessary back story to quicken the pace of the film. They allow Reeves to be the action lead and he is only required to deliver memorable one liners. The quick linguistic delivery adds the needed levity for the audience to catch their breath. The film deserves its rating due to violence and language, but it does open the door to many conversation points. John Wick wrestles with the love and loss of his wife. Opening a door into the raw emotion that occurs in the life of a spouse that grieves. The loneliness, love and anger spins together into a mix that is not healthy in this film, but warrants consideration and discussion. Should people be given allowance during a time of trauma of the magnitude? The other significant plot point that should be considered is 'The Code.' When the movie moves to The Continental Hotel, things get interesting. This is a world where hit men and women go for a place of neutrality. Winston (Ian McShane) is the owner and stresses the code that underpins this violent world. Only those within the system seem to know the code and understand the penalties for breaking it, but the bigger question is who is the one who determines the code and how should justice be enacted? John Wick is merely another revenge film, but even the simplest of stories can open the door for the bigger questions of life and could even fuel conversation for those who regularly attend these films. Leaving the cinema... This is a simple, but well made film. Cinematic simplicity is a fine line. The creators of the film have to determine what to add or take away for the effectiveness of a film. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not, but with John Wick it works. This was the right film to capitalise on Keanu Reeves strengths and was a fresh telling of a well worn story line. If you remember anything, don't mess with the dog!Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Is revenge the answer to injustice? (Psalm 37: 27-29, Romans 12:17-21) 2. What is biblical justice? (Psalm 7:9, Romans 3:5-6) 3. Who determines right and wrong? (John 3:19-21, Matthew 28:18)Please study the rating before going to see this film.

"bomars-494-480095","25 October 2014","I haven't seen no preview to it and went to see the movie based on the good reviews here on IMDb. - After I saw it last night, I've got to say that they weren't describing the movie at all honest. - That's why I decided to put out my view of the movie on here.It all starts and already falls with the poor script: some described it as a straight forward story. I just remained asking ""where is the d**n story?""What you get presented with in this movie is a - up until the end still - flat character, who is taking revenge for the loss of his dog shortly after the death of his wife, who also gifted him the dog. So this John is described as a professional with amazing focus and at the same time with great inner rage, why he ends up going for his revenge no matter the consequences. But the movie doesn't succeed in delivering this believable character combining both these extremes. He sometimes is forgiving and other times scrupulous. It doesn't add up... It rather gave me the impression, that he is ""nice"" to people, so they can come again later and make the movie longer. But so is it on the other side with the ""bad"" guys, too. Why are they sometimes ""nice""? I couldn't understand.If you though look from the prospective of the storytelling, it makes sense. It delivers more movie-time! There are a couple of scenes, where it became very obvious, that whatever was going on was for the single reason of prolonging the (rather non-existent) story.What remains most prominent of all this watching time is seeing many head-shots of faces, you can't really make out enough to have some kind of emotional response, other than the excitement of the fighting itself.I liked the music though. It's fitting to the excitement of this one man offense.I hope with this you can better decide for yourself, if it's worth your time and money.","

"michaelt281702085","13 March 2015","I hate movies which include dogs, because somewhere along the line that dog is going to get killed.I guess I'm a sensitive man, but at the beginning of this movie when our hero receives a present of a little spaniel dog from his wife who had died of cancer, this film took on heart, but it was all short lived, because the dog got killed by thugs who beat up our hero John Wick and then you hear the dog yelp and then you see the dog from it's back, lying dead by John Wick when he wakes up from his beating.John Wick the character has heart, he cries at his wife's grave side, I lost my own wife to cancer in September last year 2014, so I could empathize with the character.All in all this was a very good movie with excellently rehearsed fight scenes, very cleverly directed. But getting passed the doggy being killed, kind of spoiled it for me.","

"Figgy66-915-598470","10 April 2015","10 April 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - John Wick. If you are not a fan of gratuitous violence, blood and gore.....stop now, this film is not for you. However if you are a fan of the action/thriller genre with all of the above included the. I thoroughly recommend this film. Keanu Reeves has definitely matured, this film, although a little wandering at the beginning, was gripping stuff. Reeves plays John Wick, a professional hit-man who fell in love and retired. When everything is taken away from him he looks for revenge and with his reputation definitely preceding him, he systematically exacts revenge from those who must pay. This was set in New York, a city beautifully shot from above, at night, looking straight down. Wick's world is one with rules of it's own, and you just accept this story without wondering why the good citizens of New York are not getting their knickers in a twist about the bodies and car wrecks piling up. Elegantly written, these people simply do not exist and the story continues on regardless. It wasn't until the credits came up at the end that I realised that the film was produced in part by Eva Longoria (of Desperate Housewives fame). Not everybody's cup of tea but I'd definitely raise another Earl Grey.","

"Floated2","5 July 2015","After hearing about the surrounded hype of John Wick, one must have been decided to see for themself how the film stacks up. And for one, I believe the film lives up to its hype. Having been called the best or one of the best action films of last year- 2014, it really does deliver on action and what makes the film standout, is the style and visuals. We have seen many action films in the past years but John Wick delivers and standouts due to its level of non-stop action and the way the action is being brought upon us. There have been plenty of action films with characters such as John Wick- highly secretive hit- man/detectives that play it cool, but in this film we see Keanu Reeves really play the part perfectly.Like most films, especially like he Equalizer- another 2014 action film, this film has a great set up and it builds the suspension, but as the film gets past half way, it really does become a great entertaining ride. Like many, the action is a serious tone and it works well. The sequel will be very anticipated, and we all hope it delivers. Keep a steady eye out for it. We all know it will come upon us quickly.","

In the movie, we see how sad John Wick is when his wife and dog die, but what we are sad about is not the death of his wife and dog, but the grief of John Wick. I think if the movie had been a little longer, and if John Wick had spent a little longer with his wife and dog, maybe then, I could have cared more about those characters. That's the only minus I can say about this movie.","

Even though this film may not be as eventful as the others, it is still a really good movie, and an entertaining one, which can never hurt. Though, I do think it was the weakest one, which isn't anything to be ashamed of considering the two sequels are some of the best action movies of the 2010s.

"SquigglyCrunch","13 October 2015","I didn't expect much with this movie. Just another action film in which my easily impressed friend announced was his new favorite movie.Turns out, it was actually pretty enjoyable. Sure it doesn't have a deep plot or interesting characters, but it has a twist on modern action movies that I haven't really seen. I don't want to spoil anything, but it was actually quite humorous. I found the over-the- top-ness to be quite entertaining. The action is good, nothing special though. Typical action movie action. EXCEPT! John Wick reloads his gun! That's right, this action movie is not only creative, but realistic! Now that's a rarity in action movies these days. Overall, John Wick is different, and it scores points on that level. However, the ending was forced which really took away from the experience, and the action, plot, and characters really aren't anything special (except John Wick reloads), which is where it loses points. I understand that it's an action movie, but that doesn't excuse it from key points required in making a good movie. In the end, if your looking for a solid action movie, then John Wick is the movie for you.","

Even if i swallow the fact that Mr. Wick is doing impossible things during the entire film, the story about an ex hit-man that goes back in business for revenge is so thin, that it could have been told in 10 minutes instead of two hours. All the movie shows is a thousand ways how to kill someone, nothing else basically. Although nicely filmed, it's a big pointless yawn in the end. Keanu Reeves does his acting job much much better in the Matrix, and The action parts there are much more enjoyable. Waste your time on something with brains behind it. This lacks it completely.","

"amesmonde","18 January 2015","A grieving hit man after a series of unfortunate events goes about exacting revenge on his former boss' son.Since Rocky 4 the stereotype Russian bad guy films seemed to ease off, however, mirroring the politics of today there appears to be an increasing influx of bad guy Russians, Equalizer, Taken 3, Jack Ryan, Die Hard 5 to name just a few. Amongst the abundance of them comes John Wick with its on location feel and slick action sequences. Wonderfully directed by Chad Stahelski & David Leitch's with great action scenes and Derek Kolstad's solid dialogue Wick goes from one scene to the next exacting revenge on those who have wronged him. Its a fine straightforward affair without the quirkiness or humour of the likes director Guy Ritchie or Paul McGuigan. Stahelski delivers a straight up action thriller with hard hitting violence, blood baths through a hotel, church, cars and blood spattered clubs. Unashamedly from the shootouts to knife fights it oozes cool, complemented by the lighting, sound design, music tracks and score from Tyler Bates.The cast are unprecedentedly on form with Michael Nyqvist, Alfie Allen, Adrianne Palicki and memorable Willem Dafoe. Bridget Moynahan and Ian McShane cameo with John Leguizamo small part effortlessly stealing the cameo show. Keane Reeves is perfectly cast with his minimal dialogue and screen presence. Even with its dark tone it's more fun than the comparable excellent Equalizer. Yes, like all actions there's an obligatory Jason Statham/Van Damme-like showdown/fight off and John Wick is unavoidably reminiscent of Get Carter and Payback but as a revenge action it is as completely rounded as they come - recommended.","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","23 March 2017","In theory, ""John Wick"" shouldn't work. It's ""Taken"" with Keanu Reeves. It's the ""let's create a middle-aged action hero with unrivaled skills whose first name starts with J"" formula. And yet, director Chad Stahelski and writer Derek Kolstad take the very best of that formula and elevate it into art â undoubtedly one of the best American-made pure action movies of the 21st century.Keanu Reeves fits so effortlessly into this story as John Wick, a former hit-man who has just lost his wife to an illness. After having a random encounter with the son of a crime lord he once worked for, the young man decides to target Wick and attacks him in his home. More significantly, he commits one particular crime that pushes Wick over the emotional brink and back into the criminally underbelly from which he thought he'd walked away forever. The emotional plot device that launches this story out of canon might seem a little cheap, but it works powerfully well. In a way, Kolstad knows that we know the ""retired hero steps back into the ring"" trope so well, that he manipulates it to his advantage. We get behind our new anti-hero in a heartbeat. The cherry on that sundae comes in a one- word line of dialogue from crime lord Vigo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) when learns just who his son (Alfie Allen) has messed with: ""Oh.""The body of the film is R-rated bloody mayhem that combines martial arts with a shoot 'em up style, which results in a surprisingly satisfying combination punctuated by a plethora of kill shots to the head, a phrase I never thought I'd use in a movie review. The sound effects and spraying blood dust echo video game sequences; in fact, there's a scene in which Wick assaults a safe house that's cut with a guy in the safe house playing a first-person shooter game. It's a nice, well-executed and majorly self-aware juxtaposition.Stahelski also brings a graphic novel aesthetic to the film. There's a lot of careful shot composition and a dark color palette with different colored hues. The way he stitches together two scenes -- one of Vigo lecturing his son about his terrible mistake and the other of Wick going into his basement to dig up the weapons he's buried â has a distinct comic book vibe.Reeves has the perfect amount of quiet, determined menace to bring the part to life, but ""John Wick"" also drew some impressive talent in other venerated actors between Nyqvist, Willem Dafoe, John Leguizamo and Ian McShane. They lend so much legitimacy to the criminal fantasy world of ""The Hotel.""If all that weren't enough, the script does circle around some ideas about whether a person can change. As much forward thrust as the opening scenes give this film, Kolstad doesn't settle with it. It digs a little deeper into what really motivated John to get back in the business and proposes it might have been inevitable.""John Wick"" is a successful combination of style and storytelling, and it really elevates the very basic genre-level appeal of this type of action movie. It's unusual for a movie to be one of the last ones to the party (this party being all the films about middle-aged assassins seeking revenge) and be the one to make the biggest impression. That's the sign of a great action movie.~Steven CThanks for reading. Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more.","

"al_wilson2","25 January 2015","Forget all the Nancy's that want a movie with meaning. If you're looking to get some kind of emotional connection or value out of this movie, then this is not the movie for you.However, if you're a guy that ever enjoyed renting VHS or DVD action flicks with your pop, then THIS IS ONE THRILL RIDE YOU WILL ENJOY. Cool music from Marilyn Manson, as well as some techno, accompanies all the great action. If you like 'The Replacement Killers' or 'Running Scared' (Paul Walker flick, not the 80's movie), then you should enjoy this also.Keanu Reeves plays one serious bad azz, and could potentially become the next action star.","

"Vartiainen","2 December 2015","Keanu Reeves has clearly found his niche as a brilliant martial arts actor, playing the role of various action heroes executing flawless and beautiful fight choreographies, taking names, shooting bad guys, breaking a few necks, et cetera. Absolutely nothing wrong with that and this, his most recent action film, is definitely worth a watch for the visuals alone.John Wick (Reeves) is a retired assassin and hired gun, who has recently gone through an immense loss and is just getting back to his feet. Enter the son of a Russian mobster, young enough that he doesn't recognize this dark legend of the underworld. After an insult gone too far, John Wick once again feels the blood boiling within him and the rest of the film is pretty much nothing else but his one man war against the Russian mafia. And you know what? I don't really need anything else from the story. These kinds of revenge action films work because of their style and because of their characters. Sure, it's nice if the story has some surprising twists, but they don't really need it.In this case the movie definitely has style, bucket loads of it. The fight scenes are phenomenally well-shot, well-choreographed and well-executed. Especially the first few. The film also manages to build nice mythos around its world. Like the gold coins these assassins use to pay for everything, or the whole code of conduct they all seem to operate under. Wick is a legend in the underworld and it's great to see him casually nodding to other killers and having them lift their hats in return. Small things like that really deepen the world considerably and make it interesting to follow.Unfortunately, where the film falters a bit is the cast of characters. None of them are bad and most of them are played by talented actors, but they are pretty much text book as far as the writing goes. Stereotypical, failing to surprise and mainly there to move the plot from one action scene to another. Plus, while the actors are not bad by any means, none of them are what you would call A-list, with the exception of Reeves, and even he's a bit debatable nowadays. Well, okay, there's Willem Dafoe, but he's in a minor role.All in all John Wick is definitely worth a watch for all fans of action, especially if you're into the martial arts and gun-fu subgenres.","

"dierregi","6 August 2017","Not being a fan of action movies I watched this on TV, out of a mild liking for Keanu Reeves. I know he has a reputation as a bad actor, but at least he never tries anything he cannot handle.Reeves is John Wick, a super-assassin living in what I gather (or hope) is a parallel world. Wick ""retired"" to live with his wife but she died and left him a puppy as a goodbye gift.The premise of the ""retired professional' is one of the stalest in the movie world, such as the killer with a heart and we get both in this movie. Wick gets out of retirement to avenge the killing of his dog and the theft of his car. Obviously, it is no regular villain who angered him, but the reckless son of a Russian mega-mobster.Moving from his designer villa to the city of New York, Wick gets to stay in a luxury hotel called the Continental, where criminals must refrain from ""conducting business"" or else being ""excommunicated"" from the great criminal brotherhood.Wick's criminal pals are sympathetic about Wick's loss and also scared of him, because of his fierce reputation. Knowing that ""honor among thieves"" and criminal luxury world are bulls**t, helps rooting for Wick's revenge. It also helps that the villains are Russian mobsters and everybody knows the world can do without them.As in every action movie, one also knows that the hero is next to indestructible and that some preposterous fighting scenes will pave the way to a car chase sequence (or vice-versa). As long as you keep your expectations low, Wick will deliver. Reeves is predictably laconic and the world his character inhabits is suitably menacing and dark, a sort of lawless Gotham city.PS I did not see this threadbare plot as an opening for sequels, there being very little original material to carve out more stories, but unfortunately it happened... and it just went downhill.",NA
"Calicodreamin","20 July 2021","A mindless action film that has a great vibe and some bad ass action. Reeves slays (literally) as John Wick. The premise is simple, the characters well cast, and the action amazingly choreographed. The dark cinematography fits this film perfectly.",NA
"onlythusfar","30 January 2015","Forget that garbage, that came after T2 ! This is the REAL TERMINATOR 3 ! Another fairy tale about another indestructible KILLING MACHINE ! YES! The fantasy of every child or puppy dog, who ever suffered at the hands of a bully. Acting? Did ARNIE need to act? Other than being ARNIE? Yup! Keanu has the chops! No Austrian accent, but you can't have everything. He mows down the BADDIES, like they were ""Dumb and Dumber"". Great photography, great muscle cars, and a non-stop path of destruction. A deadly stare, that'll be the last thing the MEANIES ever see! Is it realistic? Of course not! It's a DREAM. A real BAD DREAM if you F*CK with the ""Bad Man's"" puppy. Rated #1 by the SPCA.",NA

"tangojazz","30 November 2014","It's Keanu Reeves greatest movie, ever! I can't believe how many people Keanu (John Wick) killed in this movie! Maybe 80 or more, I lost count. And over a dog! Yes, Keanu as the Anti-Christ, the most evil out of the evil, a destroying hell's angel, a veritable force of nature! Never have I enjoyed cheering on the bad guy (John Wick) so much. And it's also how he did it! Sometimes shooting the 80 or so bad guys each two or three times in the head and chest (John Wick had a lot of ammunition). I have not seen this much raw, explosive action in a long time. ""John Wick"" felt like an amped up version of the Arnold Schwarzenegger action movies like ""Commando"" or ""Raw Deal"" but even more so! This has to be the most nastiest, nihilistic, existentialist, insane, outrageous, ironic, comedic, repellent and vicious action movie ever made! Guns, guns or more guns. It might make you throw up! And unbelievably, it might also make you laugh! There's also some great acting in this movie, by the way, from people like Willem DaFoe and Ian McShane.This also has to be the most Anti- Russian movie America has ever made. Russians left and right are being killed by the bushel full! So go see ""John Wick"" now, if you've got the stomach for it. And treat your pets with kindness, or John Wick will hear about it! Finally, what would John Wick do to Batman?",NA

"scottyxl","30 November 2014","I thought this was going to be just another movie where the main character has to kill all the bad guys to get to the main bad guy. While I was right about this, I did enjoy it a whole lot more than I originally thought.The start of the movie is a bit fast, you get to know everything you need too but without much details. The acting is okay but when the action starts you don't care about this anymore. Most of the action scenes are really cool and some of the gun fighting scenes are just awesome! For a Hollywood movie its actually quite realistic, you can see Keanu's training for The Matrix is still in his muscles. The main plot is not that special but some side plots are really nice. Humor was a big part of the movie much to my surprise, the entire room was laughing quite a few times.For a one-guy-kills-all-the-bad-guys movie this was really good and that's why I'm rating it 7/10.",NA
"fahad_iqbal_khan","17 January 2015","Gone are the days when you could trust the internet ratings on rotten-tomatoes, IMDb.. hell even Wikipedia entry is so wrong about its ""reception and critical acclaim""..This is one of the worst movies ever. It's a shame.. IMDb ratings. Movies like these will keep coming out and rigged ratings will keep earning them money. Hollywood is losing it.. Do yourself a favor, and do not watch this garbage. The positive reviews on this website are so clearly made up by the possible stakeholders.. Maybe the producers nowadays are hiring marketing teams whose jobs are to make multiple IDs and post as much positive reviews and ratings on sites like these to fool the public.. and guess what it sells.. some of the positive reviews are so clearly typed by the same fingers.. it is a shame.",NA
"puttypaws","17 April 2015","A lot of video games have been influenced by films - the plots, the characters, the framing, the cinematography. And increasingly a lot of films are now influenced back by video games - the plots, the characters, the framing, the cinematography. And so it is the case with John Wick.It's set in a world where everyone seems to be a gangster or an assassin, or a formal part of that world. It's all rather cold and detached. There is the flimsiest of back stories but it mostly consists of a very wooden Keanu Reeves shooting people in the face, sometimes stabbing them, and of course the obligatory 'throwing people through sheets of glass'.The whole point of a video game is that you control the character. Even if the game consists merely of killing people, the fact that you are controlling them makes it an immersive experience.Just passively watching a wooden game character shooting people in the face, sometimes stabbing them, and of course the obligatory 'throwing people through sheets of glass', makes for a rather pointless and tedious 101 minutes.",NA
"Aaron1375","4 May 2015","My parents own the DVD I watched of this movie and I borrowed it from them. It took me forever to watch it, but now I am happy to report that I have viewed the film so now I can return the copy back to my parents. It turned out to be a rather good action movie as well kind of in the same vein as the Punisher films and the film Dredd. Lots of action, a lot of bloody action that is. This film is almost non stop action as the set up of this film is very brief before it introduces us to John Wick's dark side and the insane criminal world he lives in. Granted, it seems as if this film was based on something as there were a lot of rules in this criminal world that seemed almost like we, as the viewer should already know, but I do not believe it was based on a book or graphic novel.The film starts out with John Wick (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) looking in rather rough condition and then we spend the rest of the film finding out what happened to put him in the place he is. His wife recently passed and after a very unfortunate turn of bad luck and timing he must go after some people that have wronged him. He will have to take on former allies as he wages a one man war against the head of a criminal family.Keanu Reeves does a good job as the title character and he apparently put a lot of work in training wise to play the man with special skills. The other cast members do a good job too, but the only other recognizable ones were only in the film for brief periods. I thought the film was going to be devoid of humor, but it had some moments here and there as it was funny to see how quickly people were to let John Wick off the hook as they had no urge to cross him.So all in all a good film as it was a bit of a super violent action flick...something the last Expendable film failed to be. It did not hold back on the violence, but I am a bit surprised that there was no nudity as I was sure there was going to be some in the couple of clubs that John came across. It does use computer blood, unfortunately, as it seems they must use computers for even some of the most basic special effects these days. However, my complaints are few as this one kept me entertained throughout.",NA
"inxsfett","23 November 2014","I know i know we all ready see this kind of movie hundred and hundred of time (moslty the are bad movies) so you ask What this movie have different of the others?...simple.All the action you see in this movie is completely justify believe me...this time the revenge is not about women or kids or jobs or betrayal or money or something like that...This time the revenge is about a PUPPY.Yes you read right a puppy.The story is very simple and i not gonna tell you because of that...Now you can see that all that Wick do for the puppy is completely justify because is the only thing he cares and loves in his life.Now another movie of this kind came out this year named THE EQUALIZER (based in the TV series) with Denzel Washington.Now don't get me wrong Washington is a great actor but see it kick ass and bing bang guns you simply don't believe it because in not the kind of actor for this kind of movies.In the other hand we had Keannu Reeves...Maybe he's not Stallone or Statham or Willis or Gibson or The rock but he is NEO and this movie probes that is still in shape and kicks everybody ass in a great way.See the movie you wont be disappointment at all...You really glad that john Wick kick everybody ass because what they done to the puppy...You gonna out with a great smile when the movie ends and for me...Is one of the best movies of the year.",NA
