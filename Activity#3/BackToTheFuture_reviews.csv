"TheLittleSongbird","15 April 2010","I love Back to the Future. While having a typical 80s feel to it, which I like, I love how fun, irresistible and original the film is. The special effects are dazzling and the comedy is suitably sly and sophisticated. Helping along the way is a script that is pretty ingenious, the sort of script that has quotable lines and also pokes fun at 1950s icons and lifestyles during the frequent bouts of time travelling. The score by Alan Silvestri elevates the sense of fun to a greater level, the main theme is one of the most memorable themes ever in the history of film, or so I think anyway. Robert Zemekis's direction is very good, and the cinematography, scenery and costumes are also excellent. And I have to mention the acting, Michael J Fox is really appealing in the role of Marty McFly, the role that propelled him to stardom, and Christopher Lloyd is brilliant in one of his most memorable roles(and yes this includes Judge Doom from Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Professor Plum from Clue). Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are also great. Overall, brilliant film that is good in so many ways. 10/10 Bethany Cox","

"Chrysanthepop","29 July 2008","Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic state. The 80's saw a lot of excellent original fun 'young' films like 'Back To The Future' (of course), 'Better Off Dead', 'Heathers', 'The Breakfast Club' etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.Back to 'Back To The Future'. This one is sheer fun, even today. There's an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an 'innocent' film. The music is very effective. It's slick and follows a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it's brainless entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex's story.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It's over 23 years old and it still hasn't gotten old. Sadly, they don't make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them. That's why they're classics.","

"Anonymous_Maxine","1 June 2000","Back To The Future is such an inventive and exciting piece of filmmaking that it is impossible to forget about it. The casting of every character involved was absolutely perfect, and the performances were spectacular. I first saw this film when I was six years old, and it is the only movie that I know of that I don't think I could ever get sick of.
One of the best things about Back To The Future is that it really makes you think. You can have in-depth conversations about the plausibility of the story-line and spend hours discussing the film. The story is awesome, it is delivered cleverly and entertainingly, and the movie as a whole is just so much FUN that it can be forgiven whatever number of time-travel discrepancies that may be found in the plot. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I have never found a movie other than this one that provides such a huge dose of great fun, and it has the desirable quality where you are able to see something new each time you see it. The only problem is that they stopped at part III.","

"mm-39","28 November 2004","One of the last movies I went with sister to see back in 86. The film blew my mind. My friends never wanted to see this one. I was happy I went. Many year's latter, I bought ""Back to the Future"" at Mc Donalds for $2.99 or for some other low price with a meal. The film ages well, and I love it just the same. The director and screen writer mixes science fiction, humor, and action perfectly. A big component of the script is time line theory which drives the story. Marty has many problems to fix, and finds out more than anyone wants to know about their parents. Michael J Fox and Christopher Loyd were excellently casted. Marty and Doc what a chemistry. With the film series one see the many dualities with time travel, that become a constant with the movie. The town clock, being awoke in a strange place, and letters. Keep this in mind when watching the 2 other sequels. The theory that time repeats itself is evident. What a time machine, the Delorian adds to this movie. Worth watch over again. 10 out of 10! Thank you TBS for showing all 3 films.","

"ivo-cobra8","17 April 2017","What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award ""- winning team of Steven Spielberg"" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A Modern/Classic Masterpiece! ""","

"BA_Harrison","20 November 2010","My DVD of Back To The Future is like my own personal time machine: I hit play on the remote and I'm instantly whisked back to 1985, when hair was big, fashion was fugly, films were fun and I was a mere 17 years of age with my whole adult life ahead of me.Nostalgia certainly plays a big part in my continued enjoyment of the film, and was clearly at the forefront of the minds of producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis, who delight in recreating the 50s of their youth, but the film is much, much more than a simple trip down memory lane: it's a rollicking adventure, a charming love story, and a brilliant comedy, with a career-defining performance from Michael J. Fox as time-travelling teen Marty McFly, fine support from the lovely Lea Thompson, quirky Crispin Glover and crazy Christopher Lloyd, amazing special effects (for the time) from ILM, and a rocking 80s soundtrack.A wonderful film that is as fresh and entertaining today, despite its inescapable 80s style, I have no doubt that Back To The Future will continue to captivate audiences young and old well after my generation is history: my kids sure loved it, and I hope that when they have kids of their own, theirs will too. And theirs, and theirs, and theirs...","

"Leofwine_draca","9 May 2016","I admit to having grown up on 1980s films and thus having a special admiration for them. Whichever way you look at it, BACK TO THE FUTURE is one of the most intelligent of the Hollywood blockbusters from that era, a film which perfectly merges crowd-pleasing entertainment with a complex and well-written storyline that gets to grips with the thorny subject of time travel.The underrated Michael J. Fox stars in the role of his life as Marty McFly, a guy who unwisely gets involved in time travel thanks to the machinations of his kooky inventor buddy, Doc Brown. Christopher Lloyd essays this subsidiary character and, again, it's the role of his life; he's over the top in it but nonetheless his character is thoroughly endearing and never less than hilarious.The time travel aspects of the storyline are carefully worked out and hold together very well even today, some 30 years after release. What I particularly liked about this film is the calibre of the writing: there's no slow spots or simplicity here, just one suspenseful sub-plot after another. There are small moments, big set-pieces, cutting edge special effects, action, chase scenes, romance, and of course plenty of humour, and a quirky supporting cast who make the most of their roles. BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic - and for good reason.","

"gavin6942","19 November 2014","A young man (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent thirty years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his friend, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), and must make sure his high-school-age parents unite in order to save his own existence.After almost thirty years (2014), this film loses none of its charm, and actually gains respect. The movie has had such a strong impression on everyone, whether they have seen it or not, as it completely permeated pop culture.The script is genius, not only how it parallels 1955 and 1985 (some of the references are dynamite), but how it set the scene for the sequels (despite allegedly not intending to have any). This is just one clever gag after another, and may require repeated viewings to catch them all.","

"george.schmidt","27 February 2003","BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) **** Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson, Marc McClure, Wendy Jo Sperber. This generation's ""It's a Wonderful Life""?  Think about it.  Very popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with tv's ""Family Ties"", casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney).  There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish.  High-concept hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis.  Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were different...see what I mean.  Oscar-nominated song ""The Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film.  Classic.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","3 February 2023","Back to the future is the ultimate 1989's movie, if you're feeling nostalgic, or simply want to experience the flavour of the decade, then this is the movie for you.A young Michael J Fox is sent back to 1955 by his friend, Dr Emmett Brown, his very existence threatens his own future, he has to fight for life as he knows it.It's super fast paced, it's one of those movies that simply flies by, it's fully of action, full of laughs, it's very much the 80's poking fun at the 50's, the free and carefree lifestyle of 1985 showing how things have changed in three decades.Wonderful special effects, lots of pyrotechnics and action sequences to enjoy. The music is wonderful, you'll be singing along.The acting is superb, Michael J Fox is just great as Marty, Christopher Lloyd is awesome as the wild eyed Doc.I would say it's the perfect Boxing Day film, but it's one of those awesome movies that you'll enjoy any time, and with the whole family.A fabulous movie.10/10.","

"Big Movie Fan","4 June 2002","Time travel movies never disappoint-that is because the concept of time travel is a very interesting one which most people must have thought about at one time or another. What would happen if you went back in time and an innocuous act changed the course of history for better or worse? It's something to think about.I won't reveal any plot details for this movie because it will spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Let's just say that Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ends up back in 1955 where a sequence of events inadvertently orchestrated by Marty threaten his very existence. He is aided by Doc Brown played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd who tries to get him back to 1985 without causing any damage to the fabric of time.The movie is great-and I feel it can be enjoyed by anyone regardless of their individual tastes in film genres. In fact, I find it hard to believe anyone could dislike a film like this. It has action, adventure, plenty of humour and some cool moments. All the actors involved in the movie play their parts great.Anyone who watches this movie will love it.","

"hannahsutcliffe","21 July 2015","As a child, I used to watch this movie religiously. I loved the chemistry between Doc Brown and Marty McFly, I loved the all too familiar soundtrack and the ridiculous way in which George McFly laughs. This movie has become such a nostalgic and feel-good film for me. I had the good fortunate to see all three 'Back to the Future' movies in cinema last year and it was such an experience to watch this timeless classic with people who enjoy this film as much as I do. Everyone has to see this film at least once in their life! Such an amazing, funny Sci-Fi from the 1980's. I just can't get enough of this movie - it will just never get old. Cannot recommend it enough!","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","1 December 2006","I just asked my friend that I'm speaking with through instant messenger if he had ever seen ""Back to the Future"" and he said ""Yeah, who hasn't?"", sadly, I never had the opportunity until tonite and he called me a failure as a movie buff, well, at least I've seen the movies now! Ha ha! I'm back on track! Well, obviously, this is my first review for the first Back to the Future and when I came her to IMDb, I knew this was a well loved movie, I was just amazed at it being on the top 250, but I can't give it a lower rating because Back to the Future was an excellent film that was ground breaking for it's time and still today.Marty McFly and his good friend, The Doc, are two science nuts. Marty isn't really happy with his home life and the fact that he and his parents are very square and strict, The Doc calls Marty and shows him his latest invention, his De Lauren that he built into a time machine. When the government go after The Doc and Marty has to get away, he jumps in the car and goes back to the year of 1955, when his parents met. Instead of the way his mom and dad met happening to his dad, he ends up being in the position and mom ends up falling for her son, not even knowing! But he has to make sure his parents are together in time so he can get back without altering the future.Back to the Future to this day is still a timeless treasure that I notice more and more is becoming part of a newer generation. Michael J. Fox should be proud, his work will be remembered for a long time. Back to the Future worked so well because of the great story and the humor was great, the whole cast worked together and made a terrific movie that will be looked back on thirty years from now and still be considered cool.10/10","

Views of the same scenes from different angles, different perspectives and different timelines abound.Fun for the entire family.","

"ironhorse_iv","21 July 2014","Synchronize your watches! If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88mph, you're gonna see some serious s***. Directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, this movie will forever remind me of what good-feel movie is supposed to be. The movie is about a teenager from 1985, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whom is sent back in time to 1955. While, he was there, he meets his future parents in high school and accidentally becomes his mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson)'s romantic interest, causing a time-rip. Marty must repair the damage to history by trying to get his parents to fall in love, and with the help of scientist Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd), while, also finding a way to return to 1985. I love the fish out of water history time-travel comedy, with the high-stakes action scenes. It was very entertaining. I love how the film has its running gags, and inside jokes of historical pop culture events; of Robert Zemeckis's work, and what was happening in the 1980s at the time. The movie has everything for every audience member, at the time. While, most movies were risqué and adult-aimed at the time; this movie balance it, enough to make it watchable for both family and single house-hold settlings. Parents went to go see it for nostalgia reasons. While the movie is mostly set in 1950's, it's truly a mark of the 1980's. I have to give the movie props with its controversial movie dilemma, with the Oedipal relationship with his mother. In any other movie, this might be tasteless, and turn people off, but Back to the Future made it work. I can also buy that, teenager Marty McFly would be friends with an older mad scientist, Doc Brown without it being creepy. Both have this father/son relationship that I love from this film. Mad praise to Christopher Lloyd for creating this character for his own. I can't see, anybody besides him. The production was indeed challenging. There were some changes that help the film, a lot. First off, is the title of the film, the film was almost call, 'Spaceman from Pluto'. Gladly, somebody came to their senses, and went back into the title, 'Back to the Future'. Another is that, while, Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty McFly, but he was committed to the show Family Ties. So they hired Eric Stoltz. I wouldn't say, Eric Stoltz would be awful in the movie, but indeed, Michael J Fox was the best choice for the film and they wait on production, until Fox's schedule opened up. The supporting cast is well-acted. Crispin Glover that played George McFly got all George's nerdy mannerisms, right. Lea Thompson is just amazing, and beautiful actress to play Lorraine McFly. Thomas F. Wilson as the bully, Biff Tannen was just hilarious. Every scene with him, made the film, so much better. You'll love to hate him. The set use for the film is one of the most famous movie backlot, previously being used in such works as 1962's To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1960's Inherit the Wind, and others works. The movie had a pretty good pace. There weren't a lot of slow or boring moments. Maybe, the beginning, it does take them, forever to get the time travel part of the film. Eight minutes were cut, including Marty watching his mom cheat during an exam, George getting stuck in a telephone booth and Marty pretending to be Darth Vader. Thank God, they cut the 'Nuking the Fridge' idea. An early draft of the Back to the Future script saw Marty travelling through time in a fridge and being caught in a nuclear bomb detonation. Spielberg would later use this in 2008's Indiana Jones & Kingdom Skull. Zemeckis almost cut out the ""Johnny B. Goode"" sequence as he felt it did not advance the story, but the preview audience loved it, so it was kept. The visual/special effects are just ground-breaking for the time, and it's just beautiful to watch. The opening scene, flawlessly sets up the film's central themes of time and space, provides heaps of exposition. The music by Alan Silvestri is emotional, epic and intense music. It's give the feel of two friends alone, fighting alone against two of the greatest forces ever know to humanity; time and fate. About Huey Lewis and the News, ""The Power of Love"". It's a product of its time. It doesn't hurt or help the film. It's just there. I do love the 'Earth Angel' song. It's romantic as hell. There are some nitpicks that I could focus on, like the time-travel plot-holes, but trying to understand the logic of all the time travel paradoxes, would take you out of the movie, and give you a headache. It's not worth it. Still, how his parents never find out that Marty McFly look like the kid, Calvin Klein from their childhood? Other faults of the movie are, the Pepsi product placement and its over used clichés. The movie also one of those films that would audience would see anything in it, as people see symbolism from 9/11 tragedy, JFK assassination conspiracy, Aliens, and others. Others see the film, themes taken from ancient and spiritual myths such as Kronos vs Zeus, the Bible, and others. One thing, it did influence is the skateboarding culture. The movie occurred during the 1980s infancy of the skateboarding sub-culture. The film was such a success, that it create two sequels, 1989's 'Back to the Future Parts II' and 1990's 'Back to the Future Park III'. It also create an animated series, theme park ride, several video games and a forthcoming musical. As with all great movies, Back to the Future, has stood the test of time. It never gets old. Overall: Power up the DeLorean, turn the time circuits on and get the flux capacitor! Where we're going, we don't need roads.","

"Angry_Arguer","3 July 2003","Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself.  Unlike such notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day, there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and cash-in on its success. This is due to the near flawless script.  Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're guess is as good as mine.  Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally difficult.  I'd know.The film starts slow, and gradually accelerates as it progresses.  You could almost call it a Jerry Bruckheimer movie for kids with Spielberg's trademark nostalgia.  The characters themselves are typical stereotypes for a movie like this and none of them, not even Marty himself, gel with potential.  In some ways it's as if MAD magazine made the film in an attempt to be serious.With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if George Lucas was involved.Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality, even if it created most of our time-travel cliches.  4 out of 5 stars.  Well worth your time.","

"SmileysWorld","16 September 2001","I feel that there is no such thing as a perfect film,but in today's cinema,""Back to the Future"" comes amazingly close.It has laughs, AND thrills,always a great combination.I am amazed at the attention paid to nearly every single detail here.For example,at the start of the film,Doc and Marty are in the parking lot of the ""Twin Pines Mall"".Then,shortly after Marty arrives in 1955,he accidently runs over one of old man Peabody's beloved pine trees.Toward the end, after Marty returns,the name of the mall changes.This is something you just don't notice until you see the film several times as I have. Excellent casting,particularly Christopher Lloyd as the unforgettable Doc Brown,the humor of the Ronald Reagan bit and the Johnny B. Goode sequence,along with the ultimate heart pounding ending and the attention to detail as I mentioned make this film as close to perfect as you will see in modern cinema.The sequels? Forget them.This is the only one of the trilogy you need to see.","

It is the ultimate feel good movie, the weed overcomes the bully, the dreamers wishes come true and all because a nosey old bird thrusts for a nickel ""Save The Clock Tower!""It's popularity spawned 2 sequels and although it got decreasingly good in terms of quality as a film, Back To The Future remains the best film in my repetoire and a safe bet when you need to feel good.It gets a solid 9 out of 10, comedy, fantasy, the gorgeous Lea Thompson, the insane but comic Doc and the typical teenager Marty make this film a must for all young at heart.","

"spyder7","23 October 2005","I watched this movie again for about the seventh time after a 10 year lapse or so. If there ever was magic on screen, Back to the Future has it. By the end of the film, I was only thinking, ""Wow, Hollywood was once capable of putting magic on the screen."" It really makes you wonder if the best of Hollywood is behind us.To summarize a few components of the movie: The storyline and plot are superb, even with the minor plot holes. The acting is spot on in every scene. Today's film editors should watch this film a hundred times to see what editing should really be like, nearly flawless. The direction is unbelievable in my opinion. The screen writing and script are perfect as well and will make you laugh and smile throughout the movie. Every line by the awkward McFly family, every crazy rumbling of ""Doc"", and even the cheesy bully taunts of Biff fit together so well.When I sat down to watch this movie a few days ago, I expected to see an aged movie that I remembered being much better than it actually was. I'm so glad I was wrong.","

"DMP-2","11 January 2007","When you talk about Back to the Future, you have to talk about the whole trilogy. Because Zemeckis and Gale didn't make sequels they extended the length of one film, which is very different than a sequel.The ultimate film must allow the audience feel part of the film and relate to the characters. This film is the best because it takes a fantasy story and makes it adaptable to real-life. I don't know how soon anyone will be able to time-travel, but you can relate to Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) reaction to the change. Even if you're not a teenager you can believe it in someway. Back to the Future is the perfect and its been extended into a masterpiece with 2 sequels or extensions as I see it. Definitely a must see, if your pathetic enough not to have seen in at least the last 8 years.Amazing story by Gale and Zemeckis. Great acting especially by Michael J. Fox, but also great work by Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and Tom Wilson. Such an exciting an involved story.","

"Hitchcoc","15 July 2014","Lots of tongue in cheek. Some great characterization. A chance at redemption. These movies showed Michael J. Fox to be a wonderful comedic presence. It is sad what happened to him, but can there be a more impressive example of a person who has overcome the tribulations that life has given him. Whenever I see him in ""The Good Wife"" as the slimy, underhanded character lawyer he plays, I love that I can ""not like"" a man who is dealing with devastating Parkinson's. As the principle character in this movie, Marty is shoved from one situation to another in a time he only can guess at. He has to face the youth of his father, a febrile wimp who gets pushed around. Then, of course, there is the wonderful Christopher Lloyd as the professor. While one could never accuse this film of being true science fiction with all the implications of time travel, there is a kind of suspense that works very well. It's pure fun and is the best of the three films in my opinion.","

"mjw2305","15 January 2005","Time travel is a difficult subject to cover in a movie, but Spielberg pulled if off with the Back to the Future trilogy.Michael J Fox in his finest role as Marty Mcfly and Christopher Lloyd as Doctor Emmett Brown make an unlikely pair, then again a DeLorean makes an unlikely time machine, so i guess it doesn't matter.OK so there are some plot holes (Marty the youngest Mcfly, dissapearing from the photo last) for example, but the overall impact of the film is so entertaining that bigger plot holes could have been allowed and the film would have been just as good. It's hard say why this movie is so great, or why it still looks as good as it does, even by modern standards (don't forget this is 20 years old) but if it has escaped your viewing then just see it as soon as possible and i'll bet you'll want to see the rest of the trilogy the second you finish watching it.I think it's just entertainment in its purist form.A big 9/10","

"JudgeChaos","8 May 2015","When I was little, my mom bought this movie on DVD for my dad. He turned it on one day and I brushed it off as ""one of those weird old movies daddy likes"". Eventually, I came out, sat down, and watched it. And the rest was history. I was so in love with this movie, that for 80's day at my school, I dressed up as Marty McFly. Nowadays, I love the movie more than ever. My favorite thing about this movie is the relationship between Doc and Marty. Most of the time, when a kid or teen hang out with an older person in movies and TV, people think they're more than friends. How many jokes have you heard involving Batman and Robin's relationship? However, Marty and Doc's relationship is pure friendship. I'm really good friends with one of my drama teachers, so I know how strong that type of friendship is. What else can I say? I love everything about this movie! If you haven't seen this movie, go see it now. Like...right now. Stop what your doing and go see it.","

"hitchcockthelegend","14 November 2009","It's 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future - a film about a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn't capturing the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice anyway but couldn't get a release slot from shooting with Family Ties. Luckily the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play Marty McFly as well as work on the show - the result of which would turn out to be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era.It's honestly hard to find anyone who seriously doesn't like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it's a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It's a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty's 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually. Alan Silvestri provides a whirring & pleasing score and the theme song, The Power Of Love, by Huey Lewis & The News, is infectiously enjoyable. Finally it's the cast that seal the deal for why this is as good as it gets for fantasy escapist cinema. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson & Crispin Glover are the perfect quintet, each feeding off each other and doing justice to the excellently constructed story.Made for $19 million, Back To The Future went on to make a worldwide gross of over $381 million, and those are the kind of figures you really can't argue with. It's snappy, happy and down right funny, so really, if you don't like Back To The Future then seek medical help immediately. 10/10","

"jcbutthead86","23 November 2015","Back To The Future is one greatest films ever made,an excellent and unforgettable classic that combines terrific direction,a wonderful cast,an amazing score and soundtrack,a fantastic script and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future one of the best films of the 1980s that is Popcorn entertainment at it's best.Set in the fictional town of Hill Valley,California,Back To The Future tells the story of teenager Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox). who is asked by his friend eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd)to help him on experiment a time machine made out of a Delorean car. After an unfortunate incident Marty gets into the time machine and is accidentally transported back to 1955 where he not only meets Dr. Brown but also meets his parents George(Crispin Glover)and Lorraine(Lea Thompson)as teenagers. With the help of Dr. Brown Marty must find a way to get back to the year 1985.Released in 1985,Back To The Future is a brilliant and entertaining film that was without a doubt the biggest Box Office hit of 1985 grossing over 300 million dollars world wide and is just an instant classic from the moment you watch it and is one of those movies that is the definition of what a blockbuster should be and where everything from the direction,the cast and story work to absolute perfection with no false note or missing beat. I don't think director Robert Zemeckis or the cast knew what they had was something that was special,magical and timeless and can be enjoyed by people of all ages and will continue to be enjoyed by past,present and future generations. The movie is also the first feature of one of the most beloved movie trilogies of all-time and while all three Back To The Future films are classics as a whole the first is still the best. What Back To The Future does so well is that it takes the time travel movie and gives it style and creativity mixing together different movie genres Comedy,SCI-FI,Action,Romance and thrills giving viewers everything but the kitchen sink but the movie never becomes uneven or confusing making Back To The Future one of the best genre mash-up movies I have ever seen. Although there are some serious moments Back To The Future is lighthearted with non-stop fun From beginning to end,Back To The Future has an energy and flow that just never stops and keeps you glued to the screen with relentless pace and excitement that makes the film re-watchable and iconic to this very day. The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is incredible and quotable with tons memorable scenes and dialog that are funny done with perfection and fun as well with ingenious style and rapid fire delivery that is wonderful. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF are hilarious and fun with moments that are over the top and great thanks to the actions and reactions of Marty and Doc Brown and the main characters. The SCI-FI scenes in BTTF involving the Delorean are so dazzling and are done with imagination and beauty that will make your jaw drop and it doesn't matter how many times you see BTTF you will be blown away by the Delorean sequences. There have been many classic movie duos throughout cinema and among the great duos are Marty and Doc. The scenes between Marty and Doc are truly funny with terrific back and forth banter and have some of the best scenes in the film that are unforgettable. While the two are different in personality and are separated by age the two have a friendship that feels genuine and real where you feel that Marty and Doc would have each other's back at all costs. The friendship between Marty and Doc is further cemented in Part II and III where you feel they will be friends forever whether it's in the future or in the present. Marty and Doc are two amazing and memorable characters that will never be forgotten. The ending of Back To The Future is terrific,thrilling and filled with surprises that will leave viewers laughing and smiling. A fantastic ending.The cast is wonderful. Michael J. Fox is excellent and funny as Marty McFly,with Fox bringing laughs and charisma to the role. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant as Dr. Emmett Doc Brown,with Lloyd being delightfully over the top and having a fantastic chemistry with Fox. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover are wonderful as Lorraine and George McFly,Marty's parents. Thomas F. Wilson is terrific and fun as Biff,a neighborhood bully. James Toklin is great as Mr. Strickland,a hard nosed principal. Claudia Wells(Jennifer),Mark McClure(Dave McFly),Wendie Jo Sperber(Linda McFly),Jeffrey Jay Cohan(Skinhead),Casey Siemaszko(3-D),Billy Zane(Match),George DiCenzo(Sam Baines),Francis Lee McCain(Stella Baines),Harry Waters Jr.(Marvin Berry),Donald Fullilove(Goldie Wilson),Will Hare(Pa Peabody)and Norman Alden(Lou)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is amazing,with Zemeckis always moving the camera while giving the film with great camera angles,pace and atmosphere.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding and one of best scores in movie history,with Silvestri's score being epic,suspenseful and uplifting. Incredible score,Silvestri. There is also a great soundtrack featuring songs by Huey Lewis And The News(The Power Of Love and Back In Time).The Special Effects by Industrial,Light and Magic is dazzling and visual stunning and will blow your mind. Great effects,ILM.In final word,if you love Comedies,SCI-FI,Robert Zemeckis or Films in general,I highly suggest you see Back To The Future,one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent,unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.","

"TheNorthernMonkee","17 October 2005","SPOILERS When you build a time machine, it just has to be a Deloren really. The corrupt car manufacturer's ultimate advert for his death trap vehicle, ""Back to the Future"" was your regular 1980s classic. Well written, entertaining to watch and with a killer soundtrack, it's a film which has managed to survive the test of time. Released midway through one of the most irrelevant decades in history, this Michael J Fox driven piece is great.When Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) creates a time machine, he's made his greatest, and most risky invention. Shot for stealing the plutonium power source, Brown's invention undertakes it's first major expedition with young Marty McFly (Fox) behind the wheel. Travelling back thirty years to the 1950s, Marty finds himself in his home town of Hill Valley and in the company of his lovestruck mother (Lea Thompson) and useless father (Crispin Glover). Destroying their entire relationship, Marty manages to completely screw up his entire future. Still, with no way to get home, and a school bully on the prowl, he's got all the time in the world to fix it.Perhaps the one set of films that Robert Zemeckis will ever be remembered for, ""Back to the Future"" and it's two sequels will forever be remembered as an entertaining piece of cinema. From the opening of the film where Fox glides around the fictional town of Hill Valley to the sound of Huey Lewis' ""Power of Love"", you can tell what decade it is, and yet you continue to watch.It might be harsh to really slate the 1980s as much as we do, after all, we did get entertaining films like ""Ghostbusters"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Out"" and ""The Breakfast Club"", but for every one good film, there were so many dire productions. A bit like the current box office climate, you knew that the majority were a disappointing mess, but there would always turn up one rare beauty. ""Back to the Future"" is one of those.Led by some straight forward but solid performances, the film just has something about it. The witty notion of the hypocritical mother and her secret youth, that one magnificent scene where Michael J Fox performs ""Johnny B Goode"" at the school prom and Marvin Berry (Harry Waters Jnr) phones his cousin Chuck, all add together to leave you with a huge grin on your face. It's an icon for an age, and for once it makes you grateful for the decade.Robert Zemeckis has never really found the highs of the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy (1994's ""Forrest Gump"" is his only other major success) since the final part was released in 1990. Ultimately though, there are worse positions to be in. A rare joy in an otherwise dire decade, this film and the continuing parts, was an entertaining piece of cinema which left you happy and content. It's perfect afternoon viewing, and the one surprise is that it isn't shown more often.","

"maxskyfan-9","28 September 2014","PlotMarty's good friend, Dr. Emmett Brown, invents a time machine in the form of a sports car and because of unforeseen circumstances Marty finds himself trapped in 1955 where he ends up meeting his parents and inadvertently fowls up how his parents come together and fall in love. This blunder endangers Marty's very existence because if his parents don't become an item he will never be born so Marty must move heaven and earth to get his parents on a road to romantic bliss. Meanwhile the younger version of Dr. Emmett Brown must find a way to get his time machine working so he can get Marty back to his own time.Character DevelopmentThe lead character Marty McFly doesn't experience much character development, but he is able to influence others dramatically. Only these developments aren't the focus of the story and mostly happen off screenActingOne of the ingredients that are equal to the magic of the story itself is the acting. The characters come to life on screen and carry over to everyday life. This has become an event film that has worked its way from pop culture to film history that has helped mark a decade. There is nothing second rate when it comes to the acting for there are no false moments in any of the cast's performances. Though there is a lot of action and racing about, much of what makes repeated viewing of this film possible are the humorous situations that Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) keep getting themselves into and how they react to them. All the lead actors do stellar work and make the trouble that Marty and Emmett get into very believable.OverviewThere are a lot surprises that are both humorous and entertaining. Again the writing is on a level all to its own where one scene snaps perfectly with the next. There never seems to be a moment in time that doesn't connect to a later moment. It is quite brilliant and the transformation from the cast's older to younger selves is really amazing. Mix this with the energy of the soundtrack and this has got to be one of best movies of the 80s if not that of all time. Top marks all around.","

"preppy-3","29 July 2005","HUGE 1980s hit movie. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox in his breakthrough role) has a miserable life. His father is a wimp, his mother an alcoholic and they live in a rundown area. His only friend is a crazy scientist (Christopher Lloyd). Lloyd turns a DeLorean into a time machine (don't ask) and Fox accidentally ends up in 1955. He also accidentally fumbles his parents first meeting--so his mom is falling for him! He has to get his parents together...or he won't exist. And how is he going to get back to 1985?Sounds silly but this actually is a lot of fun. The direction is good and the script is fast and very funny--I LOVED Lloyd's reaction to Reagan being president and Fox dealing with 1950s life. Also the 1950s outfits and cars are incredible. SPOILER!!! It does go a little too far at the end with Fox supposedly inspiring Chuck Berry--but that's a small complaint. END SPOILER!!! The acting is good. Fox and Lloyd are both great and play off each other very well--some of Fox's dead pan expressions to Lloyds ravings are quite funny. And Fox is so YOUNG! Lea Thompson was excellent playing Fox's mother--she convincingly ages herself AND looks like a teenager. Crispin Glover overdoes it though as Fox's father--TOO over the top. Also great to see Frances Lee McCain playing Thompson's mother--this woman is a great actress and played mothers through many great 1980s film (like ""Footloose"", ""Gremlins"", ""Stand By Me"" and into the 90s with ""Scream""). Also Billy Zane (in his first role) appears as a bully--but has no dialogue.Only two things spoil this a little. The open ending (it ends with ""to be continued..."") and the constant product placement--I know a lot of movies do it but here it was virtually nonstop! When it starts calling attention to itself that's a problem.Also Huey Lewis and the News (remember them?) had a big hit with the opening song ""The Power of Love"". And don't miss Lewis' cute cameo as a teacher at the beginning. I give this a solid 9.","

"Tweekums","11 July 2009","One would have thought that a film made almost twenty five years ago about somebody travelling back in time thirty years would have dated terribly but it seems just as fresh now as when I first saw in on betamax all those years ago. I'm sure people will be enjoying it for decades to come.Michael J. Fox will almost certainly be best remembered for his role as Marty McFly, the eighties teenager who accidentally travels back to 1955 in a converted DeLorean. While much of the humour is derived from the differences between the two eras that isn't over done and it doesn't get in the way of the main plot. Not only must Marty enlist the help of his friend Dr. Brown to get him back to 1985 he must get his parents to fall in love all over again because he accidentally stopped their first meeting. This problem seems to be greater than time travel as his father is the school wimp who is constantly being harassed by the school bully Biff Tannen and his mother has fallen for him.The supporting cast do a great job too, especially Christopher Lloyd is the archetypal mad scientist Dr Brown and Lea Thompson as Marty's mother who is rather prudish in the eighties but clearly knew how to have a good time when she was a teenager.. much to Marty's surprise. In a time before everything was done with CGI the effects are great and not overused. I'd recommend this film, along with its two sequels to anybody with a sense of humour.","

"classicsoncall","8 February 2013","Here's a movie that was entertaining when it came out in the mid-Eighties and once again when I watched it today. The issue I have is with the IMDb ratings system that ranks this picture in the number #48 spot as I write this, with ""Citizen Kane"" at #45 and ""Vertigo"" at #51. For me, this doesn't compute. No one can justify to me how this comedy, sci-fi flick gets honored as one of the Top Fifty movies of all time.Well hopefully, my minor little rant doesn't spoil things for you. I do like the film for it's players and the clever way Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) manages to navigate his way through the Fifties. I became a Christopher Lloyd fan right from the get-go when he made his debut in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", and his Reverend Jim character in the 'Taxi' TV series was one of the most original ever. He's got the perfect look and attitude for a crazed scientist and it would have been cool to see him work with classic icons of the horror genre like Karloff, Lugosi and Chaney. That would have been something.The thing that bugs me about the characters a bit are the way George McFly (Crispin Glover) and Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) are portrayed. They're really more like caricatures, though Biff as the town bully had a certain amount of credibility even if he was annoying. I had forgotten how attractive Lea Thompson was as Lorraine Baines, Marty's future Mom but sporting a major crush on him that conjured up all kinds of potential icky situations, but they were handled tastefully for the most part. The biggest kick for me was when Marvin Berry (Harry Waters Jr.) called his cousin Chuck to check out the new music sensation.So yeah, this is a fun movie and a generally family friendly one that would have been better served if some of the language had been toned down a bit. Some of the time travel stuff goes over the top, like the scene where Marty returns from 1955 and sees himself in the present about to do the time jump. Stuff like that just makes me think about the concept too much. As for the very ending scene, that has got to be about the most blatant set up to scream 'sequel' that I've ever seen.","

"tavm","21 October 2015","Today was the day me and my best friend from high school-who now works at the movie theatre that is showing these Back to the Future trilogies-saw these again, a little more than 30 years after this first one initially came out. Because the second one took place partially on October 21, 2015 was the reason for this series playing for that one day. Anyway, this first one was the best of them mainly because of the contrast between teen Marty McFly's '80s lifestyle and that of his parents' when they were teens in the '50s. Also, his relationship with Doc Brown was also a big part of the movie's phenomenal success. That and plenty of jokes about culture shock and great chase scenes. My favorite scene involved Marty playing heavy metal licks at the '50s dance sequence. And what great players like Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd handling their roles the way they do! And, yes, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson are also fine as Marty's parents and his father's bully, respectively. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale fashioned a fine screenplay with excellent direction from Zemeckis. This is still my favorite '80s movie, bar none! So on that note, I definitely highly recommend Back to the Future. P.S. One of the most interesting things I now know about this movie is that the younger brother of Lorraine in the '50s sequence was played by Jason Hervey who was also in the other summer blockbuster of the summer of '85-Pee Wee's Big Adventure-and would later play Kevin Arnold's older brother, Wayne, on ""The Wonder Years"".","

"AlsExGal","5 August 2016","Why will this film be remembered? Well, I'd say the strength and chemistry of the characters alone makes it an eight. This film was perfectly cast even down to the supporting characters. Then there is that marvelous score that reflects the atmosphere and energy of the entire film and is immediately recognizable. And although the overall ground of time travel has been trodden before, this one addresses time travel and its implications on so many levels. There is the main story arc, but then there are lots of little ripples going out to the universe as a result of the present interacting with the past that you may have to watch it several times to catch all of the changes and all of the jokes.Besides time travel, this one merges in questions about self-esteem and how it is built or destroyed, and how it changes things to EARN the girl instead of having her handed to you through a trick of fate and actually your own moral failings, along with some great action scenes and edge of your chair suspense. Also, it demonstrates what you've always suspected - that your parents were probably quite different as teenagers than they have told you. Heck, they probably even THINK they are telling you the truth! Still there is some stuff that just bugs me - just enough to knock one star off of the film from a perfect ten. Someone smart enough to build a time machine (Christopher Lloyd as the loopy Dr. Brown) does not know that Christ was not born on 12/25/0000? People being erased from existence in order of birth as a result of messing up the past? And why would George hang around in a town working at a job where Biff, the town bully, continues to dog him for thirty years past high school? Why not leave town, or at least spike Biff's drink with some untraceable poison at the company Christmas party that produces a death that looks like a heart attack while George laughs maniacally (in private of course)? But now we are talking a different genre of film aren't we? Plus, why are Marty's brother and sister exactly how you would expect them to turn out given Dad's lack of self esteem and mom's unhappiness with her situation, but Marty has turned out to be this normal kid, an apple falling far from the tree? And I really think that Chuck Berry wrote every song he wrote without any help from a time traveler. The only answer to all of these questions but the Christmas one is that these things have to happen or else the story cannot play out as cleverly as it does. I'll let you watch and see how it plays out.But first I have to set up the story for you. Michael J. Fox plays Marty, a normal kid who hails from a dysfunctional family of underachievers, and whose parents sole reason for being married seems to be that mom's father ran over dad with his car. Marty befriends Doc Brown, a guy who over the years has sold the entire family fortune he inherited in building his time machine. He finally accomplishes this, but to do so he needs plutonium, which he steals from some Libyans. Unfortunately the Libyans show up at the Twin Pines Mall where doc and Marty are about to give the time machine a test drive - it is in automobile form, a DeLorean to be specific. To get away from the terrorists, Marty has to use the time machine as a getaway car. In the process he crosses the speed threshold that sends the time machine into the date it was last programmed for, which happens to be the date his parents met back in 1955. Marty's only hope is to go find his friend Doc Brown, as a young man, in hopes Doc can help him, even as Doc lies dead in 1985, shot by the Libyans. Well, it gets complicated, but you'll enjoy every minute of this film that manages to be so 80's even when it is in the 50s.","

"ComedyFan2010","25 March 2014","The movie takes us on a great time travel where a teenager McFly meets his parents when they were teenagers. He both needs to get back to 1985 but before that to get his parents to fall in love with each other so he doesn't get erased from the existence.The movie is absolutely great. It has so much energy and there is always something happening. It is also great to look into the past. Nowadays 1985 is old times as well so the movie has twice the charm when we get to see both the 80's and the 50's. And the writers did a great job to make jokes to show us the differences between those times. Even as somebody who hasn't lived in the 50's I could get them, and the jokes about let's say Marty's 80's vest are even more hilarious to us now. So the movie aged very well, if it didn't even get better.The casting is also perfect. Michael J. Fox is the right actor for Marty. He was not the one cast at first but I am so glad they got him. Even though Eric Stoltz is a great actor, but the footage with him from Back to the Future had a more serious feeling to it, it kind of was losing the charm I love so much. Maybe then there would be no other sequels.Christopher Lloyd created a great persona as Doc. If I see a picture of him I would always recognize him. He always has this great crazy scientist in him. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover who played Marty's parents made a wonderful performance by being them at different ages. The make up artists also contributed to the success of it.I loved this movie as a kid, I love it now. It has everything that I like for such a genre: great cast, a fun story, great lines, well connected plot and perfect time setting. One of the movies I can watch again and again.","

"Mr-Fusion","4 July 2015","Now here's a film that manages to engender nostalgia for two different decades, while still remaining timeless. You don't see that every day. Strip away the ILM effects, space-time wrinkles and polished veneer and ""Back to the Future"" is really just about a kid witnessing his loser middle-aged parents during their high school years. It's such a novel idea and the movie that builds on that is just so precisely tuned. This was never a big effects movie and never promised huge Summer spectacle, but it does offer the honest thrill of going on an adventure. And that's tough to beat. It's got everything: action, science fiction, comedy, a teen movie subplot and (most importantly) an endearing relationship between two memorable characters (and let me say this right now: Christopher Lloyd steals every one of his scenes).For me, this is the total package of pure entertainment. It's lodged itself into the cultural lexicon and for very good reason. ""Back to the Future"" has been my favorite for years, and I just don't see that changing anytime soon. This is my idea of a perfect movie.10/10","

It's a straightforward and comedic crowd-pleaser with relatable characters and plotlines. As an escapist adventure, it is very thrilling and we get really absorbed in the protagonist's quest.","

"Quinoa1984","8 July 2000","This is a memorable sci-fi comedy that will always be remembered for it's amazing visual effects and dolorian time machine.  Plot (if actually memorable) is about a regular teen (Michael J. Fox in one of his best performances) who is friends with a brilliant yet crazed doc (Christopher Lloyd is terrific as this Doc) who creates a time machine using a flux capasitor and 1.21 gigawots (what the hell is a giawot!).  But suddenly, McFly finds himself in 1955, 30 years earlier to his present date.  And not only does he have to get back to the future, he also has to reunite his parents after a incident.  Great fun with this cast and tale, with some great direction by Robert Zemeckis and from Steven Spielberg's Amblin entertainment.  The best one of the trilogy (though the other 2 are questionable).

"rajatdahiyax","22 October 2014","Contemporary high schooler Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) doesn't have the most pleasant of lives. Browbeaten by his principal at school, Marty must also endure the acrimonious relationship between his nerdy father (Crispin Glover) and his lovely mother (Lea Thompson), who in turn suffer the bullying of middle-aged jerk Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), Marty's dad's supervisor. The one balm in Marty's life is his friendship with eccentric scientist Doc (Christopher Lloyd), who at present is working on a time machine. Accidentally zapped back into the 1950s, Marty inadvertently interferes with the budding romance of his now-teen aged parents. Our hero must now reunite his parents-to-be, lest he cease to exist in the 1980s. It won't be easy, especially with the loutish Biff, now also a teenager, complicating matters. Beyond its dazzling special effects, the best element of Back to the Future is the performance of Michael J. Fox, who finds himself in the quagmire of surviving the white-bread 1950s with a hip 1980s mindset.","

"nickenchuggets","13 August 2021","If you were born after 1980, chances are you have seen this movie at least once, and you probably love it. Even for audiences watching long after its hype has faded away, Back to the Future still manages to be an unforgettable (and funny) experience because of how original it is. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the movie follows a teenager named Marty (Michael J Fox) who is accidentally sent back in time to the mid 1950s, thus setting in motion a possible paradox which involves his parents never meeting each other. Of course this means Marty will no longer exist upon returning to the 1980s, so it's up to him to get his future parents into a relationship. I think it's safe to say this type of plot has been attempted only a handful of times before in motion picture history, and is one of the reasons why this movie is remembered so positively. Before his whole quest begins, Marty McFly is busy living out the average and mundane life of an 80s teenager in california. His father doesn't know how to stand up for himself, and is frequently bossed around by his colleague Biff. Marty's mother drinks incessantly, and Marty dreams of escaping this hopeless existence. Soon, Marty comes across a mad scientist named ""Doc"" Brown (Christoper Lloyd), and he showcases a time machine consisting of a DeLorean DMC car augmented with flux capacitors and plutonium. Brown opts to show Marty a demonstration of how the car works and punches in a date of 1955. Shortly after, Libyan terrorists sent by colonel Gaddafi show up unexpectedly and shoot Doc for stealing plutonium from them to power the car. Marty has no choice but to escape in the DeLorean, accidentally activating its time travel capability. Upon being sent back to 1955, Marty realizes he doesn't have enough fuel to get back to the 1980s. He decides to search around on foot and comes across an adolescent version of his father, only to find Biff has been bullying him since his school days. Marty's sole objective now is to somehow get his future parents, George and Lorraine, into a relationship so Marty will still exist 30 years from now. After sustaining a direct hit from a car at low speed, Marty is knocked out and Lorraine has to care for him. Later on, Marty comes across a younger version of Doc Brown and must let him know his life-threatening predicament. Although Brown says the only way to have enough electricity for time travel is getting struck by lightning, Marty luckily possesses a newspaper from the future that states a lightning storm is due to hit the area around the town's courthouse that night. Meanwhile, Lorraine's attraction to her future son continues to get stronger, which will cause a time paradox if George doesn't intervene soon. Marty somehow has to get George and Lorraine to go to the upcoming school dance together in a hurry, but Biff shows up and forces himself on her. George finally decides to make a change and punches him out, allowing him and his future wife to go to the dance unimpeded. After a particularly wild guitar performance by Marty playing Johnny B Goode (which wasn't even out at the time), he shows up at the courthouse when the storm is about to hit. The lightning strikes right as the DeLorean (with Marty inside) hits 88 mph, sending him back to 1985, but the car stops working right after. Marty returns back to the parking lot where Doc Brown first showed him the car, and shows up right as the Libyan terrorists are gunning him down. All seems lost, and it appears Marty's actions in the 50s have broken the consistency of space and time, but Doc reveals he's wearing a bulletproof vest. The next day, Marty finds out everything is right with the world. His father is an accomplished writer, his mother doesn't drink anymore, and Biff is now George's servant. At the end, Doc shows up in the DeLorean and tells Marty to come with him to the year 2015. Back to the Future is undoubtedly one of the 80's most remarkable films, and once you have seen it, it's clear why it has left such an impression on the millions who have done so already. There are many reasons why this movie is impressive even almost 40 years later, but I think the majority of it stems from how it tries to connect the older culture of the US with the new. When Marty is talking to his past relatives about sightseeing on JFK Avenue, one replies ""Who the hell is John F Kennedy?"" Another ironic moment comes when Marty encounters the young version of Doc Brown, and Doc doesn't believe he is really from the future. He asks him to prove his claims by telling him who the american president is as of 1985, and Marty answers Ronald Reagan. Doc Brown still doesn't believe it, saying how a hollywood actor would never be elected. Those are just two instances. There's tons of things like that in this movie. It also sometimes works to the detriment of the experience, such as when Marty is playing Chuck Berry at the school dance and kicks over an amplifier. The amp makes a reverb noise, which amps weren't capable of producing until the early 1960s. There's another part where you can clearly see disability signs on the roads, when these weren't around until the 1970s. Of course, the film makers couldn't get absolutely everything perfect, and that's understandable. These things are still there if you pay attention though. It's also interesting to remind people how back in the 80s, there was concern that this movie wouldn't even be popular since it wasn't indecent enough. This is a strange criticism considering how the film contains allusions to racism, rape, and most prominently, Marty's mother being incestuously attracted to him before he's even born. All this aside, Back to the Future has stood the test of time (pun intended) as not just one of the 80's best movies, but one of the best movies, period. Zemeckis has said he will not allow anyone to remake any of the 3 movies, and this was a very reassuring thing to hear.","

"philip_vanderveken","2 August 2005","Even though I'm still convinced that the eighties are one of the worst decades in recent history when it comes to movies and music and even though I never liked Sci-Fi movies, there is one big exception to that rule. In my opinion ""Back to the Future"" is not only one of the best movies in the genre, it's also in my list of all time favorite movies. When I saw it for the first time, I remember to be blown away by it. But than again, I was only 10 years old, not exactly an age on which you've already seen many really good movies to which you can compare another one. But even now, 20 years after its first release and after I've seen hundreds of movies, I still like it a lot.It's 1985 and Marty McFly is a typical teenager who doesn't like his parents and who has some problems at school. His best friend is Doc Brown, a weird inventor of all kinds of (useless) machines. But this time he has invented something that is much more interesting. He has created a plutonium-powered time machine based on a DeLorean. But when something goes wrong, Marty is accidentally sent back to 1955, the time in which his parents still were young. Not only has he got to adapt to this entirely new environment, he also has to make sure that nothing is changed, because that might have serious consequences for the future...I guess the best reason why this movie works so well and feels so timeless is because they don't use the time machine to go forward. Instead of showing us the future, which wouldn't look exactly like it is right now, they have chosen to go back 30 years, a time period which they new very well and could recreate perfectly. If they hadn't done this, the movie would have felt dated one day and no-one would have liked it because it was far from possible. Another good thing about this movie is the acting. Take for instance Michael J. Fox. Not everything that he has done in his career was very successful, but in this movie he shines. I truly believe that this is one of his best performances ever. The same for Christopher Lloyd. Even though his Dr. Emmett Brown looks like if he could have come out of a cartoon, his acting gives the character something likable and makes you forget about that 'problem'.Overall I really liked this movie a lot. It's one of the finest examples in Sci-Fi movies and I can keep watching it time after time. That's why I believe that this movie doesn't deserve a rating lower than 8/10.","

"sme_no_densetsu","12 February 2015","Fresh off the success of ""Romancing the Stone"", Robert Zemeckis parlayed his newfound clout into the highest grossing movie of 1985 - ""Back to the Future"". A combination of science fiction and nostalgia, the movie touched a chord with contemporary audiences and continues to resonate with viewers thirty years later.The movie's protagonist is Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a teenager who is accidentally sent back in time thirty years. After he unwittingly prevents his parents' first meeting he must make things right or else he'll nullify his own existence.Although the premise is science fictional, the treatment is more or less fantastical, with only a superficial attempt to explain the technology behind time travel. Regardless, the souped-up DeLorean and its flux capacitor make for an iconic time machine.Meanwhile, the Oscar-nominated original screenplay offers something for everyone. In addition to the overall element of science fantasy spectacle there's action, adventure, romance, comedy & even surprising dramatic depth at times.However, the story may not have come to life so vividly without the movie's well-assembled cast. Replacing Eric Stoltz after shooting had already begun, original choice Michael J. Fox was thankfully able to accept the lead role at that juncture. Today, it is difficult, if not impossible, to envision anyone better suited to the role of Marty McFly. In support, Christopher Lloyd is likewise irreplaceable as Doc Brown. The icing on the cake is Marty's parents, enthusiastically played by the lovely Lea Thompson and the always interesting Crispin Glover.Zemeckis's direction also leaves little to be desired. The movie has an attractive look throughout and even the thirty year old special effects have held up pretty well. Musically, the movie benefits greatly from Alan Silvestri's rousing orchestral score. The pair of soundtrack contributions from Huey Lewis and the News are also memorable.Overall, ""Back to the Future"" offers high concept thrills backed up by considerable film-making prowess. Iconic in many respects, the movie is among the best, and the most entertaining, of the 1980's.","

"Ben_Cheshire","21 May 2004","Part I is certainly the cleverest of the three. A rip-snorter of a premise: Marty (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back to 1955 in the time machine that his friend Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd, in a zany, unforgettable, over-the-top performance that creates one of the best characters of all time) has built, and he accidentally interferes in the meeting of his parents, so that instead of his grandpa hitting his father (Crispin Glover in another over-the-top but crucial and memorable performance) with his car, he hits Marty instead. So instead of Marty's mother falling in love with his father, she falls in love with him! Controversial and awkward though it may be, you can't deny its greatness. The real aim of this, though, is not incest, its learning what his mother was really like in her youth, compared to how she tells it. Plus, it lends a certain urgency to what Marty must do to set back the course of time, which makes us need to watch till the end to see he does it: he must somehow make his parents meet and fall in love, or he won't be born!The second main quest in the movie is the technical problem of getting Marty back to the future: since in Part I the time machine runs on plutonium, and plutonium doesn't exist in 1955, they have to find some other way of generating the 1.21 gigawatts needed to get the car to 88 miles per hour and send it into time.The third main problem of the movie is that on the day when Marty got sent back in time, in 1985, Doc will be shot by Libyan terrorists for stealing their plutonium to run the time machine, unless Marty does something about it. A terrific feature of these movies are their climaxes: Part I is a terrific scene where Marty must hit the power line connected to the clock tower at 88 miles per hour at the precise moment lightening strikes it, involving a reference to a famous silent movie image, of Harold Lloyd hanging from a clock high on a building in Safety Last (1921).Back to the Future pulls a lot of old punches, uses a lot of traditional storytelling gags and devices that feel quite familiar, but its unabashed sense of fun, larger-than-life tone and ripsnorter premise make it the kind of movie you treasure and watch time and time again.","

"ofpsmith","4 October 2014","This movie is filled with ideas, jokes, and great characters. And it works on every level. Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager living in the year 1985. He has a less than perfect life, as his parents George McFly (Crispin Glover) a nerd, and Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson) a drunk don't connect. His two friends that we see are his girlfriend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Cristopher Lloyd) a crazy scientist. When one day when Doc. Brown invents a DeLoeran time machine Marty inadvertently goes back to the year 1955 where he sees George and Lorraine as high school students. He also sees George's future supervisor Biff Tannen (Thomas F Wilson) and the current school bully. Marty has to meet up with 1955 Doc. Brown so that he can fix the DeLorean, hook it up to a lighting bolt to get the required electricity to go back to 1985 and prevent Doc. Brown from being killed by Libyan terrorists. As if that weren't enough things get worse when Lorraine becomes infatuated with Marty instead of George. Therefore this could prevent his own existence. So he has to get his parents to go to the dance together, fall in love, so he will even be a person. This movie like Ghostbusters will confuse the mess out of you if you think about too long. Just try to enjoy it. And this is entirely possible. This film is filled to the brim with funny lines, catchphrases, great acting, great characters, great jokes, and everything about it is great.

"Coventry","29 June 2008","Few things are as difficult to accomplish as a movie dealing with time-traveling. To take on themes as risky as paradoxes and time loops you primarily need a healthy dose of courage and ambition, but most importantly loads of writing talent and cinematic vision. The scenario of ""Back to the Future"", courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and co-producer Bob Gale, is honestly one of the most brilliant ones ever penned down and, thanks to the financial support of several acclaimed producers (including Steven Spielberg and Frank Marshall), it also became one of the most massively entertaining films of all time, with sublime special & sound effects, diversity of genres and some of the greatest casting choices and acting performances ever. ""Back to the Future"" is quintessentially speaking a Sci-Fi comedy, but Robert Zemeckis admirably also hints at the more emotional and melodramatic aspects regarding time traveling. Also, even though the film boosts some of the greatest effects ever, their use merely remains functional and occasionally, so that the emphasis continuously lies on the story and the development of the characters instead of on flamboyant machinery and overlong speeches about scientific theories. The DeLorean is a stylish and original piece of scenery, but other than the fantastic and already legendary vehicle there are no giant laboratories with thousands of flickering lights. Marty McFly is a typical mid-80's teenager with a skateboard he knows how to use and a delightful high school sweetheart that loves him very much. His parents George and Lorraine, however, are a pitiable and hopelessly old-fashioned couple and thus he spends most of his free time with his genius but slightly eccentric friend Doc Brown. The latter invented a time-traveling device and, following a series of bizarre events, Marty accidentally travels back to 1955; the year his parents met and fell in love during the school prom. Marty has only one chance to return to the future, but in the meantime he has to correct the events he tampered with in order to save the future and even assure his own birth. The script is very well constructed and literally stuffed with witty little details that refer to earlier events and/or events that have yet to appear, either later in the film or even in one of the sequels. The humor works, the light-headed tone and atmosphere puts a big smile on your face, you come to care for the characters and the awesome soundtrack even makes it difficult to remain in your seat. Michael J. Fox, Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson all give away excellent performances, but my two preferred roles are for Christopher Lloyd (with his confused looks and bizarre facial expressions, he makes a superb mad scientist) and Crispin Glover. The latter appears to be born to depict weirdos and uncanny freaks, so the role of introvert and mysterious George McFly fits him perfectly.","

The idea of time travel will get you thinking and wishing you could go back in time. It seems like a lot of fun but the paradoxes that time travel could create might be a bit bizarre just as Doc (Lloyd) and Marty (Fox) found out.This sci-fi is a wonderful classic and is still great by today's film standards.10/10","

"mmallon4","21 October 2015","An aura of 'cool' permeates everything about Back to the Future. I could imagine seeing this film when it came out in 1985 (of course I wasn't alive) and watching Marty McFly riding through Hill Valley on his skateboard while holding onto the back of a truck to The Power of Love by Huey Lewis and the News and thinking to myself, ""omg, this is just the coolest film ever"". To me Marty McFly is the personification of cool, he rides skateboards, has a hot girlfriend, plays guitar. Yet his life is far from perfect; his dad is a dweb, his mum is an alcoholic and his uncle is in prison. This brings him down to a relatable level, plus he hangs out with a crazy old scientist. Why? I don't want to know. I like the mystery of not knowing how this unconventional friendship came to be. The technical jargon between Marty and Doc is a never-ending pleasure to listen and even lines which shouldn't be memorable are somehow highly quotable (""Wait a minute Doc, are you telling me that it's 8:25...dam I'm late for school!""). Likewise taking the coolest looking, commercially available car and making that the time machine is yet another stroke of genius. Notice the scene in which we see the DeLorean for the first time; it's impossible for Doc Brown to get inside the DeLorean while it is inside the truck so he would have had to get into the car and drive it into the truck and just wait there until Marty would show up and then drive it out and exit the car. I guess Doc thought he had made a time machine that looked so badass he really had to give it an impressive introduction to Marty. The whole movie has the best uses of product placements I've seen in a film; never before have I been happier to see advertisements for Pepsi and Texaco. The pacing of Back to the Future is perfect, the film never lets up; the odds keep stacking up against Marty and the suspense towards the end of the film is crazy.Even though most of the film takes place in the 1950's, Back To The Future is the film which defines the 1980's. The ending in which Marty finds his family has been changed for the better and he gets the 4x4 vehicle he wanted; it's a wish fulfilment fantasy and very much a capitalist, 80's ideal. It's an uplifting ending, providing you ignore the fact that Marty now has to adjust to living with a family he has no previous memory off. It makes sense that Marty goes back to the year 1955, the time period of when adolescence had a voice and began an economic force for the first time in history; plus just take a look at the title of what won Best Picture that year. Marty's mother being attracted to her son is weirdly funny plus his mother being the opposite of her adult herself; makes you question your own parents claims about their day. I'm always struck by the moment when Marty tell his relatives in 1955 he has two TVs and they think he's joking yet if you told someone in 1985 that households today own upwards of 6-7 TVs, they would have the same reaction.Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Back To The Future; to me these are the trilogy of trilogies. The three film sagas I can watch again and again, always notice something new on each viewing, discussing every character to no end, coming up with crazy fan theories and trying to find an explanation to any possible plot hole. I'm sure there are still plenty of subtle gags, use of foreshadowing and who knows what lurked within this film which I still haven't noticed. Is it possible for a film to be 100% perfect, one which has absolutely nothing wrong with it no matter how minuscule? I can't think of another film (or series) which has a better use of repeating images and motifs. If I could only bring one DVD to a desert island, it would be my trilogy box set so I could spend my time uncovering every last secret in the trilogy. I love how self-contained the movies are; there are so closely connected to each other and the perfect film trilogy to watch in one go (as I have done several times).But what is it that makes Back to the Future immensely beloved by such a wide audience? I can tell you why I love it but I have a weird and eccentric film taste. Perhaps it's due to time travel is something we all fantasize about, as well as the idea of seeing your parents when they were young. The themes the film explores such as family, coming of age, the generation gap and the optimistic message of free will, that our future isn't written; it's whatever you make it.To Be Continued...","

"OllieSuave-007","4 September 2015","One of the most iconic movies in cinematic history, where, in 1985, young Marty McFly (Michael J.

In meets his high-school-age parents and inadvertently disrupts their first meeting; therefore, he must unite them in order to save their eventual courtship and marriage, and ultimately, Marty's own existence.Despite being an '80s film, the special effects team really did an awesome job in making the time travel elements seem spectacular but realistic-looking, especially the DeLorean.The direction by Robert Zemeckis was well-paced from start to finish, making the film engaging throughout, from Marty traveling back in time to save Emmett Brown to him meeting his future family. Seeing the transformation from the characters in present time to the past with Marty trying to patch things up in the past for a better future outcome are things that make time travel films brilliant. I also especially liked the dialog from the 1955 time-line, ""He's teasing you, nobody has two television sets!"" Spot-on acting by Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson. They all made the film fun and entertaining. As a time travel film, this plot really has a race against time element that makes this movie that much more exciting and an edge-of-your-seat experience. A must-see for sci-fi fans! Grade A","

Every time You look at Zemecis's script, it's like a perfect answer to Field's play-beginning and end, how to grasp the contradictions, how to cover the details, how to control the rhythm, and how the dog is a gorgeous, flowing double setting at the climax that still looks exciting after 30 years.Although the concept of time travel is not carefully dealt with, back to the Future is a comedy about youth, imagination and growing up, while science fiction is a gorgeous coat with many echoes in it. The story about time travel has a wonderful sense of balance.","

"lesleyharris30","7 January 2013","Back to the Future is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. I never grow tired of this film, I know the story inside and out now and I still happily watch it every time, laughing at the same parts, watching at the edge of my seat with others, it never gets old for me, it's a pure eighties classic, and one of the few movies that all generations tend to enjoy. The cast is fantastic and one of the most vital parts of making this movie work, they didn't seem like easy characters, particularly Marty and Doc, they have a lot of layers and certain requirements for portraying them accurately, but every actor nails their role, the script has some very funny bits, but also dramatic parts, and the cast succeeds in all areas of acting. The story is quite complicated, it has the concept of time travel involved, thrown in with a complicated love story, as well as a lot of necessary character development, but it manages to perfectly bring all of this together in a movie that isn't even two hours long, and it dosen't manage to feel any bit cluttered or overlong. Memorable lines, historical movie moments, outstanding performances, a beautiful script and stellar directing from the great Robert Zemeckis, I consider Back to the Future to be my favourite movie, I think all moviegoers should see it, it's a must watch. After ending up in the year 1955 through his friend Doctor Emmet Brown's time machine, Marty McFly must make sure his parents get together to ensure his existence after ruining the moment they fell in love. Best Performance: Christopher Llyod Worst Performance: Wendie Jo Sperber","

"bob the moo","4 August 2006","In 1985 teenager Marty McFly is a bit of an outcast and spends his evenings hanging out with eccentric professor Doc Brown and his various crazy and failed inventions. However when Doc asks Marty to meet him late one night in a mall parking lot, he learns that Doc has invented a working time travel system and inserted it into a DeLorean. Much to Doc's joy and Marty's surprise the machine works on its test run and Doc is all set to be the first man to travel in time when he is killed by the terrorist group who stole plutonium for him with the impression he was making them a bomb. Marty flees in the DeLorean but accidentally winds up back in 1955. Back there he convinces Doc to help him out and come up with a way of getting him back to the future. However the problem of no plutonium appears small when Marty changes the past and stops his parents meeting and falling in love.In its own way this is a classic film that delivers the goods in the same way as Frank Capra's films does although I can understand why for some it doesn't hold quite the same appeal. The plot seems complex as it involves time travel and such but it is deceptively simple and is a clever mix of sci-fi and romantic comedy that is as light and enjoyable as you could hope for. It never makes fun of itself but it never takes itself too seriously and by doing this it pitches it just perfectly. The narrative may be light but it is consistently engaging whether it is the time travel aspect or the relationships. It isn't perfect and it isn't the deepest of films but it is effortlessly a lot of fun and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.The cast are roundly great and are a big part of the film being as light and fun as it is. For my money this is Fox's best all-round performance and he plays the clean-cut American teenager really well bringing energy to the character. Of course Lloyd's performance dominates the film by its sheer colour and energy, making him the most memorable character of the piece. Thompson and Glover (two people who still look young twenty years later damn them) are both good in their roles and work well together and individually to make their part of the narrative match up to the (superficially) more appealing sci-fi stuff. Zemeckis directs with an eye for a memorable shot and visually his film matches the style and vitality of the narrative.Overall a very good film that is every bit as pleasing as the Frank Capra feel-good films that are held up as classics. Whether this film is a classic is as much up for debate as those films' classic status but it isn't really a debate that means a lot to me. What matters is that the film is engaging and entertaining, which it consistently is. It glides through a slick plot and I always enjoy it when I revisit it. Well worth taking a look if you are after a great piece of family fun.","

"anaconda-40658","21 July 2015","Back to the Future (1985): Dir: Robert Zemeckis / Cast: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson: Inventive science fiction comedy about regret and change. It involves a time machine car that can propel into the future once it hits a certain speed. This is all explained through the crazed rants of Doc Brown before he is gunned down. Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, a regular high school senior who dreams of success as a musician. At home he frowns on the fact that his father, George is constantly bullied by his high school rival Biff. Central plot regards Marty transporting back to 1955 to locate Doc and then reintroduce his future parents in a method that allows his father to sustain some dignity. The problem is that his future mother falls for him. Creative and charming with grand humour to boot. Director Robert Zemeckis gives it a nice appeal in the same vein as the famous Frank Capra classics. Fox brings a great innocence and desperation in his securing his parents as well as his own future. Christopher Lloyd as Doc, frizzy gray hair and all steals the film in his attempts to conquer time travel. Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson play the McFly folks in need of heavy reparation. Thomas F. Wilson provides much humour as the ruthless yet brainless school bully. It brings light to the fact that our parents were indeed teenagers once. Score: 9 / 10","

"taylorkingston","27 September 2014","I absolutely love this movie. It's one of my all time favorite movies. It' definitely in my top twenty. In this movie, we see Marty McFly and Doc, great friends, despite the age difference. Doc is a scientist, and Doc is just his nickname, given to him by Marty. His real name is Dr. Emmett Brown. And he has just made a successful time traveling machine. A DeLorean to be specific. That's right, he made a time machine out of a cool looking and futuristic car. But when Marty is accidentally sent back thirty years into the past, to 1955, lots of bad stuff happens. He meets his mother, who accidentally starts falling for her own son, without realizing it. And since he has altered the space/time continuum, he must get his parents to fall in love, otherwise, he's going to fade away. With the help of past Doc, he successfully gets his parents back together and gets home. And when he gets back to 1985, we find out that his life has been altered, for the better. I can't say enough how much I love this movie. It has such great cast including Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox, with a great plot and lots of little future jokes.Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10.","

"tedg","25 March 2010","This year, John Hughes died, and we were reminded of the depth of his insight into subadult suspension. Being reminded of his work impressed me. What will we think when Zemeckis dies?Certainly we will be reminded of how he balanced fantasy and reality in all of his projects. Possibly it will be noted that he softened the Spielberg approach by unintuitively adding incoherence.I think I will remember two films: this one and ""Roger Rabbit."" These both are deceptively trivial. Was this the first mainstream movie that played as cleverly with time travel conundrums? It was not intended to spawn a sequel, and you can see that certain conventions were established that hurt the successors. But seen by itself, the idea of superimposing actors, characters and times in the same package works well. Makes this a gem.Notable is once again the scientist. You have only two types: pipe smoking, chin stroking blackboard thinker who explains, or what we have here. Lloyd is wildhaired, wild-eyed. A hardware guy, not an idea guy. An active risktaker, frantic in demeanor, but with apparently no sense of scope. For instance, he spends more time on a model of how to explain catching lightning than on the apparatus itself.The film revolves around his instabilities and mirrors those as instabilities in the world. It all starts when he bumps his head getting off the toilet, folded into his minute of death from jilted terrorists. Everything that follows is his wacky vision, joined by Marty when knocked out by the nuclear guitar amp.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

"paul_haakonsen","27 March 2019","The 1985 movie ""Back to the Future"" is definitely a timeless - pardon the pun - classic. It truly is a movie that has withstood with the trials of time and proves to be a movie that you can watch again and again and it actually never loses its appeal or charm.Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale managed to put together a very original story here, one that captivates the audience from the very beginning and keeps a grip on the audience until the very end. The story told in ""Back to the Future"" is a story that has so many aspects and so many topics that there definitely is something that appeal to everyone in the audience; ranging from romance, action to science fiction.There is a great pacing to the movie, and director Robert Zemeckis ensured that the movie never left momentum or dropped down in its pacing. This definitely made the movie all the more enjoyable and certainly ensured that the movie can be watched again and again.The movie is packed with great actors and actresses. Of course the movie is so phenomenally well carried by Michael J. Fox in the lead role as Marty McFly, and he definitely made that character lovable and memorable. But right up alongside Fox was Christopher Lloyd in the memorable role as the eccentric Dr. Emmett Brown. Who can't claim to be familiar with the expression ""Great Scott!""? Furthermore, the movie also brought along Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson, whom individually also brought a lot of contents to the movie with their appearances and performances.I can't count the number of times that I have watched this movie, nor the other two in the franchise for that matter. But the original 1985 ""Back to the Future"" is a classic in every meaning of the word.While the movie is from 1985, then the special effects still holds solid even in 2019. Sure they wear symptoms of aging, certainly, but still the special effects are quite good. And back in 1985, they were off the charts.If you, for some unknown reason, never have gotten acquainted with ""Back to the Future"", then shame on you. This is a movie that you HAVE to watch. ""Back to the Future"" is one of those movies that you need to watch regardless of your age, creed and standing.","

"Hey_Sweden","28 January 2021","Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a typical teenager of the 80s, albeit a kid with a friendship with a kooky scientist / inventor named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). One Saturday, very early in the morning, Doc unveils his latest invention: a time machine (fashioned out of a DeLorean) that actually works! When Marty is forced to get inside and take it for a spin, he is transported back to 1955. While temporarily trapped in the past, he manages to interfere in what would have been the fateful union of his parents (Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover). So now his problems are twofold: getting back to his own time AND making sure that his parents get together. Otherwise, HE won't exist!""Back to the Future"" is one of the great, iconic 80s films, a blissfully wacky time-travel comedy that gets a lot of mileage out of plunging the affable Marty into a different time period. Here, he has to learn how to blend in so he doesn't stick out so much. The ingenious script is courtesy of director Robert Zemeckis and his writing partner, Bob Gale, which comes up with plenty of great scenes and some hilarious lines. ""Why are things so ""heavy"" in the future? Is there a problem with the Earths' gravitational pull?"" The period recreation, done on the Universal backlot, is tons of fun, the music score by Alan Silvestri is tremendously good and memorable, and fairly decent makeup transforms a few of the actors into alternate ""past"" and ""present"" versions of their characters. Although running a little long at just under two hours, ""Back to the Future"" wastes little time, managing to hold your attention while it gets up to its top speed.The cast couldn't be better. Fox is extremely engaging as our flustered hero, and Lloyd is just a delight as the guy who gets the ball rolling in terms of plot. Thompson and Glover are endearing, even if the latter can't help but inject some of his standard eccentricities into his role. Thomas F. Wilson is a riot as swaggering bully Biff. ""Why don't you make like a tree...and get out of here."" The supporting cast is full of familiar faces: Zemeckis regulars Marc McClure and Wendie Jo Sperber as Marty's siblings, Billy Zane and Casey Siemaszko among the members of Biffs' gang, George DiCenzo and Frances Lee McCain as Lorraines' parents, James Tolkan as slacker-hating principal Mr. Strickland, Will Hare as old farmer Mr. Peabody, Buck Flower in one of his many hobo roles, etc. Music star Huey Lewis, who performs the films' hit song ""The Power of Love"", has a cameo as a teacher who tells Marty that his bands' music is ""too loud"".With a high energy level, a large amount of humour that actually works, and excellent visual effects by those pros at Industrial Light & Magic, ""Back to the Future"" has proven to have real legs in terms of its enduring entertainment value.Followed by two sequels and an animated TV series.Eight out of 10.","

"KUAlum26","12 March 2006","HAve you ever had a movie experience from years before(let's use as an arbitrary number,five years or more)that was so vivid,so exhilarating that you could recall what day,time and even things as seemingly easy to forget as the smell and tastes of the popcorn and soda you had at the movie?For me,that was this movie,and I recall seeing it on a Sunday afternoon in July,1985. The noise and visuals were so electric that I enjoyed this film immensely. My only regret about the experience was that I didn't get a chance to redeem the ""Free Pepsi with purchase of large popcorn""discount coupons they were giving out that day!In a pleasant,average California suburb,ordinary teenager MArty McFly(Michael J.Fox,who was a youngish 24 when he filmed this) dreams of being a rock guitarist as he works his way through school,helping out brilliant-but-fringe local scientist Dr.Emmitt Brown(Christopher Lloyd,adding to his wide range of characters). When an unforeseen crisis interrupts Doc Brown's breakthrough time-machine revelation,MArty is thrust into the machine and becomes the unwitting first participant in time-travel. As if that weren't harrowing enough,he's just found a way to break up his younger parents BEFORE they met and now he has to feverishly find some way to get them back together,lest he and his sibs will never be born.If you can suspend some level of disbelief while watching this(and,really,when SHOULDN'T you suspend some disbelief when watching Spielberg/Lucas/Zemekis style of sci-fi films?),this film is as smooth as silk and one fun ride! Besides Fox and Lloyd,Crispin Glover(lovably strange and pathetic as Marty's once and future dad,George),Lea Thompson(cute and vapid as once and future mom Lorraine)and Thomas Wilson(thick-headed bully Biff,who is a lost treasure here,too) are excellent in fleshing out the characters that stick in one's mind regarding this film. Heck,Old MAn Peabody,Goldie Wilson,Jennifer PArker,MArvin Berry(cousin of Chuck)and the persistently bald and serious-as-heart-attack high school principal all add their own flairs in this movies persona. Robert Zemekis parlayed his ""Romancing the Stone"" success to create an even larger-than-life action-fantasy-comedy,with help from plenty of sight and sound FX and a hugely energetic soundtrack anchored by Huey Lewis and the News(remember them?). This film isn't just a renter,this is a keeper! Most people with a sense of fun who long for the eighties movies that accented style over dark or haunting substance should definitely buy this one,tape or DVD.","

"lee_eisenberg","23 September 2005","Okay, so maybe ""Back to the Future"" seems a little hokey, but it's so cool! You probably know the story: typical '80s teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back to 1955. His existence is threatened when his mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) falls for him instead of his father George (Crispin Glover). Only the zany Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) can help him. Along the way he has to cope with local bully Biff Tannen.If the movie is excessively nostalgic, then they play it to good effect. I sometimes have to wonder what would happen if I accidentally went back in time and met my parents. Given what happens in this movie, it's probably best that I stay in my own time.Anyway, it's an interesting contrast/comparison between the '50s and '80s. After all, who in the '50s would have imagined Reagan becoming president, or any town having an African-American mayor? So check this movie out; it won't disappoint you.","

"CuriosityKilledShawn","29 January 2016","Now more than 30 years after its release it's virtually impossible to review BTTF and say something that is new. Almost all observations of the film have already been made and the chance that my review will seem stale and familiar has put me off for years, but now is the time to finally get it done.Since there are as-of-yet undiscovered tribes in the heart of the Amazon jungle who already know the plot of Back to the Future I will forgo typing out a synopsis. Time travel is a tricky device when plotting movies. It can work in your favor or it can destroy you. Both the Terminator and Star Trek have suffered under the paradoxical strain of time travel. I suppose the main lure of the concept is the chance to go back and live key moments in your life and do them differently, putting right what once went wrong - the lifetime pursuit of Doctor Samuel Beckett.Back to the Future is a pop culture giant for many reasons. The iconic poster art, the fire trails, the instantly recognizable DeLorean, the title font, the costume design, the locations, Alan Silvestri's thrilling score, Huey Lewis' emblematic theme tune, but mainly for the dual time period. 1985 was present day when it was released but as I type this review it is 31 years in the past. In 1985 the western world still had a naive innocence, a hope that the future could be bright. Culture was hedonistic, optimistic, willing to experiment. In the three decades since then we have become bitter, pessimistic, and cynical. Dystopia, dysfunction, and distrust has permeated the majority of households. We are no longer a society that plans for the future, only to struggle through the day-by-day grind of increasingly hopeless existence. We long for the glory days of 1985 and Back to the Future allows us to access that dream.But there was an even more naive and innocent time, a world that Marty McFly finds himself trapped in with only a chance lightning strike to send him back home. 1955 Hill Valley (or Kingston Falls if you look at it from a Gremlins perspective) is a post-WWII Utopian Americana where the streets are clean, the world is safe, and the lifestyles are wholesome. It's a rose-tinted insight into forever gone era. Society has grown darker and darker over the decades. We all wish we had a nuclear-powered time machine to stop this ever-declining spiral and skew the timeline into an alternate present.Back to the Future is a good movie, a great movie, a perfectly cast and acted movie, an all time best and a classic for all the right reasons, but its main appeal is that it makes the viewer think ""what if I had that chance?"" I think most people would sacrifice their comfortable familiarity of their known present to go back in time and radically change the future for the better, and what better style to do that in than a DeLorean?This movie will never age. It's an icon of its era and a movie that defines an entire decade. It will stand the test of time (pun intended) and will appeal to each new generation for all of the above reasons. That's just the power of love, man.","

"screenman","23 September 2008","I love this movie. Although aimed primarily at a younger audience on account of its high-school-aged hero, there's really something for everyone.It's got adventure. It's got excitement. It's got danger. It's got great comedy. And it's got so much more.Released in 1985, its special-effects are minimal, and thankfully predate the now-obligatory CGI, requiring some practical imagination to make the thing seem plausible. Basically; everything's in the DeLorean sports car. After that, what is needed is an authentic representation of the 1950's. I'm no expert, but the period seems believable to me.Camera-work, lighting, and sound-effects are top-drawer. There are some wonderfully realised ambiences. Music - both incidental and theme are well chosen. Huey Lewis And The News supply the anthem 'Power Of Love' in fine, thumping riff, whilst additional pieces give a tremendous sense of urgency. It really is spot-on.This movie brought the unfortunate Micheal J Fox into deserved prominence. His acting skills and comic timing are excellent, here. It's so sad that incurable illness has blighted such a promising career. He and Christopher Lloyd make excellent foils. They are naturals as a comic duo.Young McFly goes back in time to find his young father as a bullied wimp, a failed writer, and a peeping-tom. He also accidentally upstages his father in his mother's eyes and risks a dose of temporal incest. Somehow he has to put things right before going back to the future. He does - but some details get overlooked, with funny and happy consequences. Relationships are handled with a light and deft touch. It never plods. It never becomes maudlin or lachrymose or excessively sentimental.There are several plot-holes in the story. And if you get hung-up on the stuff about time-travel and paradox crap, you're missing the point. You're not supposed to take it seriously. It's a fun movie! And it delivers in spades.Some have described this as the best time-travel movie and I'm inclined to agree. If you can't find something to laugh at then you're a lost cause.Being so successful, two sequels followed. But the surprise was gone and the humour grew progressively stale. they paled by comparison.Check-out the original. It's a collectors item and a truly great feel-good experience. I ought to give it 10 stars.","

In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read ""IT"" by Stephen King or watch ""Twin Peaks"" by David Lynch for examplesThe next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom.The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!). It was a bit hard to really figure what happened, the same way my mother would be after seeing part 2 !","

"Vartiainen","4 November 2015","I recently celebrated October 21, 2015 by re-watching the Back to the Future trilogy. And they were amazing. I had quite honestly forgotten just how good they were, just how funny, innovative, crazy, fast and quotable. And this is the one that started it all, and is easily the best film in the whole trilogy, which is saying a lot, keeping in mind the utter amount of quality all of them have.We all know the story. Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) has invented a time machine, and wants his young friend Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to act as a witness for the first trial run. But things don't go as planned - do they ever - and Marty is flung back into the past where he has to figure out how he can get, you guessed it, back to the future. Great, amazing basic story, but what really makes this one of the most iconic time travel films ever made is the amount of detail they put into the world and the characters. The very first scene, for example, of Marty stepping into Doc's house looking for him is filled with vast amounts of little touches that all tell a story, both about Doc and Marty.And the movie just keeps going. All of the characters are very memorable and just the right amount of over the top and exaggerated. From Marty's ultimate wimp of a father George (Crispin Glover) to Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), who's such a massive Hollywood bully that it's a wonder he hasn't spontaneously combusted from sheer stereotypicality. But all that's part of the fun and the characters are played so well and the movie is so light in tone that their over the topness actually works for the film's advantage.The score by Alan Silvestri is also fantastic, one of the most iconic movie soundtracks in cinema history. Whenever the main theme blasts from the screen you're flung straight into an adventure. The special effects are also surprisingly decent. Sure there are some obvious computer effects, but they were very good for their time and luckily the film relies mostly on practical effects.Saying anything more would frankly spoil the movie too much. But trust me when I say that this is one of the finest adventure films ever made. It's cinema enjoyment distilled into its purest form. It's a sin I hadn't seen it in such a long time. A mistake which shall not be made again.","

"sethn172","21 February 2006","I love the ""Back to the Future"" movies so much! These movies are a part of my life. In fact, I know about 99.9% of just about everything to memory! Plus, every time I watch these movies, I always find something new, interesting, or something that never really caught on to me before! That is how much I love ""Back to the Future."" I like part one because this is where it all begins. The beginning part with the dog feeder (the robotic arm, electric can opener, and a very funny whirring noise) and quite possibly the biggest amp in the history of the universe with that weird, rising ethereal hum got me on the floor, not only laughing, but imitating that part of the film, too! What about everything in Marty's house, from the TV playing ""The Honeymooners"" rerun to that ugly Panasonic clock radio? Priceless! Ooh, don't forget the JCPenney lot of the mall (which will remain unnamed because I'm not turning on the spoiler alert for this review) with the van and the DeLorean time machine coming out! Just watch this movie for more stuff! Oh, and to let y'all know: I've seen the three movies on DVD and I love them very, very much!","

"Laakbaar","20 February 2015","I want to add my voice to the many who have reviewed this 1985 classic positively. It's a simple and fun movie with a wild and far-fetched story. Marty McFly, with the aid of his mad scientist friend, is able to travel 30 years into the past, where he meets his parents when they were his age. He both prevents history from being changed and yet changes it for the better. A lot of the laughs comes from comparing the town in 1955 and 1985. The film has fully fleshed out characters and a heart-warming, satisfying feel. It's hard to forget how popular this film was when it was released. This movie has withstood the test of time because it can certainly be enjoyed 30 years later.","

"kenbo-87360","27 March 2023","I'm a 44 y/o man and I still love this film. Me and my wife probably watch it half a dozen times a year (and the other two films!). I've watched it hundreds of times, I actually wish I knew exactly how many times I have watched it. I will never get bored of it though. It still makes smile when I watch it. It still makes my heart flutter when I hear the incredible score, or when Huey Lewis's The Power of Love kicks in.It hasn't aged a day either. So many films from the 80's have aged so poorly, not BTTF. It still looks like it was made today.I often wonder if we (BTTF Superfans) would still love it so much if Eric Stoltz had kept the part of Marty. I don't think I would've done. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd made it what it was.Thank you to everyone involved in making this film. It has kept me entertained for so many hours of my life, and it will do until the day I'm gone.10/10. The best film ever made.","

"a_chinn","14 July 2021","My my kids got two days in a row of my pandemic Film Appreciation Course, this time introducing them to the 80s time travel classic ""Back to the Future."" My kids laughed at all the right parts, thought Marty and Doc funny, and were completely caught up in the excitement and suspense of the clocktower finale. During that clocktower finale, one of my daughters, who wasn't familiar with ""suspense"" as a film term said ""This movie is giving me ANXIETY!"" They were completely into the film, just as I was when I was 13 or 14 when I first saw it in the theater. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, who only had three movie credits to his name before this, the very funny TV movie ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand,"" the very funny and very crass Kurt Russell comedy ""Used Cars,"" and then ""Romancing the Stone,"" which was an unexpected hit that led the studios to take a look at his other projects. If you're wondering how Spielberg got involved in this film, Zemeckis and his writing partner, Bob Gale, wrote Spielberg's infamous bomb ""1941,"" which I think is an under appreciated comedy classic I still love to this day. Spielberg also produced Zemeckis' first film ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and when the studio was uncomfortable with him selecting a first time director he stuck by Zemeckis but had to promise the studio if things went badly he'd take over as director. But I digress. In summary, ""Back to the Future"" has a great cast (even look fast for Billy Zane in his film debut as one of Biff's toadies), terrific humor, and genuine heart. Although seemingly lightweight, ""Back to the Future"" really is an American film classic. FUN FACT(s)! When Thomas F. Wilson, who played Biff, is asked about this movie by fans, he'll often hand them a postcard of frequently asked questions as a timesaver, which reads:""I'm Tom Wilson. I was in all three 'Back To The Future' movies. Michael J. Fox is nice. I'm not in close contact with him. Christopher Lloyd is nice. He is a very shy man. Crispin Glover is unusual, but not as unusual as he sometimes presents himself. We got along nicely. Lea Thompson is nice. Eric Stoltz originally played Marty, but was fired due to performance issues. The first movie was shot in 1984 and '85. The sequels were shot 'back to back,' never before attempted by a movie studio. The hoverboards didn't really fly, we were hanging by wires from a crane. The manure was made of peat moss, cork, dirt, and a food agent that made it sticky. The Delorean was an inferior automobile, and nearly impossible for a person of normal size like myself to enter and exit. There are many tiny plot points hidden in the movies, but I don't know what they are. Among many improvisations of the set, I coined the term 'butthead,' as well as 'Make like a tree, and get out of here.' The third movie was my favorite, since I got to learn western skills like riding, roping, quick draw, and shooting a six-shooter, a great adventure for a guy from Philadelphia.""","

"WeAreLive","3 October 2022","Marty McFly's life is a dump. His father, George, is constantly bullied by his supervisor Biff Tannen and his mother, Lorraine, is an overweight alcoholic. One day, Marty gets a call from his scientist friend Dr. ""Doc"" Emmet Brown telling Marty to meet him at Twin Pines Mall at 1:15 AM where Doc unveils a time machine that runs off of plutonium built into a DeLorean and demonstrates it to Marty. Marty accidentally activates the time machine, sending him back to 1955 where he accidentally gets in the way of his teenage parents meeting. Marty must find a way to convince Doc that he is from the future, reunite his parents, and ultimately get back to the future.This film was an excellent start to the trilogy and a real classic.It was an excellent experience from start to finish. Sure I will admit I didn't grew up with any of these film as I only saw them for the first time earlier this year but I can definitely see why it popular.The acting was excellent as was the music.My only issue which probably only something small, while the film is called back to the future, Marty doesn't go into the future but rather the past, which I am guessing was reserved for the next part I will be reviewing.All and all great film definitely recommend.","

"gcd70","29 May 2007","""Back to the Future"" is the most entertaining, fun-filled movie of all time. Not to mention the fact that after first seeing this at the age of fifteen (and going back for more ten times), it remained my very favourite film for years.Absolutely wonderful balance of humour, drama and fantasy that finds teenager Marty McFly accidentally transported back in time to 1955. There he inadvertently prevents his parents from meeting, and thus sets off an hilarious chain of events; all of which he must fix before he goes ""Back to the Future"". Fox is perfectly cast as Marty and Lloyd is in outrageously funny form as 'Doc' Emmette Brown. Alan Silvestri's music and the incidental pop soundtrack are very enjoyable. The script from co-writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is pure genius. Special effects are brilliant! Pure entertainment!!Monday, June 10, 1991 - Golden Twin Cinema, BendigoOnce again pure adventure and entertainment. A perfect combination of comedy and fantasy. Filmed well and great fun to watch!Wednesday, January 15, 1992 - Laser DiscI still recall the first time I ever saw this pic. It was September the 14th, 1985, and as an unsuspecting fifteen year old, I went along by chance to see ""Back to the Future"" at the Balwyn Cinema (then only a single cinema complex). I was totally blown away, and rushed out to see it again twelve days later, at the old Forum cinema (remember that place?), being bedazzled once more. Several excursions later (including a few to the Australia Twin in Collins St.) and I still couldn't get enough.This was my twelfth trip to the movies to see this blockbuster of 1985. Eleven and a half years on, it is now difficult to fathom what attracted me so inexorably to this highly entertaining, yet hardly classic film. Perhaps Rob Zemeckis and Bob Gale's ingenious story of bewildered teen Marty McFly's journey back in time is finally wearing thin on me. Oh what sacrilege.The fact remains though that this film is, as I've said many times before, pure entertainment. Visual and sound effects during the time traveling sequences are dazzling, art direction and set decoration both brilliantly recreate 1955 (they received an Academy Award nomination) as do costumes. Zemeckis and Gale were also nominated for their script.The pop soundtrack, including Lindsay Buckingham, Eric Carmen and Huey Louis and the News, was instrumental in the film's success, and Alan Silvestri's music is an unsung hero in the proceedings. Finally, the cast are a real delight. Fox is the perfect choice for the fish-out-of-water McFly, and Christopher Lloyd is superb as the nutty Doc Brown. Lea Thompson is suitably smitten as Marty's mom, Lorraine, and Crispin Glover is a scene stealer as the geeky George McFly, whether he is under a ton of make-up - aged forty-seven - or bumbling around as a seventeen year old in 1955. Thomas F. Wilson is fun too as Biff Tannen, the bane of the McFly's existence.One hundred and twelve minutes of absolute fun!Monday, March 31, 1997 - Astor Theatre","

"jeremycrimsonfox","4 May 2020","Marty McFly is a teen living in Hill Valley who is called a slacker for hanging out with Dr. Emmet Brown, whom his principal says he should stay away from for being a nut job. His family is falling apart, as his father is bullied by supervisor, Biff Tannen, and his mother is an overweight, depressed alcoholic. All that changes when he meets Doc at the Twin Pines Mall, who reveals to the youth who is his only friend his latest invention: a time machine built into a DeLorean. However, Doc is gunned down by Libyan nationalists he ripped off to get the plutonium needed to power the vehicle, and when Marty takes it to escape, he ends up traveling back to November 5,1955, a date Doc put in while showing Marty how the time travel mechanics work, where he immediately puts his existence in jeopardy by getting his mother to crush on him, leading him to find the younger Doc in order to set things right before he no longer exists, and get back home, as the time travel depleted the plutonium.This is one of the cult classic films of the 1980's. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd make a good duo in this film, Also, the story is great, as it has Marty trying to correct history after his arrival in 1955 causes the teenager who would be his mother to fall in love with him, and the action scenes and special effects are great.","

Earlier I watched the movie in hindi dub and to be honest I didn't enjoy the movie that much. Today I watched the original english version and I totally enjoyed it. The story was enjoyable, the performances were also enjoyable and the ending was also left at cliffhanger which I thought was a smart move. Now, I am excited to watch the sequels which I haven't watched yet.Overall, it was a good movie which I would recommend to everyone.

"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","22 October 2015","Ah, distinctly I remember, it was my grandfather (may he rest in peace) who first showed this film to me, on video when I was a very small child. It was him and his second wife, and two of their friends, and me, and distinctly I also remember vividly immediately after the film was over, I said, ""I want to watch it again!"" 30 years after its initial release, this is still a hilarious, wonderfully wacky sci-fi/ comedy/ romance/ action flick, and one of the very few films which even attempts to cover all of those bases, and does so extremely well, as it sends a 17 years old 30 years into the past in a DeLorean built by a nutjob inventor, Doc Emmet L. Brown, brilliantly played by Christopher Lloyd. An over-the-top satire of mad scientists, when he shouts, ""It works!"", it reminded me of Dr. Frankenstein shouting ""It's alive!"", upon seeing his creation. Even the film's ending still had suspense, I was still on the edge of my seat (as the cliché goes) when Doc was on the edge of the clocktower, lightning bolts crashing and crackling, again similar to film Frankenstein's creation of the monster. There is also a sad, tragic feel to a few scenes, as Marty fears for his friend's life. As Biff, Thomas Wilson is hysterical also, the kind of over-sized nitwit most of us knew in high school, who we waited to see get their comeuppance. A childish baby, stuck in a large man's body. Some well selected and timed oldies, and original score was perfect, not a single note misused, nor was there a single line of dialogue misused, out of place, or unnecessary. The same can be said about the cinematography, which includes several of Dean Cundey's long takes (opening shot in the Doc's garage, and the unveiling of the DeLorean. One of my all time favourites, 10/ 10, easily. Upon seeing it again in the cinema yesterday (21 October 2015, Back To The Future day) me and the entire audience were in stitches all throughout, and the film actually received a standing ovation when it finished.","

"jboothmillard","16 June 2005","If you like science-fiction films, then you'll love this from director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) and executive producer Steven Spielberg. Basically Marty McFly (Golden Globe nominated Michael J. Fox) is the young aspiring teenage musician and friend of Dr. 'Doc' Emmet Brown (a fantastic Christopher Lloyd), and finds out that Doc has invented a time machine with a DeLorean car. It is run by tremendous power from plutonium, which he took from the Libyans, who find him and shoot him. When Marty escapes from them in the car and excels to 88mph (the speed needed to time travel) he is transported unintentionally to 1955 (which Doc set). Unfortunately, while looking for Doc to help him get home, he interferes with the history of his parents in this past, where they meet and fall in love, making his mother love him! Marty now not only has to get his parents, George (Crispin Glover, who did not return for the sequels) and Lorraine (Les Thompson) to fall in love again to restore history/the future, before he and his brother and sister are erased from existence, but the only power available instead of plutonium to get him back to the future (1985) is a bolt of lighting that will hit the clock tower (they know this from a paper he brought from 1985). A fantastic look at how time is so precious, and what can change from the tiniest history interference, aka time paradox. By the way, the plutonium was changed to trash in the end to help explain the sequels. Also starring Thomas F. Wilson as Biff Tannen, Claudia Wells as Jennifer Parker (who was changed in the sequels to Elisabeth Shue) and Titanic's Billy Zane as Match. The story is original and though provoking, the characters are lovable, and the special effects are great, just a great film. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing, and it was nominated for Best Song for ""The Power of Love"", Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Production Design, Best Screenplay, Best Special Visual Effects and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, Best Original Song and Best Screenplay. It was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Outstanding!","

"oneguyrambling","27 December 2011","About once a decade a film emerges that is so original and new that it immediately raises the bar for the rest of mainstream cinema to aspire to, films that are both critically espoused and well supported at the box office.The 70s brought us Star Wars and The Godfather (1 & 2), the 90s The Matrix, Toy Story and The Sixth Sense gave us the 'big twist' ending (for better or worse), the dubbos The Lord of the Rings trilogy (seriously, how many times has it been ripped off already?) and perhaps Avatar, and this decade so far has Inception, which although flawed is an admirable attempt at breaking the mould and creating something distinctly original.The 80s was all about the adventure (Indiana Jones), Blade Runner must be mentioned and the introduction of the macho action hero (Arnie, Bruce, Sly) but at equal 4th on the IMDb Top Ranked 80s titles is a 'little' film called Back to the Future, it didn't need big explosions, huge car chases and thousands of rounds of ammunition, just a creative plot and some likable characters to inhabit it.And really that's the entire Back to the Future (BttF) trilogy in a nutshell. The films don't have a huge number of jokes, the action is OK but not mind blowing and there is essentially zero sex and violence. What it does exude in abundance is charm, charm which starts with the most likable 5 foot tall guy of the 80s and 90s, Mr Michael J Fox.Fox plays Marty McFly, a typical 80s 'teen' from Hill Valley obsessed with girls (namely his girlfriend Jennifer), skateboards and music. His family are also typical and loving, his Dad (Crispin Glover) is a nervous and timid wallflower and his Mum is slightly strict but well meaning. The entire family – especially Dad – is pushed around by a local moron named Biff who has tortured him since school age.To blow off steam McFly has a friendship with a local eccentric scientist named Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc's dabbles in everything scientific and has hundreds of wonderful inventions, none of which have set the world on fire.But all of that is about to change.Doc's latest creation is a time traveling car (a DeLoreon to be specific) that when gunned to 88mph can FF or rewind to any pre-programmed point in history. McFly is dubious but he agrees at the insistence of Doc Brown to show up at an early morning (actually late evening) trial run in a supermarket car park.Using Doc's dog Einstein as the test pilot they give the car a try, and lo and behold the thing actually works! But before they even have a chance to high five and discuss how this new invention will benefit the world Libyan terrorists unexpectedly show up and gun down the Doc, with McFly only just managing to escape in the DeLorean.This one act sets in chain a series of incredible and intricately plotted events that span 3 centuries and several generations of McFly's (and 'Biff's' for that matter) Marty initially is transported back to 1985 where he is hopelessly out of place. While there he manages to meet his two parents before they even have a chance to get together, his actions inadvertently prevent this from happening, meaning that he must somehow play matchmaker to his own folks else he remove himself from existence altogether.There's a whole lot more to the original BttF, aside from literally justifying his own existence Marty manages to invent skateboarding and rock 'n' roll in his limited stay in 1955, all the while striving to avoid actions that somehow alter the future along the way.I obviously can't go into too much detail but the ending was excellent as well.Now some 25 years later time travel in films is commonplace – even Red Dwarf and Futurama have produced excellent episodes dealing with time travel paradoxes – and yes I know about The Time Machine and the 'classic' older films dealing with the topic (that I can't name). Back to the Future managed to take a science fiction core and make it interesting to the everyday movie watcher who just wants to be entertained for a couple hours (I am trying to say 'non-geeks'), the original BttF was/and is immensely original and creative, with solid performances plural by Michael J Fox as, well many McFly's.It isn't laugh a minute or gasp inducing but you'll go a long while before you find a mainstream film this innovative and enjoyable, and the sequel was even better! Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. Somehow I admire the 2nd film more, but without the elaborate set-ups structured in this film that wouldn't be near as effective, and this film is effortlessly entertaining in any case.","

Fox) is friends with an eccentric doctor who has become the world's first scientist to manipulate time using uranium and a delorian to take you anywhere you want to go at 55 mph.Marty coming from a troubled home with a father who's a push over, a mom who drunks to much and siblings who can't get dates or fine jobs tries to make a name for himself through music.But like the rest of the mcflys he can't beat the system until he goes back to the day his parents met and changes the destiny of his entire family.Using the grandfather paradox it answers the question on if you Go back in time and stop your parents from meeting do you cease to exist? Throughout the flick Marty notices a picture of his family slowly dissolving away into nothing until the climatic ending when he fades away until his parents fall in love.While it may or may not follow the scientific method to the letter it lead to creative choices that kept you wondering will he succeeded or not and the stakes are raised when you realize the universe may explode from the paradox it creates.What made this an instant hit besides the right script, wit, music and trade mark one liners is the desire to travel back witnessing history in motion hoping to change it or relieve it over again.Back to the future feels timeless and one you can watch over & over without getting bored.10/10","

"lagudafuad","28 December 2012","Back to the future is one movie that contains excellent visual effects, a nice story plot and the directing is just excellent. The movie has a beautiful screenplay, and the movie puts the full stop in the statement, ""never a dull moment.""Michael J Fox was the desired man cast to play the lead role Marty McFly, but he turned it down due to scheduling conflicts, so Eric Soltz was cast in his place. After filming had begun, Zemeckis and Spielberg felt Soltz was not portraying the character well enough and knew this was a casting error, so they had to re-cast and ask Fox to try and make time to be in the movie. So Fox had to re-arrange his schedule time to be able to shoot Family Ties (TV Series) and the movie at the same time, this recasting meant, an extra 3 million production cost, as all the scenes that Eric had done had to be redone and Fox was so busy, that it was said that he only got 5 hours of sleep a day at the time.Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is a teenager from the Eighties who befriends a slightly coco scientist Doctor Brown (Christopher Lloyd). During one of their meetings Doctor Brown mistakenly (due to an accident) sends Marty 30 years into the past, 1955 to be exact. Marty while in the past, mistakenly interrupts his parents meeting and he must find a way to fix it or else he will no longer exist. He also has to help the Doctor Brown of 1955 get him (Marty) Back to the future.Back to the Future was a financial success the movie's 100 days production cost was 19 million dollars (including the recasting cost) and it made over 380 million dollars in the box office. It was also a critical acclaim winning an Oscar for Best Sounding Editing.The balance in this movie is what makes it a most watch the movie's transgression from comic to science fiction to romance/drama, is what makes it such a most watch, it takes its time to explain even the complexity of time travel, that at the end even with the slightest of details that made no sense I actually was convinced and doubted not that Doctor Brown did it.Back to the Future is a movie hit for all to see and enjoy, it was that good that two sequels were added to it, Back to the Future II and Back to the Future III although the release dates for the sequels were 1989 and 1990 respectively all maintained the time of 1985 when the first time travel happened. So in the end of Back to the Future III, we were back in 1985.www.lagsreviews.com","

"snoozejonc","15 May 2021","A scientist invents a time machine that accidentally sends his young friend back to 1955.This is a classic adventure-comedy with great characters, sci-fi concepts and storytelling. Certain elements require a suspension of disbelief, however it's so enjoyable you get swept along with it.The plot is simple but superbly detailed in how it takes a number of characters through individual arcs and focuses on period details, particularly in emphasising the fish out of water angle of Marty McFly as an 80s kid trapped in his parents era. Practically everything that happens links to something else that occurs at a later point in the story. Whilst doing all of the above it takes us on a highly enjoyable and thrilling adventure.One of its biggest strengths is a sharp script that provides great comedy, lots of cultural references and quotable lines from many characters such as Marty, Doc, George, Lorraine and Biff.This is a movie with a number of memorable scenes such as at Twin Pines Mall, the Enchantment Under The Sea dance and the lightening bolt at the clock tower. In fact, the movie creates an almost living and breathing character out of the fictional town of Hill Valley as we have great scenes in numerous locations such as Lou's Diner, Lyon Estates and Courthouse in different eras.The visuals are brilliant with great cinematography, period detail, costumes and visual effects. The DeLorean car used as the basis for the time machine is an inspired creative idea and is rightfully now a pop culture icon.There is a fantastic soundtrack with a great mixture of original score and pop music. It goes without saying that the general sound mixing and effects are superb.Michael J Fox does a star turn as Marty and effortlessly carries the story with fantastic charisma and performance. He is supported wonderfully by Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson and Thomas F Wilson, who all play memorable characters in both time periods. Christopher Lloyd is a lot of fun as Doc Brown but occasionally strays over the top with a tendency to shout so many lines.The amazing aspect of looking back at it in 2021 is that you now see two past eras depicted.","

"cricketbat","28 December 2018","Back to the Future isn't only a great comedy and a thrilling sci-fi adventure, it's also one of the greatest movies ever made. Marty and Doc are timeless characters in an enduring story about standing up for yourself, taking charge of your destiny and matchmaking your parents. Plus, the years have only added another layer of nostalgia to this time-travel tale. Great Scott, Robert Zemeckis! You invented a classic!","

"Come-and-Review","3 December 2014","You can't review each movie alone, the trilogy is so bond together that it's impossible.Must say that this is one of the most memorable Sci-fi comedies or movies related to time- travel in the whole film making history. The story's great, you'll love the plot. Dr. Brown's explanations make sure that even the most complex things could be understood by everyone. You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all.","

"g-bodyl","1 October 2008","Back to the Future is a very good movie, better than I thought it would be. Everything is just about perfect with this film considering it came out in the mid-80's. The story is about a guy named Marty and his professor friend Dr. Brown. Brown invents a time machine in a car and Marty uses the car to travel to 1955 after a tragedy happens. While in 1955 and after messing up the way his parents met, he must fix this problem to avert another tragedy. The acting and directing in this film is great. The story is funny and some lines made me laugh like a hyena. The music makes the movie sound like a true 80's movie. ""Power of Love"" by Huey Lewis is an instant classic! Overall, this a movie classic for the ages. I rate this film a 10/10.","

"Fred_Maxwell","27 September 2008","It's hard to believe it's been 22 years since the original BTTF came out, so the fact that the movie is that old shows it truly is a CLASSIC in every sense of the word. I'm so glad they made this trilogy, what a wild ride it was. It certainly holds up to the test of time because it's just as fun to watch it now as it was back in '85. The world has changed so much since then and watching these movies is a nice escape from today's nerve wrecking reality. I wish I could get my hands on Doc's time machine so I could go back in time to fix the mistakes I made in my life... who doesn't!?! Cherish these movies and show them to your kids and grandkids... they will love them so much you can count on them sharing the adventure of Marty Mcfly and Doc well into their FUTURE!","

"pmtelefon","5 September 2020","""Back to the Future"" may be the most entertaining movie ever made. It hits on all cylinders. It's funny, romantic, emotional and very, very exciting. The last half hour or so is edge-of-your-seat stuff. The cast is perfect. They all deliver solid performances, especially Christopher Lloyd. Lloyd hits the ball out of the park. ""Back to the Future"" is as enjoyable now as when it came out. ( I saw it in the theater at MovieWorld in Douglaston, NY.) It truly is a movie that never gets old. Honorable mention: Alan Silvestri's music.","

"DomNickson843","10 February 2015","Excellent what's not to love about this film? I love absolutely everything about it. I love the whole idea of it taking place in the past and trying to get back to the future. It's always a pleasure to see Christopher Lloyd steal the show. In this film you get a true overview of the 80's and how hard it is to make it seem like he's in the 1950s because it's truly an 80's classic. I loved every minute of this gem and liked both of the sequels as well. This is my only review for this series but I loved all of them and give them all a solid 10 out of 10 because it's just the perfect example of how a true trilogy should be. Everything is great and hopefully we'll get those self-lacing shoes. It's a 10 out of 10 for this film!","

"Isaac5855","21 March 2007","BACK TO THE FUTURE is a roller coaster ride of an adventure that firmly established Robert Zemeckis as a director to be reckoned with and officially made a movie star out of sitcom star Michael J. Fox. Fox replaced Eric Stolz in the role of Marty McFly, a misfit of a teenager whose friendship with a loopy inventor named Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) gets him into quite the pickle. The Doc has actually invented a time machine that transports Marty back to the year 1955, where he meets his parents as teenagers and must unite them romantically in order to exist and return to the year 1985. This film is expertly mounted thanks to detailed direction and a rock solid screenplay. Fox is energetic as Marty McFly and gets wonderful support from Lloyd as Doc Brown and from Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson as his parents. Kudos as well to Thomas F. Wilson, who scores as a perpetual bully in Marty's life. The movie is full of laughs, scares, and even a touch of genuine warmth here and there. If you've never seen it, treat yourself. Follwed by two sequels.","

"Maniac-9","8 March 2012","Back to the Future is just one of those movies that no matter how many times you've seen every time you flip by it when channel surfing you always stop on that channel and watch it again. I've probably seen this movie a 100 times since I was a kid but if I stop on HBO and its playing I just can't help but at least watch a few minutes of it before returning to my channel surfing.Michael J. Fox was the absolute best actor to choose to star in this movie, he has great screen presence that whenever he's on TV he grabs your attention. It's such a shame the health problems he has had that such great skills are going to waste.The movie has so many great lines that I still quote to this day.","

"pmdhar","25 July 2014","One of the best movies EVER! Back the The Future is movie on time traveling. Time traveling has always been exciting and fun. I've watched this and About Time which are movies about time traveling and both are awesome. BTTF is TOO Awesome. Couldn't believe this was a 1980s movie.BTTF trilogy is an incredibly awesome adventure taken by Marty McFly and Dr.Emmett Brown. Dr.Emmett Brown a crazy, funny scientist invents the time machine, the biggest dream of his life. And Marty who is his friend gets to be a part of this awesome adventure by mistake. The best thing about this movie is how it shows whatever happens is bound to happen whether you want or not. And how with change in your attitude or with some help you can completely change your whole life. ""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" - Dr. Emmett Brown Back to the Future is an amazing movie. This 1985 movie is so much better in quality as compared to the movies nowadays which have a shallow impact on the audience. You will actually feel connected to the movie and glued to your seats till the end There are not many movies of 8.5-like rating which are packed with Comedy, Drama, Adventure of such level... It's a MUST WATCH for all.Hope you all enjoy it too. Cheers!","

"Cinemaniac1984","22 December 2015","Back to the Future is one of those movies with everlasting appeal that everybody loves to watch. Who would have thought when this was released 30 years ago back in 1985 that it would forever remain etched in everyone's memories and in movie history as one of the greatest blockbusters of all time. With its cleverly intelligent story and the perfect blend of science fiction, comedy, adventure, and romance, director Robert Zemeckis struck gold with this one of a kind movie that can never be duplicated. It also goes without saying that nobody can go past Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown. Mention any of those actors and without a doubt Back to the Future will always pop up as one of their most memorable movies.Back to the Future takes place in the fictional town of Hill Valley, California. Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is an aspiring musician who is dating Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells) and lives with his dysfunctional family. His weak willed father George McFly (Crispin Glover) is bullied mercilessly by his boss Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and his mother Lorraine McFly (Lea Thompson) is an unhappy alcoholic. While she disapproves of Marty's relationship with Jennifer, Lorraine recounts how she met George when her father hit him with his car. On 26 October 1985, Marty meets his friend the eccentric scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd in one of his most memorable roles) at a shopping mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean and powered by plutonium stolen from Libyan terrorists. When the Libyan terrorists track down Doc Brown, Marty manages to escape however inadvertently finds himself transported back to 5 November 1955. Marty finds himself in a time where his parents George and Lorraine are teenagers and are yet to meet, Biff is still a bully, and Doc Brown is still developing the very early stages of a time displacement machine but is still the same eccentric scientist only 30 years younger. Not only must Marty find a way back to 1985, but he must also not tamper with history otherwise he may never be born.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are tailor made for their respective roles as Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown. Both of them will forever be remembered for this movie. They are just fantastic! Writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have put in a lot of attention to detail with the comparisons between 1985 and 1955 as well as how the timeline may be affected for the McFly family and Hill Valley. With its quirky take on the time travel genre, the whole thing is cleverly written. The special effects for its era are top notch and Alan Silvestri's score is very memorable. Huey Lewis' theme song for the movie The Power of Love fits perfectly with the movie.I could go on forever how Back to the Future is one of the best movies of all time. What more can I say? 30 years on Back to the Future has not lost its timeless appeal and audiences everywhere get a thrill out of watching the movie. Even whenever people approach Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd the main topic of conversation will always relate to Back to the Future. Followed by two clever sequels, Back to the Future will still remain a timeless classic.A well deserved 10/10.","

"naujo_","26 December 2022","The first time I watched this movie was back in 2019. I saw it on Netflix and my dad told me how he remembered watching it in theaters back when it came out in '85 and said he loved it. This made me curious so I watched it. The whole movie just has a great story, great soundtrack, wonderful characters, is funny, and the special effects were pretty great for a 1980's movie. I can't remember the amount of times I've re-watched this movie since then, all I know more than 20 times. This movie is so memorable and made me fall in love with the BTTF trilogy. But this film, the first, will always be my favorite one. I really love Micheal J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's acting, they make the film so lively and enjoyable. Overall 10/10, I'll never get tired of this movie.","

It's appeal is huge largely cause it's so genre-defying, it's a sci-fi, comedy, high school, action and by the third part even a western movie! The whole trilogy is great, although progressively gets weaker. Still even the last one is a blast and all three should be watched in order, since they make up one complete story. But the first one is the best for sure!","

"dee.reid","7 January 2007","Why is ""Back to the Future"" my favorite movie from 1985? Because that was the year I was born! I'll be turning 22 this year, as will this film. Robert Zemeckis has had an astounding career over the last half-century, with other hits including ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) and ""Cast Away"" (2000). But his best will always be ""Back to the Future,"" at least to me. In 1985, wacky, frizzy-haired scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents time travel, that is he builds a time machine out of a DeLorean. A series of harrowing events forces wise-cracking teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) to take the DeLorean for a test drive through time, 30 years back to 1955, before he was even born. Never mind the scientific improbabilities and paradoxes present in the script, but McFly must find a way back to '85, before his future is erased by events in the present. You see, he has inadvertently altered the course of events that will lead to his then-teenage parents (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson) meeting and falling in love, and now he must try to get them together with a young Doc Brown's help while also facing off against Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), the local tough. ""Back to the Future"" remains a comedy classic, due largely to its mix of special effects fantasy and laugh-out loud moments. The performances are excellent, especially from Fox, who is one of my favorite actors and I do wish him well in the future with his fight against Parkinson's Disease.10/10","

"Agent10","29 April 2002","This film will always be a classic. Some will call it corny, or even hokie, but it put a new spin on an old sci-fi storyline. And it was even funny! Granted, the whole concept was beaten into the ground with two sequels, the original film in the series demonstrates the timeless nature of this movie. History is always set in stone, but to provide the fantasy of minutely changing your current history is always fun to think about. This was also one of the first movies I actually watched in a theater, so I tend to have some sentimental value placed on this film. But then again, it's well deserved.","

"Terryfan","24 July 2015","Back To The Future is one of my most favorite movies ever created. Just everything about this film is pure golden I can't think of one thing that would make Back To The Future bad because it just one of those films that got something right from the start.The film gave us some of the most used and most creative catch praises that we are still using even more after the film's release. It's one of those films I can always sit down and enjoy because it everything that makes it a pure classic.The idea of Time travel is always pure interest and it made the film a hit from the Get go.The music in the film is just superb often times you'll find yourself thinking about the theme song because it really matches the film story throughout also ""The Power of Love"" from Huey Lewis and the News really works well to help with Marty McFly and his love for girl friend Jennifer.The cast did a excellent job with creating some of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema Michael J.Fox was brilliant as the film Main Protagonist Marty McFly he helped created a character that most could related to in their teenage years he was the right man for the job. Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown was no doubt the perfect choice, Christopher Lloyd has always been an amazing actor and like many grew up watching his performance in this film he was just phenomenal in this role one of the smarter casting choices ever he really brought the character to life. Thomas F.Wilson as Biff Tannen was quite the antagonist he just brought back all that we know and hate about bullies and makes you want to cheer for Marty.Using the DeLorean as the time travel car really gave the car it status as part of American motion picture history every time you see the DeLorean you think of Back To The Future. The effects in this film are nothing short of being magical and even today remains impressive.Back To The Future is like a fine wine only gets better with age that's saying something for this classic masterpiece I give Back To The Future a 10 out of 10 Great Scott! When this baby hits 88 miles per hour you're going to see some serious hit","

"slymusic","5 February 2007","From writer/producer Bob Gale and writer/director Robert Zemeckis comes one of the greatest and most beloved films of the 1980s: ""Back to the Future""! This well-made science fiction comedy has become such a favorite among so many people, myself included, that it is on its way to becoming a true classic. The story is just as enchanting today as it was in 1985 when this film was released, and the casting could not have been better.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are absolutely superlative in their respective roles as Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett L. ""Doc"" Brown. Marty is a high school teen from 1985 who accidentally powers Doc's time machine, made into a DeLorean, to transport him back to 1955. While in the past, Marty meets Doc's younger self, and one of the most heartwarming aspects of this story is the great rapport between Marty and the 1955 Doc, even though Marty initially has great difficulty trying to convince Doc that he's from the eighties and needs his help to get back to his own time; once Doc is convinced of Marty's honesty and earnestness, he indeed does everything he can to help Marty, and he ultimately succeeds. Credit must also be given to the beautiful Lea Thompson as Marty's mother Lorraine, whose younger self has become dangerously infatuated with Marty; Crispin Glover as Marty's father George, the most pivotal character in the story as he develops courage, with help from Marty, to stand up to some nasty bullies and ultimately win Lorraine's heart; and the congenial Thomas F. Wilson as the mean Biff Tannen, George McFly's arch nemesis.My favorite scenes from this charming movie include the following. At the opening, Marty strums one chord on his electric guitar and gets blown backward by the amplification in Doc's laboratory. Marty accidentally launches himself into 1955 by escaping a pair of Lybian terrorists (who hunt Doc down for stealing their plutonium) and crashing into a barn. Marty first encounters George's younger self at a small diner when Biff and his gang enter and antagonize George; this comically resembles an earlier scene in 1985 when Biff gives George a hard time after totalling George's car. Doc's horrified reaction to a videotape of his older self's mentioning 1.21 jigawatts of electricity is quite unforgettable! Biff and his thugs drive around town chasing Marty on a skateboard, but Marty outwits them and they end up crashing into a manure truck. In one of the greatest pivotal moments of the film, George doesn't realize his own strength when he knocks out Biff in one punch! And finally, at the dance, Marty sits in on guitar and plays a wonderful rendition of Chuck Berry's ""Johnny B. Goode,"" but he forgets that he is in the year 1955 and his heavy metal reflexes get the best of him.I don't think there is any doubt that ""Back to the Future"" is a truly remarkable film. The direction, the screenplay, the casting, the settings, etc., are all top of the line. Writer/producer Bob Gale commented that there is something about this wonderful story to which everyone can relate; in my case, I can easily identify with George McFly's lack of assertiveness since I was frequently picked on in school. To top everything off, Marty had absolutely no idea what kind of can o' worms he was opening near the beginning of this film when he told his high school principal (James Tolkan) that history was going to change, but when Marty finally returns to 1985 near the end, he realizes how much he has inadvertently changed things for the better!","

"heisenberg12","25 December 2020","The creativity of this movie is just spectacular. I caught it for the first time in over a decade recently when there was nothing else on, and being that it was the first time I had seen it from beginning to end in almost twenty years, it just blew me away, brought back so much nostalgia, and made me shed a tear at just how great it was. I just wish I hadn't seen it close to a hundred times as a kid going back to the 80s and 90s and it was my first time ever because even though as a kid it is fun and enjoyable, I'm sure if I saw this for the first time as an adult, it would be even more meaningful as far as filmmaking goes.It's just an absolutely brilliant movie that was so far ahead of its time in so many different ways and couldn't possibly be better. This is what a classic movie truly is, not the garbage the industry has been spewing out for the most recent many years that people try to parade around. Simply put, if you don't want to watch a movie over and over, then it's not a classic, no matter how good you want it to be on the first watch. Zemeckis is brilliant, and Forrest Gump proved he was no fluke.9/10","

A true classic, the story was great, along with the characters, and the soundtrack. It was the perfect blend of sci-fi, comedy,action. Doc Brown (Lloyd) invents a time machine using a DeLorean, to escape some Libyan terrorists after the Doc, McFly (Fox) goes back in time to 1955, and must use the assistance of 1955 Doc Brown to get back to 1985. Doesn't get much better than this as it appeals to all ages. Followed by 2 sequels part 2 is forgettable, but part 3 just as entertaining as original. 5/5.","

"ChrisTreborn","4 March 2005","When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE that 80s. IT'S SIMPLY THE GREATEST TIME TRAVEL MOVIE EVER HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF WORLD CINEMA.I firstly heard about this movie on Discovery channel, I didn't know much about it's importance, even it's title, then one day I happened to read television listings and was struck by a title named ""Back to the Future""..? Man what was that? Months later unexpectedly watch that on AXN channel. WOW, I was thrilled by its idea. Huh,.. I almost lost in that future..Back to the future (Spoilers******) Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car ""DeLorean"". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost ""chewed every scenes"" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs ""The Power of Love,"" and ""Earth Angel"".All in all it is the GREATEST SCI-FI, ROAMANTIC MOVIE OF THE ALL TIMES. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as "" A MODERN/CLASSIC MASTERPIECE! """" I gave this movie 10 thumps up out of 10 stars.""","

"Op_Prime","4 May 2000","Back to the Future is one of the most original and unique movie of the 1980s. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have great chemistry together, which the film benefits from. Tom Wilson is also great as Biff. Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale came up with a great script. Also great special effects. Thumbs up.","

"sandnair87","26 August 2015","Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a typical teenager growing up in the 80s. He hopes to make a man out of his milquetoast father, the middle-aged George McFly (a deliciously funny sad sack as played by 20-year-old Crispin Glover) who is still groveling at the feet of his former high school classmate, a perpetual bully named Biff. Marty's prim mother Lorraine (Lea Thompson) appears to be drowning her frustrations in vodka. The movie does not really catch fire until, when testing out a souped-up DeLorean as a time machine with his eccentric, wide-eyed, wild-haired stork of a mad scientist friend Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (played by the hilariously frazzled Christopher Lloyd), Marty is whisked back to 1955. Here, he comes face to face with his nerdy teenage dad and also his unrecognizably gorgeous mom. After inadvertently causing his own mother to become infatuated with him – who finds him an absolute dreamboat, it is left up to Marty to repair the course of time and ensure that she falls in love with his future father, George or face being erased out of existence altogether. To do so, he gets in touch with a young Doc, who is as much a fish out of water in the past as he is in the present, and persuades him to send him back to 1985. Can he put things right and return to the future before it's too late?Director Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future represents that rare perfect matrimony of everything a film needs to succeed, from the adroit direction, the immaculately styled performances and the scintillating visual effects that never swamp the film. The constituent elements would not operate without the film's biggest triumph – its screenplay – which is among the most economic and brilliantly composed, for there are no disposable lines of dialogue; everything spoken is either cuttingly funny and heartfelt (check Doc excitedly describing the forthcoming high-school dance as ""a rhythmic ceremonial ritual""), or employed to foreshadow a temporal event later in the film.Anchoring it all is Fox's stumbling charm. The boyishly good-looking Fox is charming as the lead, exuding cocksure – yet never arrogant – buoyancy. Lloyd, meanwhile, nails his Einstein-on-acid role perfectly, never venturing too far into caricature, yet spinning the archetypal mad scientist role with a wink and a nod, making it unquestionably his signature performance. Together, they make an idiosyncratic couple, for sure, but a perfect one at that.In Back to the Future, there is an effervescence to the filmmaking, a bubbling, giddy effortlessness that's almost addictive. It's ingenuity, time-traveling twist ups and wonderfully vibrant characters resonate in ways few films ever achieve. It is an unadulterated cinematic experience!","

"mbhgkmsgg","19 October 2020","I don't think that it's possible to describe how great this movie truly is. It manages to take you away to a different world and a different time for two wonderful hours.Everything from the clothing, to the music, from the set design, to the acting and the jokes, just works. There isn't a single thing in Back to the Future that I would change. There isn't a dull moment. Even the more serious scenes somehow manage to be lighthearted.Most importantly though, this film just gives me a wonderful feeling. I found myself smiling for almost the entire runtime. I somehow felt nostalgia to the 80s and 50s even though I was born in the late 90s. It is rare that a movie manages to make you feel so warm and fuzzy inside. Back to the Future manages that perfectly.","

"moviemattb","21 November 2015","It has been thirty years since this movie came out, and has now become a household name as everyone around the world makes references from each scene they reenact, quote lines from each character they say and make parodies out of it. ""Back to the Future"" is one of my favorite movies, and it is one of the best if not the best about time travel. There have been plenty of movies about time travel, but when it comes to time travel movies I think of this one. So with said, the movie is about Marty McFly who accidentally goes back in time to 1955 as he alters history by saving his father from getting hit by a car, and his mother for falling in love as well as his existence. So Marty has to put it all back as how things should be, while Doc Brown tries to get Marty back home to 1985. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd do work well together like bread and butter. Lea Thompson looks lovely and she really plays her role really well. The rest of the cast all did great. The movie itself is really funny, and it is also exciting too. The movie doesn't feature that many special effects by ILM, but I love the effects for the car traveling through time just as what it appears in the movie without any time travel sequence like having a portal or something. The design of the DeLorean for being used as a time travel vehicle is really iconic, and loved the way how it looks. The music by Alan Silvestri is so unforgettable, and loved hearing the theme that he created. The movie is very well scripted, and I thought Robert Zemeckis does a really good job on directing this movie after making another movie that is also good ""Romancing the Stone."" The production design for the 1955 scenes are outstanding, and I thought the pacing of the movie is top-notch. I really hope Hollywood doesn't try to remake this or the sequels, because they're fine for what they are; just like what everyone says ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" I have nothing against remakes, but sometimes it just gets lazy for Hollywood to try to come up with some new stories, and new ideas for what movie is there to make. So please, for one last time as I say this ""DON""T REMAKE THIS MOVIE OR THE SEQUELS!"" Now I got that out of my way, so now I need to wraps things up with this review, ""Back to the Future"" is definitely a classic movie, and really can't say no more about it. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.","

As far as I'm concerned...nothing ever will.I am so impressed with this movie that I don't even know how to end this comment aside of to state that if all films were made of this caliber, every movie would be a blockbuster.23 years later and this is till my favorite movie. It withstood the test of time, it never seems outdated...it is so cleverly structured and developed that if anything else ever comes this close to it, there might be some slim chance in hell that movies will be somewhat entertaining.Whenever the theme music comes on the speakers, I crank it up.Wow...what can I say that is negative about it? Only that I was not part of it...and yet, maybe that's a good thing.VERY IMPRESSED!!!!!!!!","

"hines_mark","22 April 2015","What else needs to be said? Anyone that knows anything about filmmaking knows that this is the best film ever made. Try watching certain movies over and over and see how quickly you get sick of it. This movie is different. The depth and richness of storytelling, the characters, oh my, the characters. Doc Brown is easily one of the best and most memorable on screen characters in any film ever. Biff, Griff, Buford...best on screen bully ever! Compare this movie to other epic movies, such as Star Wars - while those types of movies are great in their own right, Back to the Future is different. There is a warmth and comfort to the way that Bob Gale and Bob Zemekis crafted this screenplay. It's pure genius. And for all of you fans that always have to mention ""plot holes"" or ""minor flaws"" - please make sure you have seen every second of the 25th Anniversary set of the trilogy that has an entire bonus disc, as well as more bonus features and two different commentaries on the main discs. Bob Gale is aware of every little detail about his script and talks about it in the commentaries. My true love of this film came as a result of watching all the behind the scenes material - which if you haven't seen, you must see it if you're a fan of this movie. It will give you a whole new level of appreciation for this film. As someone that is into filmmaking and a total nerd about directing, cameras, technical details, I can't get enough of watching and listening to these guys talk about how everything came together just right for this masterpiece to happen. I can't say enough about this film, its actors and all the people involved in making it. Truly something not to be rivaled and we will probably never see anything close to it ever again.","

Didn't we all fantasize one way or the other of having a time machine ( even a Delorean at that ! ) Michael J. Fox is a fit shoe as Marty and the whole cast blends in like a smoothie in a blender . I beg those souls especially the younger ones to watch this film and just enjoy. This is entertainment best defined no doubt.","

"ccthemovieman-1","17 February 2008","When this came out over 20 years ago, I thought It was solid entertainment with a clever story. It was a big hit, and spawned two sequels. I saw it at the theater and several times on VHS. Then, after an absence of time, I saw it again in the late '90s and was shocked to hear 11 blasphemes - a ridiculous amount for a comedy (and ""PG-rated,"" to boot).Also, the character ""Biff"" (Thomas Wilson) was so irritating to me (he must have done a good job acting) it also fun out of viewing. I could say the same about ""Marty's"" father (Crispin Glover), who was a disgusting wuss. I did enjoy seeing Lea Thompson in her prime: a very pretty woman, and there were still a lot of laughs in here. She and Christopher Lloyd's ""Emmet Brown"" are definitely fun to watch. Michael J. Fox became an even-bigger star, thanks to this movie.The mixture of humor, action, drama, special-effects, science-fiction, etc., all made this a film a lot of people enjoyed. Why they had to include all that ""language"" is a mystery to me, except that it's the twisted world of Hollywood.","

It is so natural, like they'd been working together for years.I tend to judge films by how many ""memorable moments"" it has, that is, outstanding scenes that you remember and want to see again and again. This film has many such, more than any other film I can think of.If you are not a film fan, or not seen this one, watch it and you'll be hooked - forever!Incidentally, the Blu-Ray rendering of this film is easily the best I have seen for a film of its age.

"antimatter33","23 September 2020","Movies are, lets face it, supposed to be fun now and then. And this movie is, from start to end, fun, fun in all its forms, stupid fun, silly fun, love fun, fight fun, woo fun, it is just damned fun. You get a smile about a minute into it and it never leaves your face.But behind the fun is a deeper realm. Roger Ebert made the deep observation that this film is very much in the mold of Frank Capra, and in fact is very comparable to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", in which a life is reconsidered after magical intervention. In that film, although it is never quite stated, the main character is a rather faithless actor, and prone to self-pity and self-indulgence. Only by being shown his lesser side is he redeemed. That's a very Puritan message. At then end, one feels a little chagrined after a few viewings, to realize that there is this subtext of the role of will and the nature of sin. I didn't quite believe that George Bailey would not backslide into his dreamer self, and make life miserable again for his family. And in BTTF, Marty McFly and his formerly interesting family members are converted into 80s consumer drones, which also leaves one with a feeling of uncertainty about what has just been experienced.Oh - sorry about that - I was just thinking out loud. The script is great, the editing is great, the acting is great, the attitude is great, it's just perfect, a perfect movie, in tune with its time and slyly observant of 80s culture (well, suburban culture). Like all great films, you can see it again and again just for the fun of enjoying the craftwork.","

"madelynmcfly-20274","5 October 2022","This is one of the most perfect films ever. It's a masterpiece that has left its mark on pop culture - and for good reason. It's a classic-feeling film, with great acting, great shots and cinematography, and it's one of the best-plotted films ever. It's a film that doesn't have any major story flaws, almost all of the characters are memorable, and every actor gives their A-Game. So, on re-watch... It's a film I could never get tired of, and it's a great film on your 1sy watch, 10th, or 100th. It doesn't lose it's magic, and sometimes it's even better on re-watch...

Everything about this film feels right and it is nearly two hours of inventive comedy and pretty much anything else you would want from a really entertaining creation. All of the people involved in the making of this film should be congratulated on a job well done. I always enjoy watching it again and I will never lose my enthusiasm for this film. The film could have been released five years before or five years after 1985 and for some reason I do not think it would have had the same effect. We will never know but suffice to say that it is a splendid romp that does not fall into the trap of being too serious and therefore works remarkably well. I would recommend this film to anyone providing they are prepared to tune into the humour and if that happens it will be guaranteed to be an enjoyable experience.","

"donuthaters12","8 December 2013","Back To The Future is one of those films that is universally loved and is one of the most referenced contemporary films of all time. Has there been any other time travel film that has created such an impact as this film? Not that I have seen, but it is arguable as I have not seen many time traveling films.Back To The Future is written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale. I am just get this out of the way and say that both are not the greatest of writers but they did have created an a concept that is so ambitious and at the same time so accessible that it is hard to not appreciate their writing contributions. Back To The Future's premise is the reason we watch this film and it's the reason that we keep getting hooked to it. Back To The Future's plot is ambitious, at times too ambitious that certain plot holes may be present in relation to the impact of Marty's influence, and the film also has an abundance of humor scattered throughout the film. The humor is one of the main reason that the film is so accessible and beloved, the jokes can be related to both the younger generation and the previous generation even if either generation is from the 50-80s era. The story of just having Marty's mother be infatuated with him, and lightly touches on Freud's Oedipal Complex, is hilarious and ridiculous that it still has it's effect with every viewing. Back To The Future also manages to create the most unique of friendships, a high school student and a slightly off scientist, because these characters are so well written that I didn't really mind the unbelievability of their friendship. Both writers have created a protagonist that is very close to a real teenager during the 80's and made him so appealing that every adolescent males want to be him and all teenage girls want him.Robert Zemeckis now is regarded as one of the greatest contemporary directors and Back To The Future is one of the reasons why that is so. Zemeckis was able to execute a film that has such an ambitious plot while maintaining a campy coming of age tone that can appeal to a multi-generational audience. Back To The Future and Romancing The Stone definitely made Zemeckis an important director and those become a stepping stone for him to create films with more artistic license. Back To The Future was able to create this sense of nostalgia and walk a tightrope between two generations of adolescence. Zemeckis was able to project that ability to recreate a time of adolescent youth that is relatable and fueled by references that defined that time period; Zemeckis has definitely created something that was similar to what George Lucas did for American Graffiti.Dean Cundey started off as a cinematographer of the most popular Horror films of all time, including Halloween and The Thing. After working with Zemeckis on Romancing With The Stone, he did a complete turn around working in much more light-hearted and optimistic films. Cundey did a decent job here and was able to juxtapose two different looks for the film, the dark and dirty look for the 80s and the warm and colorful look of the 50's. Cundey's photography isn't as in your face with nostalgia, like The Godfather, as it consistently takes a more contemporary style throughout the film. Cundey shoots this film to serve the plot and maintaining that accessibility and light hearted tone that Zemeckis wanted instead of drawing attention to itself. The cinematography for this film may not be as loved as the film's writing or musical score but Cundey doesn't slouch with this film.Alan Silvestri was brought in to compose the score for Back To The Future and what a wonderful job he has done here. Silvestri's score here is one of the most memorable film scores that competes with other films like Star Wars and Indiana Jones. It has the ability to stick under your skin and will have you bobbing your head when it comes on. Huey Lewis' ""Power of Love"" is so catchy that it just stands out and had me singing the lyrics every time it comes on. The song is able to blend in with Silvestri's score which prevents me from drawing too much attention to it and feeling like it's out of place.Michael J. Fox is the star of this film, embodying this character who is a product of a rebellious and erratic generation. Fox brings personality to McFly by acting like how cool teenage adolescents were like in his time period. When he is sent back in time, Fox was able to portray this fish out of water kind of personality and emotion that makes his entrapment believable. Christopher Lloyd plays the slightly intense scientist who has created time traveling. Lloyd definitely has given such a memorable performance and nobody else was able to capture his performance in any other film. Lloyd was able to balance humor and the seriousness with such flourish that he was to place weight in the story of the scene. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover play Marty's parents and both do a very good job and was able to embody both their young and older self, though at times Glover at the start of the film was quite over the top and had me cringing a couple of times. Thomas F. Wilson was good as a cliché looking bully ""Biff"". He was able to give off this toughness quality that is able to make the McFly's feel inferior.Back To The Future by now is regarded as a classic and I can see why. This film will appeal to every generation and it's legacy will continue to grow as time passes. Back To The Future is still Zemeckis' best film and will forever remain as a timeless piece of cinema.","

"crash21","15 January 2016","""Back to the Future"" has to be one of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made, including the film's movie trilogy. It was great with the movie soundtracks and the amount of comedy running through the whole thing.The movie has to be everybody's dream at some point, he starts with a family that is partially wrecked by the father's lifelong bully, alongside his friend scientist shot dead, and (by accident) fixes it all in the past. With a lot of amusing comedy moments in between, one of the classic moments was the ""I hate manure"" scenes there were in the whole trilogy.I find it rather sad that most people seem to assume that the DeLorean car in this was just a special car made for the film, because that car was actually a more efficient car made in the 80's. Kind of like 80's version of today's Toyota Prius. Too bad the movie didn't get the DeLorean more popularly bought.Oh well, ""Back to the Future"" is a great movie, and to prove this, it is still a popular movie even today.","

"geminiredblue","22 October 2014","Time travel. Has there ever been a sci-fi concept that's gotten more mileage? H.G. Well's famous novel THE TIME MACHINE may have started it all. But to this day, imagination still booms at the possibilities of traveling through space and time. To witness historic events. Or even see where our world is heading in the future. Pop quiz: How many films can you name in 30 seconds that deal with time travel? Quite a lot, right?! In 1985, along came Universal Studios. Taking the well-worn ""Time Travel"" formula, they set out to make one of the greatest sci-fi/action films of all time. In a word, BACK TO THE FUTURE is cool! The story: Cool kid Marty McFly (played by Michael J. Fox) is friends with quirky scientist Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc has just built a time machine. Through a series of mishaps, Marty winds up back in the year 1955. Now, Marty's forced to track a much-younger Doc and convince the budding scientist to help him get back to 1985. Along the way, he's also bumped into his future-parents. Thus screwing up his own future. So now, he's got to find a way of getting his dad George (Crispin Glover) and mom Lorraine (Lea Thompson) to fall in love. But that's not going to be easy with the local bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson), hanging around. The rest I'll leave for you to discover. It's an instant classic with eye-popping special effects and a stellar cast. Followed by two equally-strong sequels. So if you haven't seen the BTTF trilogy yet, what's stopping you?!","

The cast and their chemistry on screen are unforgettable: Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly is an energetic teenager with a passion for music and someone who does not want you to call ""chicken"".Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown is a scientist who wants to invent something unique that works and to change the world. With his new invention of time travel that he made out of a DeLorean. Christopher Lloyd's performance was not nominated for an Oscar because his performance was the most fascinating part of the movie and one of the most interesting performances in a movie that I've seen in a long while. More praise goes to Chrispin Glover's performance as George McFly. He was my favourite part of the movie, especially the two scenes where he tries to woo Lorraine Baines and says ""I'm your density"" one of my favourite movie quotes. The moment in the film (SPOILERS just in case you haven't seen it yet) where he stands up to Biff surprised me and showed me that he could stand up for himself and the woman he loves. Lea Thompson was fantastic as well as Lorraine Baines.Back to the Future was something that surprised me because I never knew now how much I would love it. I don't know if I've ever felt this good about a movie in a long time since I first watched Jaws or Whiplash.10/10","

"v_haritha_in","27 August 2014","Time travel and the possibilities it offered, of altering the past, knowing the future, meeting people/beings from the future, has always fascinated people. Renowned authors from H.G Wells and Isaac Asimov to Charles Dickens have given their interpretation of time-travel. Hollywood too brought out movies like Terminator and the Star Trek franchise. They had all used it on a grand scale, to explore things like ethics and/or future societies. Nobody thought of placing it in a simple high-school setting and using it to comic effect until Back to the Future came along.A teenager, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally transported to 1955 (which is 30 years ago since the present day for this movie is 1985). There he interferes with the moment his high-school-age parents meet, to fall in love later, thereby endangering his own existence. To prevent that from happening, Marty has to play match-maker to his parents. What we have is a very entertaining comedy full of enjoyable characters like the eccentric scientist, Doc (Christopher Lloyd), the school bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) and his sidekicks, Marty's parents, Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover) and the school principal Strickland (James Tolkan). It also manages to have a few tense moments towards the end. It's funny, it's intelligent, and it expands the scope of time-travel by focusing on smaller events.","

"Robert_duder","4 August 2006","Here I am...wow...like it amazes me every time. This is my 400th review on IMDb. Three years or more, 400 films, some good, some REEEALLY bad and I hope everyone enjoys my reviews because I enjoy writing them and I don't plan on stopping. So for each 100 films I have reviews a Superman film being such a huge fan but for 400 I decided on something special...this film easily hits my top ten of all time favorites list so without further adieu...Back To The Future.Did they know they were making something this incredible when they were making it?? I think perhaps they did, that is part of the magic because Director and creator Robert Zemeckis holds nothing back from this flat out eighties classic fantasy adventure. The film is just so incredibly unique taking a cool, completely hip stereo typical eighties teenager and tossing him back into the mid fifties experience and forcing him to save his own existence by making sure his mother and father hook up. The special effects, the utter intense detail that goes into this amazing story line that makes sure everything flows properly, and captures not only 1985 vividly, but 1955 vividly. Zemeckie creates Hill Valley California from scratch and makes it feel like everyone's home town and he makes sure that we see every aspect of it so we can be as stunned and blown away by 1955 Hill Valley just like Marty McFly. This film is just brilliant.Marty McFly, a classic character in the history of film is played by the irrepressible Michael J. Fox in his hey day. Fox (although 24 at the time) was perfect as the 17 year old kid that everybody wanted to be, and everybody wanted to be his friend and for the course of the film you felt like you were right there along with him. This is without a doubt Fox's best role and he has had some good ones but this one takes the cake. He is so smooth and a fast talking, material driven, eighties kid and he's perfect. How can we forget Dr. Emmett Brown?? We can't!! Christopher Lloyd plays the most eccentric and yet brilliant Scientist inventor of the eighties. Doc, as he is known to Marty, is brilliant but almost to the point of insanity. It shows in his personality, his actions and his creations. His I.Q. is obviously off the charts. Despite the age different Doc Brown and Marty have this incredible friendship and Fox and Lloyd's chemistry reflect this strong bond between them. No one could have expected these two would be such a great pairing but they are!! Lea Thompson plays Marty's mother Lorraine Baines McFly. She spends more time playing the bubbly, rebellious teenage Lorraine and she's terrificly believable as both that role and as Marty's mother. Crispin Glover plays whiny, rather weak George McFly, Marty's father. Now I'm not a big fan of Glover and his personal decisions (such as suing the producers of the sequels to this film) had not made me like him any more but he truly created a unique and terrific anti hero in George Mcfly. I will forever associate Back To The Future with the nerdy annoying laugh and his petrified nerdy walk. Thomas F. Wilson is the bully that everyone wanted to see get his in the end Biff Tannen. Wilson is just terrific as a guy that you absolutely despise and yet he still strikes that feeling of dread when he shows up...he's the perfect bully and adversary to Marty AND his father in 1955. They share the same enemy. The cast mesh so well together and the transformations of thirty years between everyone in the cast with the exception of Michael J. Fox is really astounding. I mean sometimes the make up looks a little cheesy but it's really quite amazing to see them. You really feel like you're traveling in time.And isn't that what makes Back To The Future one of the most incredible adventures of all time. You're right there with Marty 100% of the time and you feel like you're going through everything that he is. The story is brilliant and in such a complex film about time travel there is BOUND to be plot holes but Zemeckis does an incredible job and barely making you notice them and wrapping things up so carefully and creating this incredible world around the characters. Back To The Future is not something someone might see, it's something every single person should see because it IS a classic film and always will be. To this day (20 years after the fact) Back To The Future holds up as well now as it did then against ANY big budget special effects film nowadays. It was years ahead of it's time making it the absolute must see. The movie has a kick ass soundtrack featuring a lot of Huey Lewis and The News tracks that became associated with this film (Power of Love--for instance), and it's the absolute quintessential eighties film...the power of wanting material things (Marty's truck, George McFly's book) social status based on appearance...that's the eighties way!! Throw in some what was then ""cool"" four letter words (not a lot but enough to make it feel naughty to the youngsters) and you got yourself everything that Back To The Future is. An incredible film that I have probably seen a hundred times and love it equally as much every single time. 10/10 THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEWS...100 MORE TO GO TILL 500!!","

"leosmith-11166","22 November 2015","""Where were going we don't need roads"". Back to the Future is full of 80s nostalgia, and is surely one of the most entertaining films of all time. Between the rocking soundtrack to the retro fashion(the life preserver!) Back to the Future is jam packed with everything 80s. The story follows a young teenager living in 1985, Marty McFly, who, accidentally is teleported back to 1955, using a Time Machine out of a Delorean. The most is extremely entertaining, and whether you enjoy the humour, the Sci Fi or both, you are sure to be entertained either way.Roberts Zemeckis direction helps the film reach fullest velocity. His script, which he also wrote, is very original and creative. Just Imagine if Back to the Future was never made, it's almost impossible to think about. The film is great entertainment for young and old, and sure will be a memory in your mind forever.","

"paologerardo","15 August 2021","Back to the Future is cinema history! One of the best blockbusters of the 80s and why not, of history. It has charismatic and endearing characters like Mary McFly (Michael J. Fox), Dr. Emmet (C. Lloyd), Lorraine (L. Thompson) and many more, an easy to understand story that has a very dynamic rhythm and obviously a soundtrack that is still remembered today. If you haven't seen it yet, I don't know what you're waiting for.","

"mark.waltz","14 February 2023","While Hollywood Studios have been making blockbusters for decades, it was in the 1980's when this crowd-pleasing genre became a regular part of the movie going lingo, starting with the Indiana Jones series and continuing with practically everything produced or directed by Spielberg, and finally spilling over to practically every filmmaker in the business. Practically every movie set for release in the summer had Blockbuster written all over it, and many of them ended up becoming franchises with sequels and product promotion, ultimately becoming collectors items not only for toys and gadgets sold in the stores, but video tapes and later video discs. Some of them have even ended up being adapted for the stage, and indeed, ""Back to the Future"" would ultimately become a musical spectacular.How then does the film hold up nearly 40 years later? I must say quite brilliantly, warranting two sequels and turning the already popular Michael J. Fox into a big star, rivaling Cruise, Broderick and Dillon in the list of guaranteed box office draws. The film is a crowd pleaser from the moment it starts, and Fox, along with the scene stealing Christopher Lloyd, truly guarantees his place in film history. The special effects are superb as it goes back in time to Fox's characters parents era, giving a glimpse into not only that time period, but an indication of how his community has changed, especially since the bully from his school was sired by the bully from his parents' era.There is a sense of eew as the teenage Fox from the '80s encounters his young mother years before she married his father, and not knowing who he is has a bit of a crush on him. It's as if some connection even though her character wouldn't know what the future would give her was right in front of her. This has many classic moments mixing comedy, romance, and science fiction, with jaw dropping effects still creating reactions and the question of how did they do that. Of course, films like this also inspired future filmmakers to get into the business, and the result is a film that will remain a modern classic even though certain elements aren't perfect.","

"kosmasp","23 May 2020","Doc Brown and Marty McFly ... character names that are very well known in the Science Fiction movie pantheon I'd say. Any self respecting movie fan should know the names, the actors and the movies that made them famous. Which in case of McFly and the series in general ... could have gone in a completely different direction - literally.Eric Stoltz got cast because the filmmaker could not get Michael J. Fox - had other contractual obligations. This is very well known. That his movie girlfriend was recast too, because the original one wasn't available at first - that I did not know. But it's all there and so much more in the Special features on the discs. Just the beginning of the movie is quite interesting and intriguing, because especially back then, no one knew what this was about. Well apart from the title of course.Very funny movie that sets off something in the careers of everyone involved. Yes the time travel aspect has flaws if you try to apply logic and consequences of certain actions and how they will spin out and what they will do - a ripple effect that is not entirely seen .. which would have been too complicated anyway.So sit back, relax and enjoy a very entertaining and funny movie","

"haydenluz","21 January 2021","Back to the Future, directed & written by Robert Zemeckis, originated and produced by the great Steven Spielberg, was this highly inventive, and I quote, ""heavy"" film! Back to the Future may not have been the first film to take a shot at time travel, but it's the film that broke barriers, and holds up the most out of Time After Time & Terminator, along with other early titles. This film is so heavily guarded; a lot of people say it's almost a flawless film, with good reason. Back to the Future has so many memorable scenes, having this original style, that many film makers later tried to mimic.Michael J. Fox, has his first major role in a motion picture, and he puts on a phenomenal & energetic performance, making his character, as Marty McFly, very bold, and entertaining! His character development throughout the film brings a lot of an enjoyable wit and comedy, adding great layers, so we can really care about his character. Christopher Llyod, who is most noticed for One Flew Over the Coo Coo's Nest, put on a trademark performance! Chris Llyod NAILED his performance! He carried himself with this quirky & loud, yet brilliant and thoughtful attitude, that was admirable to all. His character development during the second and third act was the best out of all the characters! Thomas F. Wilson played a great, stereotypical bully, in Biff. He was a cliché character, and meant to hate, but he is absolutely hilarious.The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale was ahead of it's time, along with some of the scenes and risks they took! He crafted a very intelligent and creative script, that flowed just right for the 80's, then flowed even better with the 50's, adding consistent tongue and cheek humor.The score by the up and coming, Alan Silvestri, had this magical, yet suspenseful, and even a few sad tones to it. This score was absolutely phenomenal, backed up with a great song by Huey Lewis & the News, That's the Power of Love.Overall, I can go on and on about how great this film is, completely understanding as to why people would call this film flawless. It is absolutely fantastic!!! With only one notable award from the Academy Awards, being Best Sound Editing, this film has a lot to be proud of, and A LOT of nomination worthy aspects. Robert Zemeckis set up the sequel perfectly, and if I was around in the late 80s, I would have definitely went to go support it.","

The rest of the supporting cast is also fantastic. It is very difficult to find something negative to say about this film. It is simply perfection. The music is also on point as it provides a number of iconic and memorable moments. This is a movie that will never get old and always be considered a classic. Films don't get much better than this and it is a joy to watch each and every time. Fantastic all-time great film.","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","2 June 2011","Marty, a young slacker is sent 30 years back in time, and now has to worry about not only returning, but not changing events that have already happened, including that his parents met and fell in love. Whilst this is rather 80's(and granted, that has a charm of its own... it can, however, also be really off-putting), it does stand up well enough, with few jokes and gags having aged poorly. ...is one of those bullies seriously wearing 3-D glasses? The characters tend to be well-done, if there are some really obvious stereotypes(but it seems intentional). Humor works pretty well, if it can be really silly and goofy at times. The dialog is good, some really memorable lines. You always understand the ""science"" aspect, without a lot of wordy explanations, and there is no technobabble. The music is catchy. Acting is great, other than some over the top performances(again, they didn't happen by accident). It's a fun, rewatchable High School comedy flick with time-travel. The climax is also surprisingly tense, for how predictable parts of this can be. I recommend this to any fan of the decade, the cast and the concept itself. 8/10","

"neil-476","7 October 2010","I have seen BTTF loads of time on the small screen but never at the cinema so, lured by the promise of digital remastering, off I went. The ads before the film were pin-sharp and very impressive. BTTF certainly looked good, but I didn't go ""Wow!"" at the image quality.This hardly mattered. Despite its familiarity, BTTF sucked me in at the first frame and didn't release me until the very last. This is one of those films with a delicious concept and fabulous execution. It is not perfect, but it comes close.If I had to come up with criticisms, the minor - very minor! - points I would raise are: 1. ILM's effects, just before the digital age, are still good but could be done better now (the first set of fire strips below Doc and Marty at the Mall, for instance). Likewise the facial prosthetics; 2. Crispin Glover's George McFly is a touch overcooked throughout most of the film. Not until the punch and afterwards does George convince; 3. The episode with Biff berating George in the McFly house in 1985 serves two purposes: it loads up material to be revisited later (when the dialogue repeats in the diner in 1955), but it also illuminates George's and Biff's character, and the relationship between them. The first 20 minutes or so is packed with details like this, and necessarily so, but not all of it is delivered gracefully under the guise of character exposition (the Peabody reference comes to mind, clumsily lobbed into conversation for no particular purpose, just to reference the name on the mailbox later on); 4. Having been stunned into open-mouthed disbelief at encountering younger versions of his father, mother, Biff, and Goldie(!), Marty doesn't register his grandparents with any sense of wonder, and this doesn't ring true (he would have had some sort of reaction whether they were still alive in 1985 or not).I'm nitpicking. This is a great, great film - sheer entertainment from start to finish.","

"Wuchakk","24 March 2017","Released in 1985, ""Back to the Future"" stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a teen who travels back to 1955 to meet his parents when they were teens (Crispin Glover & Lea Thompson). Christopher Lloyd plays the quirky Doc Brown while Thomas F. Wilson plays the villain, Biff. Claudia Wells is on hand as Marty's girlfriend.This is a clever, fun and insightful fantasy that addresses the power of decision at critical turning points in life. It's easily the best of the trilogy, although the second one is almost as good, albeit goofier and more frantic. Everything clicks for a thoroughly entertaining viewing experience.

"The_Void","23 December 2004","Back to the Future is the quintessential eighties movie. It's over the top, kitschy, silly and lots of fun; pretty much what eighties movie making was all about. However, despite being an eighties time capsule; this movie is still well received to this day and will continue to be fun for cinema audiences for generations to come. The reason? Because in spite of being a predominantly fun flick; Back to the Future is a complete piece of cinema. It has it's heart in the right place, it's very funny, it draws themes and parallels from how times have changed, it has interesting characters that you can feel for and it's a lot of fun. Back to the Future is a masterpiece in it's field for all these reasons. We follow Marty McFly; a young slacker who is good friends with a genius inventor, Doc Brown. The fun starts when Dr Brown invents a time machine from a Delorian automobile and after certain events transpire, Marty finds himself in 1955...with his parents as teenagers and without any means to get back to 1985.The idea of going back in time and meeting your parents when they were young is an intriguing one for sure, and this film makes best use of that fascinating (not to mention hilarious) idea, as Marty finds himself the object of his mother's affections. This sort of premise writes itself, and it's so delicious that there's no way it can fail, and fail is anything but what it does. This situation that the movie creates proves itself to be constantly entertaining and the film draws most of it's jokes and parodies from it. The film also details how the things we do can have massive repercussions on our future; but again, it does it with a huge smile on it's face. I'm a big believer that movies don't have to be entirely serious to have a point, and this movie proves that. Also of note is the way that Back to the Future draws parallels between how things were, and how they have changed. It's just little things, like the way Doc Brown confusingly asks if there's a gravity problem in the future after Marty's continual references to events being 'heavy'.Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly and does a great job with it. This actor was born to play this role; he completely looks and acts the part that you would expect this character to be, and for that reason; he is one of the finest casting choices of all time. Just like the Delorian motor company, Fox never got another good gig after this film, which is an ode to how well cast he was. Also like Fox, Christopher Lloyd's role in this film was the making - and the ending - of his career. He is so magnificent and so well fit to the role of the Doc that it's hard to imagine him doing any other type of role. It's a shame for him, but a treat for the audience. Further great castings include Crispin Glover as Marty's dad, George and Lea Thompson, who is all smiles and sweetness as his not bad looking at all, mother.Back to the Future is, if you'll excuse the pun, a timeless classic. It is fit to be enjoyed by people of all ages and generations, and the fact that it's very much an eighties movie never gets in it's way.","

Since then I've been fascinated with the possibilities in time travel (worm hole anyone), Delorean's, Pine Trees, and of cause the 50s culture.What i love about Back To The Future is the whole vibe. Its first Sci Fi/Family/ then Comedy/Action/. It has everything.The story is a gem. Marty (Michael J Fox) is stuck in the year 1955 after escaping from a group of terrorists who were out for revenge after their plutonium had been stolen by Doctor Emmett Brown for his new invention, a time machine. Marty in 1955, is without plutonium and has to figure out how to get back. Fortunately for him, he ""knows"" his history and devises a plan with the doc from 1955 to get back to 1985. Oh, did i mention his parents. That is another story in itself.It doesn't get anymore original than that. The writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale did an incredible job. This is one of few films i can never get tired of watching. If you haven't seen it, then something is seriously wrong with you. Punch yourself in the face for not doing so.10/10.","

"Lejink","1 November 2015","I suppose like many people I got caught up in the whole ""it was 30 years ago today"" shtick surrounding this movie of late and with a free Saturday afternoon indoors, with my wife watched this movie neither of us had seen since 1985. Thankfully, we both found it was just as much fun and exciting to see as all those years ago. I mean I'm an absolute sucker for any kind of time-travel stuff, especially the whole circular time, going-back-to-your-own-past-changing-your-own-future thing. I love how the film sometimes subtly, sometimes obviously sets up the prompts for future resolution, by so often doubling back on itself, but of course never lets all that timey-wimey stuff get in the way of what is at heart a rollicking, exciting, family entertainment.It helps that the casting is so good, Michael J Fox as the spirited, energetic teenager Marty McFly and the great Christopher Lloyd as the madcap scientist Doc Brown in the two lead roles but also the characters of Marty's gormless mum and dad and numb-skull bully Biff. The period-settings are lovingly and nostalgically rendered and the humour is sharp and relevant, as Marty straightens out the future lives of his whole family, actually saves the lives of his brother, sister and Doc while inventing rock and roll in the process!This really is a timeless entertainment and what better adjective could I use to describe it than that.","

"joshuafagan-64214","31 August 2015","This may not be the best movie of the eighties. But it is the movie that I deem to best represent the cinema and spirit of the decade. If you're wondering, that movie for the fifties is Rebel Without a Cause. For the sixties, it's Planet of the Apes. For the seventies, it's Apocalypse Now. For the nineties, it's the Truman Show. For the 2000s, it's The Dark Knight. For the 2010s, it's... I don't know. The Social Network? Anyways; let's dive in to this film, possibly my favorite true action-comedy of all time. If I want to be entertained for two hours, this is the film I'll pop in. There are two kinds of excellence in film; the kind that appeals to what 'normal people' want in movies and the kind that appeals to those who deal probably deal far too much in the esoteric. While I firmly belong in the second group, I am a film-goer, and as such, I do enjoy the first kind. And no film offers more of the first kind than this one.The comedy, the action, the tone, the stylings; they're all here. It does not try to be a big, emotional artsy movie. Instead, it just takes you for an enjoyable ride. The eighties did this kind of movie better than any decade. When you think of eighties movies, you likely think of these movies. This is the best one, but the likes of The Goonies, Ghostbusters, Gremlins, and likely any other movie in this decade with the involvement of Steven Spielberg comes to mind.Not to say that the eighties didn't try to make serious movies too. they just weren't very good at it. If you're interested, look up a list of Best Picture winners. Watching them is a bit weird; they have some eighties stylings but are dead grim and often depressing. It's like watching a film from a different dimension. Some were fine (Terms of Endearment) some were not as good (Out of Africa).I like the lot of them as a whole better than most. And the ones that people really like (Amadeus, Platoon, etc) that people love, I likely love more. But I will admit that they aren't exactly foremost on most people's eyes. There's a reason that there aren't talks to remake Driving Miss Daisy. And it's not because it's artistic blasphemy. They would remake The Godfather if they thought that it would make them money.Here's a novel idea: how about I actually discuss Back to the Future? A high school kid named Marty McFly, down in the dumps from his high school life, where he is bullied by Biff Tannen and is under the control of the aptly named Principal Strickland (strangely, growing up, I had an insurance agent with that last name around by neighborhood. It was weird.) His home life isn't much better: his dad is a wimp, his mom is prudish enough to make one shrivel up, and his siblings are layabouts. But his life changes once his friend Doc Brown makes a time machine (2015 here. still waiting for one). As he stole plutonium form Libyan militants, they chase and kill him. While escaping in a DeLorean, Marty transports them back to 1955.Thus begins the best use of nostalgia for the fifties in an eighties movie I've ever seen. Their cleverness in weaving in it is matched only by what they do with their setting. Where as a lesser movie would just throw up scenery and call it a day, this film uses every opportunity to use its setting for purposes both comedic and dramatic.Whereas films like Dirty Dancing couldn't even immerse their film completely in one decade (if you're gonna be a fifties movie, don't use an eighties soundtrack), this movie somehow manages to immerse you in two decades. Their version of the fifties is solid and fully fleshed out. It does not use pandering or too many rosey tones but still manages to capture the sensation of time traveling there.All this is only likely noticed on a third viewing. The first time, you are too immersed in the perfect blend of action and comedy, a trademark of Zemeckis at his best, from Forrest Gump to Who Framed (not Killed, no matter what my brain thinks) Roger Rabbit, as well as in the tight writing. The second time, you are two invested in the characters and one of the best and catchiest soundtracks of the decade. But if you watch this movie as much as I do, you notice that it is there.What else is there to say? there is a reason that I have such a personal attachment to this film. The only bad thing is that we don't have a time machine that would allow this film to be watched an infinite amount of times without any real time passing. But maybe someday. After all, where we're going, we don't need roads.","

"thesar-2","3 July 2009","What teenage boy didn't want to be Marty McFly (Fox) if they grew up in the 80s? I certainly did. He had it all: someone he loved and loved him back, a best friend that could literally send him on adventures, played guitar in a band, a carefree spirit – using vehicles to accelerate his skateboarding, including a cop's and to be able to time-travel – catching his parents in future lies. I grew up on 'Back to the Future'; I must've watched it 50 times as a kid, never knowing I was taking for granted how much this comedic adventure masterpiece was completely unique and rarely a movie such as this comes around. Watching this now, having watched 1000s of movies since its release 24 years ago, I appreciate it all the more. The movie has great, pitch-perfect lines/comedy, extreme adventure, a heart, still well-made special effects and it certainly reminded me of how great movies used to be made: pre-CGI. Nothing against CGI, a lot of movies today benefit from the effect, but you have to appreciate the 50s town they recreated to scale, making me believe I was there. Marty accidentally gets sent back to 1955 by his best friend (played perfectly by Christopher Lloyd) Doc Brown and after a few scenes to convince him he's really back in time, he seeks the aid of Brown to get, well, ""back to the future."" At the same time, its damage-control with the paradox he creates that almost erases his own existence. Sure, it had minor flaws: Fox definitively didn't look like a teenager in the sequels –he barely pulls it off here and of course there's the typical 80s numerous product placements, down to the DeLorean itself – ironically, not enough to save the doomed car. Still, an absolute must-see.","

"DKosty123","10 January 2006","This film has a pace & magnificence which transcends major holes in the plot/ script. Michael J Fox & Christopher Lloyd are at the top of their careers in this film. They have capable support although the sequels proved that even though Crispin Glover has a good sized supporting role in this film, he really does not add anything by his presence as he is not even missed in the sequels. He did sue producers for the using stock footage of him in the sequels & won the suit, but he'd have been better off to have appeared in the films because he is now much in danger of being referred to as Crispin who? I love the Huey Lewis songs in this first installment. It is nearly impossible to write a time travel film & get it right but you love the main characters & the music so much that you don't care but some obvious ones include Marty McFly paying for coffee in a 1950's Cafe with 1980's money. The license plate coming off the car when they transport Einstein is a great effect but also makes no sense. The changes in the photo of the McFly kids make no sense as why would only the oldest son be effected by problems in the space-time continuum? Humor is a main ingredient of this movie. From classics like how to open a Coke bottle in the 1950's to ""who the hell is John F Kenedy?"" to Pepsi Free, there is humor throughout the film. I like the Fox - Llloyd quotes:""You built a time machine out of a Deloran?"" ""The way I see it, if your going to travel through time you gotta do it with some style!""The people who carry this film are Michael J Fox & Christopher Lloyd who is really over the top. Put your brain away, & get on into the DMC time machine. Enjoy it!","

"cherold","12 December 2011","I haven't seen this movie in 27 years. I decided to watch it again after playing Back to the Future: The Game, which made me nostalgic.As I remembered, it's a funny, entertaining, ingenious movie that never flags. But what I could appreciate now, since even after 27 years I remembered the story remarkably well, was how nicely constructed the movie was. Nothing in it feels like a coincidence, or like a stretch. Everything is put in place. Everything Marty needs is there, but there's a good reason. Every crazy event follows a logical chain of circumstances. The movie is not simply wonderfully filmed but wonderfully designed, an example of a movie where everything has been thought out and nothing fudged. Sure, the story has the sort of time travel conundrums that make all time travel movies susceptible to criticism for being ultimately impossible, but if you accept the basic sci-fi premises, everything else makes perfect sense.If you've never seen it, watch it just for the entertainment. If you've seen it before, watch it again just to notice how nicely put together it is.","

"ElMaruecan82","3 October 2011","With a gentleness delicately lying beneath a smart and intelligent script, contributing to this extraordinary appeal that transcends every age barriers, ""Back to the Future"", in the same vein than its glorious predecessor ""It's a Wonderful Life"", is one of these heart-warming masterpieces that definitely stood the test  of time.There is Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd's improbably pairing as Marty McFly and Doc Emmett Brown, the cool 80's teenager and the mad scientist, yet the chemistry is here, and we believe that these guys can be great friends. There is this unforgettable sight of the De Lorean at 88 mph disintegrating in a flash of light, leaving the two unforgettable fire trails. There is this heart-pounding climax on the clock tower driven by Alan Silvestri exhilarating 80's-defining score. There is this heart in the story. As the pillar of the movie's greatness there is Bob Gale and Zemeckis' winner script.""Back to the Future"" deserves its reputation as one of the most quotable films ever and with the richest gallery of colorful characters each one impacting our memories with so many delirious catchphrases, from Biff Tannen's ""Butthead"" to Marty's ""This is heavy"" and of course, Doc's hysterical ""1,21 Gigawatts!"" or ""Great Scott"". Christopher Lloyd has this unique talent to revive the mad scientist figure with a likable dimension, creating one of the most eccentric and sympathetic characters from the flamboyant 80's. But the power of the script doesn't just rely on its 'destiny' in one-liners, but in the way it rigorously respects the codes of every genre with a new remarkable technical precision.""Back to the Future"" is a masterstroke of originality in the way it adapted the 'adventure' genre, where the exoticness of the setting doesn't rely on its geographical but chronological aspect. Marty lives in a weird world where people don't know what a Pepsi Free or who John Kennedy are, and where Ronald Reagan is still ""the actor?!"". The adventure aspect provides some of the best gags of the film. Now to the Sci-Fi, from the simple premise of the film: time travels, Zemeckis refreshed an old scientific speculation by introducing the notion of ripple effect, that the smallest change in the past can have significant consequences for the future, for the better or for the worse. Finally, a movie had the right approach to time travels, probably earning it a deserving place in AFI's Top 10 Sci-Fi films.This scientific approach conditioned Marty's mission in 1955, by preventing his parents from meeting and falling in love, Marty unknowingly jeopardized his own existence and of his siblings. The script outsmarts us through its ability to convert one thousands words into one simple image, Marty's picture with his brother and sister and the progressive fading of their bodies, cleverly illustrates Doc's notion of ripple effect. No need of words, the picture is the materialization of the success or the failure of the mission. And as long as Lorraine (Lea Thompson), is in love with her future son, the existence of her future children with George is severely compromised.What a tricky dilemma! And when you discover Marty's family in 1985, you wonder how such a loser as George McFly (Crispin Glover) could have had a woman anyways. And Marty made the thing impossible again by replacing his own father on his to-be mother's heart. And Lorraine, by falling in love with her own son, creates a whole oedipal situation that, beyond the laughs, offers a very interesting perspective on the perception we might have toward our parent's youth, as we finally realize that they were young once. Of course, no one would dare to question how he would react if his own mother fell in love with him, but the way this is handled in the film is tactful and never fall into caricature.This is the very aspect that makes ""Back to the Future"" a Family Comedy, with a heart beating for every generation, a film you can enjoy with your parents your buddies or your kids whether it's from the 50's or the 80's nostalgic value. Most of the film's humor relies on the 'generation gap' factor and the way things have changed a lot or not so much. Compare Lorraine's advice to her kids in 1985 and the way she behaved thirty year earlier. See poor Uncle Joey who might get used to his bars as a baby, Biff Tannen's same stupid jokes etc. The film cleverly underlines the effect time can have on our perceptions and relationships with people. But the beauty of ""Back to the Future"" is that the heart of the Family story and the entertainment from the laughs combined with the speculative imagination of Sci-Fi contribute to a new inspirational dimension.Time travels represent the final opportunity to domesticate time, and to get a second chance. George gets a second chance and Marty learns one lesson or two during his journey while applying the fatherly advice he gave to his own father. And even more powerful is the way George would ultimately be the one to win Lorraine's heart and not through Marty's intervention, proving that sometimes, a simple act of bravura can change all your life for the best. Similarly to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", the film is about getting a second chance, about life, about time passing  And I can't go on without mentioning the most extraordinary moment of the film that would eternally ring bells of joy in my heart when George finally kisses Lorraine and in all of sudden, Marty who was progressively fading gets up and sees his brother and sister finally reappear in the photo. Mission accomplished! And two young people dancing, ignoring, but we do, that they'll be forever together. An extraordinary moment that for me, summarizes the cherished place this film will occupy in my heart, for a long ... time.","

"KineticSeoul","28 May 2014","If you wanna watch a very intelligent time travel movie, this one isn't it. However if you wanna see the beginning of a fantastic, adventurous yet well interwoven, grafted and entertaining time travel trilogy this one is the ticket. The thing that makes this movie stand out and endure the test of time is the classic elements that makes a movie such as this memorable with likable characters. And a mission you actually care about as the audience members. Michael J. Fox is just great a Marty McFly who may seem like a typical 80's main teenage character, but there is certain aspects about him that makes him a cool and stands out from the rest. Maybe it's his capability to stand up to bullies even if he is smaller in stature. While also having the courage to follow his dreams and how he conducts himself, despite his flaws of not being able to turn down a challenge. But Christopher Lloyd is the guy that just plain downright nailed it as the wacky scientist Dr. Emmett Brown. Even when it came down to the main villain Biff played by Biff Tannen, who is basically a generic bad guy of this trilogy, but certain elements makes him kind of a stand out villain for me. Maybe because you can see different versions of him, even if he is the bad guy all the way through. Watching this movie was like watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie with a touch of Spielberg's elements, except this trilogy will go down as a classic trilogy. This may seem like a typical 80's movie from the surface, but it has a lot of elements that makes it brilliant. It's difficult to describe in words, but this movie, this trilogy just works and will stick with you. When it comes to the story it's actually very simple, but sometimes the simple aspect of a film makes it more worthwhile sometimes even if it deals with time travel. Watching this even now I can understand why a movie like this can be a timeless classic and give kids a colorful imaginative ideas. I for one tried to build a time machine with my brother when we were younger after watching this movie and had a blast! 9/10","

"Marx_Bros_Fan86","18 July 2008","The majority of 80's comedies have aged very poorly. They are not all necessarily bad, but they have a distinct 80's feel. This is not as much of a problem with Back to the Future, probably because a large part of it does not take place in the 80's! Although it does have more of an 80's feel than its sequels, I think Back to the Future will be enjoyed by audiences for many more years to come. The film has a wonderful blend of comedy, science fiction, and action so that it works on many different levels. Robert Zemeckis and the crew were able to create a perfect 1950's atmosphere, with great sets, 50's music, and 50's television shows.Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) friend Doctor Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) invents a time machine out of a Delorean (a perfect choice for its futuristic look). Marty travels back to the year 1955 and accidentally prevents his father from meeting his mother, endangering his own existence. He must enlist the help of a younger Doc Brown to repair the time machine and get his parents together before he literally disappears! Things go awry when Biff (Thomas Wilson), the bully who controls George McFly's life, interferes with Marty's plans at every turn.The relationships between these characters really elevate this film above its sequels. Lloyd and Fox have terrific chemistry and are always a riot in every scene together. Crispin Glover is hilarious as the nerdy George McFly, and Lea Thompson is a delight as Lorraine Banes, Marty's mother. Marty's scenes with his parents remind us that our parents were once teenagers too. Marty learns that he has more in common with his parents than he thought. He has the same fears as his father and his mother's rebellious spirit. Lorraine develops a crush on Marty that should be disgusting, but Thompson's charm and Fox's awkwardness make it hilarious.I should devote some credit to the film's special effects and action scenes. In order to go forward in time, Marty and Doc have to harness the energy from a bolt of lightning and channel it into the flux capacitor (which makes time travel possible) while driving the Delorean at 88 miles per hour. This sequence remains one of the most exciting scenes I have ever watched, in large part due to Alan Silvestri's score, and I love how they were able to give the clock tower a significant role in every Back to the Future movie. The time machine going back in time is just as impressive today.Back to the Future is my favorite film by Robert Zemeckis, and I doubt he will top it.","

"joshuavogel79","11 January 2011","This is movie magic at its finest.This movie is is fun, funny, captivating, enthralling, suspenseful and all around amazing.Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox are perfect in this movie, and the supporting cast are spectacular as well. Huge shout out to Tom Wilson who plays Biff as well, for being the best movie bully of all time.Now, this film- while being the best thing ever made- ever- is not without its flaws... the opening amp sequence is a bit goofy and out of character with the rest of the film, and Crispen Glover's performance may be too outlandish for some people (personally, I love him in this movie).I'm not sure that this movie is going to stand the test of time- You may have had to live through the 80s to fully appreciate the contrasting attitudes and behaviors of Marty and the people of 1955. I think the film holds up fine right now, but I wonder in 20 years if people will still appreciate its subtleties. In brief, this movie is the most fun thing I've ever watched. Perfect, happy, blissful escapism. Movie magic. Pure movie magic.","

"zkonedog","12 March 2017","When you browse a catalog of films (online or otherwise), the titles are usually arranged according to genre, such as drama, action, comedy, romance, etc. When it comes to Back To The Future, a copy would need to be put in almost every category, as it is perhaps the only film I have ever seen that almost completely defies the very notion of genre. That reason, among others, is why I consider this to be the finest film ever made.The basic story revolves around 1980s teen Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whose friendship with mad scientist ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) ends up with Marty in a time machine--made out of a Delorean!--whisked away to the year 1955, where he ""messes with the space-time continuum"" and must make sure that his parents meet and fall in love once again, thus assuring his own existence.That relatively simple concept contains so, so much more in terms of overall entertainment. It is hilarious, romantic, dramatic, and full of action and adventure in equal measure. The acting is also some of the best that cinema has to offer. While Fox and Lloyd are now iconic as the leads, the trio of Lea Thompson (playing Lorraine Baines), Crispin Glover (George McFly), and Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tannen) almost steal the show on certain occasions with their various personalities. Even the ""bit players"" are superb in their short, yet very important/meaningful appearances.Perhaps the most impressive thing about this entire film experience, though, is the detail put into each and every scene. One must pay close attention to every single detail (no matter how small or seemingly inane) of every single scene in the 1980s-portion of the film in order to better understand the jokes and sight gags of the 1950s-era time frame. I have watched this film at least a dozen or more times all the way through, yet on each viewing I find something new that I seemed to have missed.Finally, the screenplay from ""the Bob's"" (Zemeckis & Gale) is perfect. I say that without hyperbole. There is simply not a wasted line or scene in the entire picture. Everything has meaning in some way, shape, or form that is paid off further down the road.Whenever I watch ""Back To The Future"", its roughly 2-hour runtime seems to absolutely fly by. It is so perfectly paced, with each scene expertly transitioning into the next, that there's never an iota of chance you'll be taken out of the experience in any way. It is the very best that cinema has to offer on all fronts.","

"io_ale_pop98","7 March 2015","I literally made an account just to give a review to this movie and express my appreciation. I have to start by saying that the actors were absolutely amazing. They captured perfectly that revolutionary atmosphere of the 80's. I actually feel what is like to be a teenager in that period just by looking at the way they act. The script and the way it is made OMG i seriously don't know where to begin. All the jokes and punchlines are so carefully implemented, this movie has so many references to both real things like the joke with Ronald Reagan and things from the bttf universe, to give an example it would be the continuous repetitions that are always placed cleverly and even if you get a feeling of what is next you always end up satisfied. What this movie really tries to emphasize is that history repeats itself and that we create our own destiny. The amazing thing about this movie is how Marty travels back in time, a place where we believe we know everything about and we are somehow still mind-blown by every character and action and feeling .You just cannot not get that chill when u think of how irreversible time is and the way this movie captures all these emotions is simply extraordinary. The best movie experience i've ever had!!!","

"hellraiser7","5 August 2018","This is another of one of my favorite films of all time. This film is special to me in so many ways, from the fact that it's another film from my childhood I saw this when I was about seven years old. But most importantly this was the very first time travel sci-fi I've ever seen and it's still my favorite in the sci-fi subgenera. Back then I never even heard of the genre and the concept, this film is one hell of an introductory, it was a concept that blew me away the ability to travel anywhere throughout time; personally, for me I'd love to revisit the 80's decade which is funny to say since this film was made in the 80's. You could also say this was the film that steered me to my favorite TV show of all time ""Doctor Who"".This film just has so much, I really like the story which is fun and clever at the same time. One thing this film does well is the fact things aren't overcomplicated, the fundamental problem with most time travel stories are sometimes they have this stupid need to complicate things or play around too much which really swiss cheeses the story in plot and consistence or that it's overly concerned on the concept and logic but little on story. This film keeps things simple because it keeps the car on the road, by keeping the focus on character and story. Sure, there is a slight complication and inconsistency in this story but it's not noticeable not even concerned about it, even I wasn't and let's face it all time travels stories have this. The film also kind of stays true to the pulp sci-fi as their concern was for story and adventure and logic was shelved.The characters are great from Biff Tannen played well by underrated actor Thomas F Wilson whom is one of my favorite fictional villians as throughout the film series he's had several versions of himself about as many as any Time Lord from ""Doctor Who"". He's a villain you love to hate, yeah, he's basically a bully whom I normally despise but here it's handled right where he's a person you easily can despise but have fun with at the same time. He has some of the best lines, but I think what really makes him stand out is the fact that he's an idiot. Despite the guy being big and strong, having the best car, it's all really just a way to pass himself as cool, the guy literally thinks he's really cool even though in reality everyone around him knows he a dirtbag.But of course, the two characters that really make the film are Marty and Doc Emit Brown played by two of my favorite actors Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd. These two are defiantly one of my favorite duos, both play off each other and balance each other out well.Marty McFly is great he's one of my favorite fictional protagonists because he's someone I can easily emphasize with as I was a kid from the 80's and I can epaphisize with bits of his persona. As he's a teen from the 80's, as he's into skateboarding, music, camcorders, and a lot of things in the 80s, I'm a kid from the 80's I was into that stuff too. He's kind of on the rebellious side, but he's more of a silent rebel as he doesn't always feel a total need to follow every rule, as he sometimes undermines the school principal, even I'm like that sometimes. But what I like about him is he's a person that has big dreams and ambitions, he wants his band to play in big events and also make music in the music world, however he has faced his series of rejections yeah, I can emphasize with that with my acting auditions; however he doesn't give up despite how much it hurts. Though also has dreams of love with his significant other Jennifer played well by Claudia Wells whom I thought was kind of hot, you really get a good feel for her and both of them as they've been a couple for a long time.I really like how Marty reacts to the 1950's decade, since he a kid from the 80's it's easy for me to emphasize with him since I was one to. To some people that either lived or close the decade of the 50's or historians that have some fascination with it, it would be a dream come true to be able to come back to it. But for a person like Marty and myself, we wouldn't really like it not to say it's a place I wouldn't mind visiting but not one I'd want to say in ; for one thing Marty traveled their unintentionally and with time travel machines you'd have the freedom to stroll out the door anytime you want but his freedom has been prohibited so that sucks. However, I really like in the first sequence of going to 1950's Hill Valley how disoriented and even scared he looks, I'm sure that would be how we would react to walking to a decade long gone it's like walking into another world. From seeing vintage cars, you would see in a car museum being driven conveniently, old songs you'd hear on an oldies but goodies on a sat radio station being played as if they've just made the billboard, certain things that aren't around yet like video games or further seasons of ""Doctor Who"", it wouldn't exactly be like going to a vacation spot.It's also funny in the film how Marty in an inadvertent way affects things not just from how he brings his parents together but also how may 'be he was one factor that may have helped get certain things in our modern-day culture started. Like the music he plays in the school dance, the skateboard, you name it. To me that's part of the what makes the film it funny and fascinating, it really shows how one person can really have a big affect on time without know it but also how one person truly can make a difference. Though it also brings up the parallel dynamic between both Marty and the 50's decade as both were a time of great changes from youth to culture.Doc Brown is just great as he's is a genius but is a bit childlike as he does have a bit of an eccentricity from his hairstyle which always seems to be stick up to even how rapidly inventive he is. However, he does have a good dose of common sense and wisdom which keeps him from not flying off the road but also able to interact properly and mentor Marty. But one thing about him I can easily emphasize with is on how fast he is, he the kind of person that loves to do lots of things and get things done but is aware he has limited time to do them. Like in one scene, he has built a rather elaborate scale model of the town but is apologetic that he didn't have enough time to paint and give it details, despite the fact it's looks great all the same. I just find that a little funny because I'm sort of like that myself where sometimes I get one thing done but there is one other thing I haven't got done yet or I wanted to do within the given time.I really love the DeLorean, it's my second favorite time traveling machine next to the Tardis on ""Doctor Who"" which you know is my first. Making a time traveling machine out of a car was unheard of at the time, personal I thought it was a cool idea and really is a lot more convient because with it you will not just travel back or forwards in time, but you'd be able to drive within that time period where ever you need to go and hide it better by driving to a spot. The effects on that DeLorean are cool just every time it travels in time it just leaves a vapor trail of fire on the road. Music is also great this film has probably one of the best soundtracks I know. From the theme song from Alvin Silvestri which perfectly reflects the movie as it has an adventurous tone. Another trademark are two other songs from the film ""The Power of Love"" and ""Back in Time"" by Huey Lewis and the News. As well as a few familiar oldies but goodies tracks, most notably the song ""Johnny Be Good"" at the dance.There are lots of fun moments I won't say them all since there are so many which makes the better because there's not one dull moment, from the big highlight for me is the Skateboard sequence which is one of my favorite chase scenes, here it's a skateboard skating away from an automobile. When you think about it being on a skateboard does have its advantages as Marty is able to ride on sidewalks and certain roadways and areas that an automobile would have a hard time accessing, which means plenty of opportunities to outmaneuver his opponent. But also, the fact that Marty is using a skateboard in the 1950's decade alone is really cool, since they didn't have skateboards back then. To even the small moments my favorite which is to me one of the best reference jokes ever when Marty puts himself in the Rad suit and is tricking George to asking Lorene out by mixing up two popular sci-fi franchises, that segment always cracks me up being a sci-fi fan.Well I've said enough, ""Back to the Future"" is a timeless classic that has the millage that goes beyond time.Rating: 4 stars","

"davidmvining","16 November 2020","This movie is just plain fun, and it manages that because of how Zemeckis approaches a plot heavy film. It's been obvious from the beginning of his career with I Wanna Hold Your Hand that the two Bobs (Zemeckis and Gale) loved to put characters with clearly defined characteristics through a puzzle of a plot with clearly defined goals to pull them through. The likeable characters are the grease that keeps the plot running smoothly, providing a key to the film's success. When the two Bobs were in film school, they were surrounded by others who loved the French New Wave, and they just wanted to make Hollywood films of fun. With Back to the Future, they succeeded just so completely.The interesting thing about Marty McFly is that he doesn't have an arc in this film. At all. He doesn't grow. He learns a bit about his parents but the knowledge doesn't change him. At the end of the film, he's exactly the same person as he was in the beginning. This seems to fly in the face of everything screenwriters usually want to put into a movie, but it works really well because of the kind of adventure Marty gets sent on. He is presented with a problem (being sent back in time to 1955 from 1985), and he needs to solve it. In order to get there he is presented with a series of obstacles that he must overcome, including his mucking up of his own parents' uninspiring and flawed relationship. That's where we get character growth, in secondary characters that have a direct relationship to Marty himself and his journey back.So, Marty and his older crazy scientist friend, Doc Brown, get attacked by Libyans at Doc's first successful test of his time machine made out of a DeLorean. The choice to make the time machine out of a futuristic looking car is a great one on the part of the movie. It allows for the time travel dynamic with exciting visceral thrill at the same time. It also allows for an exciting climax, of course. Doc gets killed and Marty barely gets away, accidentally getting sent back in time without any extra fuel (some plutonium), and needing to find a way home to 1985. Before he ever gets to managing the beginning of a plan, he ends up bumping into both of his parents as he explores this new, brighter, cheerier nightmare world that he must escape.The mix of his exploration of the new world and his discovery of his parents as young people is expertly intertwined so that we never feel like we're coasting without momentum. His break of the history that brought his parents together is handled quickly, allowing Marty personal stake in getting involved in his parents' relationship at the very beginning. The 1955 Doc Brown encourages this because of vague concerns about the end of the universe and some concern for Marty himself who's due to disappear if things don't get set right. The stakes are clear and make sense to Marty's character. It allows the audience to happily go along with Marty on this journey through time. It doesn't matter that he doesn't change. It matters that the audience likes him and roots for him as he faces obstacle after obstacle on his clearly defined journey that just happens to be fun at the same time.The clear line of action ends up forming and Marty has to balance preparing for the historical lightning strike that he and Doc will use to send him back to the future while, at the same time, trying to repair the relationship he tore apart before it formed. The normal expectation of character change happens around Marty's father, George, who can no longer just fall into a romantic relationship with the pretty Loraine, but he must earn her affection. That earning, at the ironic guidance of his own far more confident son, turns George into a better, more confident man.The puzzle-like nature of the plot, reminiscent of and superior to what Zemeckis and Gale pulled off in their earlier pictures, all falls into place marvelously through the movie's climax. The clock tower, established in the opening minutes, the bad starter on the DeLorean, the tree falling on the cable, the visual call back to both the famous image of Harold Lloyd from Safety Last! and a clock at the beginning of the film, and more all come together in perfect harmony to give us the cathartic release as we watch Marty and Doc overcome all of the challenges to complete their goal.The film has all of the hallmarks of a Zemeckis and Gale production at their most enjoyable. The long opening shot that introduces Doc's workshop is evocative of Hitchcock's opening shot of Rear Window, revealing key pieces of character and plot information elegantly. It's paced quickly, never slogging down in unnecessary details, always successfully pushing the story forward. It's energetic, fun, and expertly crafted. This is Zemeckis and Gale have a ball and inviting the audience along for the fun.","

"TheMovieDiorama","15 June 2019","Great Scott! Finally managed to watch the quintessential 80s flick that combines a plethora of genres to generate an astounding 1.21 gigawatts. Enough to make me want to go back in time and watch it again. Damn. Damn damn! Now, it's no surprise that Zemeckis' most accessible film is the one that has stood the test of time. Spielberg matching him with this project was seemingly fate, and in the process they had created a pop culture phenomenon that contributed massively to many childhoods. A teenager, who documents a time travelling experiment with an eccentric scientist, accidentally travels back in time to which he must repair history and return to the correct year.With Zemeckis' overwhelming contribution and Gale's stellar writing, they had amalgamated an absurd amount of genres into one adventure. Primarily a romantic comedy with the aesthetics of a science-fiction adventure packed with arresting action set pieces. A whimsical invention that perfectly balanced a variety of tones, resulting in an instant classic. Embedding various intricacies within its script, from the clock tower donation fund to the flux capacitor revelation, that you subconsciously start to cling onto every line of dialogue. Every word is so important in its foreshadowing, that it progressively enhances the enjoyment of its story.It has to be said that the execution of some of these moments were heavy-handed (in case we missed anything...) and the paradoxical nature of its time travel premise was frequently brushed over. But the purposefully engaging characters and plot are able to distract us from these loopholes that sci-fi features commonly fall into. Although the final ten minutes wrapped up far too neatly for my taste, considering Doc went against his own words of advice.Speaking of good ol' Doc Brown, Lloyd's performance was the highlight for me. Capturing the eccentric personality of his character perfectly, from the exaggerated facial expressions to the excitable scientific mumbo-jumbo that he blurts out. He is just as memorable as the pimped out DeLorean. Fox, again, was perfect casting for Marty McFly, the flyest kid in town with his hardcore skateboarding skills hanging onto the back of vehicles. Comedic timing was exquisite and the more dramatic moments involving his past younger mother and father were well handled by him. Glover deserves some praise also, no longer will I class him as the ""creepy thin man"" from 'Charlie's Angels'. He is George McFly, author extraordinaire and my new personal hero for decimating Biff with one punch. Now, Biff for me was too one-dimensional to have a lasting impression, and became a forced plot device just so that the film had an antagonist of some sort. Personally, it didn't need one. Exclude him, or grant him some development time, and the story would've benefited from those alterations.It must be said that Silvestri's grand score accompanied the joyous onscreen shenanigans stupendously, and certainly had that Spielberg flair found in most Amblin productions despite the small scale drama. Oh, and ""The Power of Love"" is banging. All this time, and I didn't know it was associated with this film (I'm so uncultured...)!Suffice to say, regardless of the shortcomings and an absence of personal childhood nostalgia for the film, it still delivers strong entertainment today. Perfect casting, punctual dialogue and memorable scenes. It may not be the best 80s film I've seen, but it certainly has the gigawatts the maintain its lasting power for many years to come.","

"mohammedalawami-10948","4 February 2021","Everyone has already talked about how amazing and fun this movie is and I'm going to join in. I went in this movie with very high expectations with everyone saying how amazing it was and somehow this movie exceeded my expectations. This movie is just perfect!Michael J Fox and all the other actors are incredible in this movie. Fox has such a natural dynamic with Christopher Lloyd. Their friendship seems too real at times. Lea Thompson really delivers this performance of a thirsty teenage girl, Thimas Wilson perfectly sells this hateful bully so it was so satisfying seeing Bill taken down but Cristin Glover sells the film and his performance is a huge reason into why George has an amazing character arc.And now let's talk about the script because this movie truly has one of the best and most exciting scripts and stories. Everything is set up so perfectly in the beginning with the character's backgrounds, personalities as well as the locations and important informatiom all being established so well for the 1955 section. Not a single scene is wasted. Every scene plays a role in the overall story and everything is linked together and this plot of Marty trying to get his 1955 version mom and dad to fall in love is a perfect concept given everything set up leading to a very exciting climax and a great character journey for George McFly.Speaking of the climax, it's probably the best part of the movie. Mainly because the movie does a great job by increasing tensions and leaving you wondering if Marty will even return back to 1985. I mean, the plan should have been a breeze but so many things went wrong and you're alwaus glued to the screen as you aren't sure what's going to happen and this leads to an emotionally satisfying climax where George and Lorainne finally kiss and that 80s music makes it 10 times better and a heart-racing climax where it seems as though Doc will fail to bring Marty to 1985 but he does and the ending is perfect, seeing Marty's family all so happy.This film is just so awesome and gets better everyime I rewatch it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, stop what you're doing immediately, turn on Netflix and watch the movie. You'll not be disappointed. A must-see for everyone!","

"freemantle_uk","5 September 2009","Back to the Future is a film that for people of my generation would have growth up with, along with other important films like the original Indiana Jones films, Stars Wars trilogy, the first two Alien films, the Rocky Series and Mad Max 1 and 2 (just to name a few). Here is a fun family film that has stood the test of time.Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), is a 17-year-old teenager living in Hill Valley, California. He has a loving family, a good girlfriend and helps a mad scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd). But he lives in a geeky family, his dad George (Crispin Glover) is bullied by his supervisor and avoids confrontation, his mum Lorraine (Lea Thompson) has conservative values and doesn't like Marty's relationship with Jennifer (Claudia Wells), and Marty's brother and sister are generally geeky. One Dr. Brown, aka 'Doc', asks for Marty's assistance and records the experiments with his next invention, a time machine (in the design of a DeLorean DMC-12). The test seems successful until Libyan terrorists kill 'Doc' and whilst on the run Marty ends up travelling back in to 1955. Whilst in 1955 Marty meets both his mum and dad as teenagers, and interferes with how they met. By doing this he messes up the time-space continuum and risks his own existences. The younger version of Lorraine falls for Marty, not know he is her future son; adding both to comedy and general creepiness. It's a race against time, both to get back to 1985 and to insure destiny is fulfilled by his setting up his parents.Back to the Future is a family sci-fi comedy which is a symbol of its time. It works as a fish out of water comedy, teen comedy and a general look at time travel. They is a simple plot and theme about Marty finding out who his parents are and looks at the similarities and differences of live in the 50s and 80s. The aim of the filmmakers was to make a fun film, and Robert Zemeckis does this. He is a protégé of Steven Spielberg and he keeps the story simple and entertaining. He also shows his skills as a special effects director which in this film were very good. The special effects help the story, but don't overshadow it. They is a very good script to this film, mixing drama and comedy, and hasn't dated badly. The film is humorous and light-hearted. The humour is not crude, like it it in some family films. There is a strong story and with good messages for kids about standing up to bullies and respecting your parents. Michael J. Fox was perfectly casted for the lead role and there are many excellent supporting cast members. Lea Thompson was perfectly pretty as Lorraine and Crispin Glover was fine as a needy kid. Christopher Lloyd and Thomas F. Wilson were really excellent as the mentor and the villain.Back to the Future is an influential family film. It is a mark of pop-culture with this movie being parodied in Family Guy and Futurama. It is Robert Zemeckis' best film (though Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a close second).","

"youkevo","9 August 2020","I first saw this movie way back in 1985 when it came out on VHS video. I rented it out from one of my local video rental shops and absolutely loved it. I watched it twice that night and again the following morning before I had to bring it back.
This movie is a great family sci/fi comedy that captures the imagination. At some point in our lives we've all wished we could travel through time - I know I have.
This movie has great adventure, thrills and laughs that should not be missed, nor should the sequels. A terrific all-round joyride that you'll enjoy time and time again.
In recent times I bought the trilogy on DVD, so as to enjoy the movies whenever I want, and trust me, I do.
I fully recommend this movie and the sequels. Both Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are perfectly cast as the time travelling duo. So, what are you waiting for?","

This movie is so beloved that I can't imagine anyone is coming to a review site to read what people think to get help deciding if they should see it or not. It's full of great characters, unique situations, and fun moments. It's packed with action and humor. Marty and the Professor are iconic roles performed wonderfully by the lead actors. Almost forty years later and BTTF is still a household name and part of our shared film culture. You see a Delorean, you think of this movie. It is endlessly satisfying to watch, and my only criticism is that there are one or two sequences that are drawn out for suspense that aren't really necessary. But that is just one guy's nitpick. Most people will find this to be a near-perfect viewing experience.","

"bellino-angelo2014","16 December 2021","I must have seen this movie at least 5, 6 times through all my life even tho I have never reviewed it. Why I am doing it now then? Well, a while ago I saw an episode of THE MOVIES THAT MADE US where they discussed the fact that Eric Stoltz (who went on to be Rocky Dennis in MASK) was the original Marty McFly but he was fired because he thought that the movie was a drama and not a comedy as Robert Zemeckis intended it. And despite today there are only a few glimpses of Stoltz's original footage, the version we all know is just great.As there are already more than 1,350 reviews for this movie already I'll be brief. High school student Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) goes back in time to 1955 with the invention of a time machine created by his eccentric friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Marty meets his parents when they were not married yet and for adjusting things in the future he makes them meet again in a wiser way so that in 1985 there will be positive changes.The acting is good. Michael J. Fox was born for the role of Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd is great in one of his most memorable roles along that of Judge Doom of WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT. The soundtrack is among the best for a movie of this genre and gives also lots of nostalgic vibes. And the script is very funny and witty.Overall, one of those family movies that stands the test of time and manages to be safe for younger folks. A rare quality in today's family movies.","

"The_Movie_Cat","27 August 2000","I always regard the eighties as the weakest decade for movies. Short running times were filled out with one dimensional characters and thin plots, patronising audiences with their banality. Some thought John Hughes was a genius, and everyone liked Arnold Schwarzenegger. Thankfully, there were the occasional gems in the mire, and Back to the Future – a family film with daring themes of incest and attempted rape – is one of them.Michael J.Fox is excellent as Marty, though you can't help thinking someone as boyish and short could never really be so cool. And I always thought it was irresponsible for a film to show such potentially fatal activities as skateboarding on the back of vehicles. Then again, how sensible can you be when your main songs are by Huey Lewis and the News?Still, eighties haircuts and braces as fashion statements not withstanding, this film holds up remarkably well. The heavily signposted coincidences and plot developments are fun, while the support work well, particularly Crispin Glover as Marty's dad. A number of ""blink and you'll miss it"" pieces add to the enjoyment, especially an advert on the back of a newspaper Marty picks up – which can only be seen clearly via freeze-frame – proclaiming: ""You'll be noticed driving the car of the future"".Direction could occasionally afford to be a little more cinematic in its approach (note how Marty films the Doc's experiment on a camcorder but we never see the camera's perspective; possibly because it's an obviously fake camera with no recording light) but generally it's sound. Christopher Lloyd's overacting could also grow irritating for some. Evidence of mild product placement does not really hinder the piece, and the evocation of 50's Middle America is quite charming.Maybe there's the nagging feeling that – now fifteen years old – the film's cultural parodies seem hopelessly naive in their application. Constant references to Star Wars, Ronald Reagan and Jackie Gleason don't seem as fresh or relevant as they once did. Back to the Future is an okay film, and an amusing diversion. But its lack of realistic characterisation and mainstream trappings make it an entertaining pile of fluff, nothing more.","

I think the very concept is intriguing and awe-inspiring. And Back to the Future parts 1 and 2 are my favourite time travel films. In fact, they're some of my favourite films ever, period. BTTF does an incredible job at explaining how time travel works without making it overly complicated. It is just so much fun and super rewatchable - I could watch both movies over and over again and never get bored. The music is amazing too, and I'd say this movie has one of the most memorable film scores of all time.","

"LW-08854","23 December 2023","A insanely enjoyable 1980s movie presented on a great blu ray transfer which features some with lovely strong colours and perfect sound quality.This film is packed full of nostalgia, it's playful and funny yet also surprisingly sweet & creative, it also features some really fun special effects and a great score coupled with splashes of humour throughout the piece.The premise is Marty has been sent back in time, and must then fix it for his Mother and Father to fall in love after he inadvertently messes up the moment when they were meant to first meet. The film was superbly directed and has energy , life and colour in each and every scene. The 1950s that Marty returns to is a bright and colourful environment. The use of colour is well thought through Marty wears bright colours, blue jeans, an orange jacket to reflect his happy easy going personality. Generally bad things tend to happen at night such as Loraine being attacked or Doc being shot.All the characters are really over the top and it works, we have the High School Bully, the mad scientist, the girl next door type, the nerdy wimp, the stern teacher. I actually found Biff a little disturbing, he actually seems quite dangerous to both the boys and girls he picks on, in several scenes characters he goes after barely get away.The first 10 minutes suggest the opening of a high-school themed movie about a boy who wants to play guitar and his dysfunctional family, it quickly switches to more of a Sci-fi element , then into action, and then to comedy and then into the realms of romance. It's these swings and changes which constantly keep you on your toes and enjoying the film, each new part brings fresh energy and pace to the story.The film is just incredibly funny and sweet and clever. The 1950s setting is extremely fun and the interactions between Marty and his younger dad just make the movie.","

"Movie-ManDan","8 December 2017","'Back To The Future' can't be unloved by people. It was loved back when it came out in 1985 and its success has only grown. It has become a pop culture phenomenon worthy of all the success and praise it gets.Christopher Lloyd just finished 'Taxi' and was doing a slew of successful films. Eric Stoltz was making a name for himself. But at the last minute, Stoltz was fired and 'Family Ties' own Michael J. Fox was replaced as protagonist alongside Christopher Lloyd. This co-stars some other up-and- comers that would go on to become household names.Fox stars as Marty McFly. He's a high school senior who loves his girlfriend, tries to get gigs with his band, must deal with a mean principal and a weird family. He is also an errand boy for the wacky scientist Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd), who Marty calls ""Doc."" Doc is constantly coming up with odd inventions and nobody can take him seriously, but he does sustain Marty's interest. His latest invention is a time machine made out of a DeLorean. Since that car has been discontinued, everybody's immediate association with it is a time machine. Doc calls Marty to test it at 1am so they can be in complete privacy. But they are soon found by terrorists who Doc fraudulently squeezed plutonium away from. Marty narrowly escapes...The first act is getting to know Marty and his family and Doc. The subplot with the terrorists is also important. Marty escapes by accidentally entering 1955 on the date Doc got the envision for the time machine. Marty bumps into some people from his own present and tells them their fate. But it is his parents that he encounters that will mess up the timeline forever. His mom is a player who developed the hots for Marty instead of his dad. Marty completely screwed up the day they met. His dad is a total wimp too scared to ask his mother out or stand up to bully Biff Tannen. Marty is a hip daredevil who is the key in changing his father for the better and tricking him. This story with Marty trying to reconnect his parents is hilarious. Its my favourite aspect oft he film. Then there's Biff Tannen, who is the best bully in film history. I'm not condoning bullying, but Biff is hilarious. How can Marty return to 1985? His escape was too abrupt to retrieve any plutonium for his way back, so he's stuck. Or is he? Doc says a bolt of lightning is the only thing of equivalent charge to plutonium. Hill Valley's (the film's setting) historic clock towers struck by lightning and it hasn't rung since. Next week will be the day it happens, so Doc and Marty construct a plan for the charge to hit the DeLorean and send Marty back to the future. Funny how these three very important events (Marty's parents meeting, Doc coming up with the idea for the time machine, and the clock tower destruction) take place over the course of the same week.As a time travel film, there are lots of holes and plot errors that cannot be unseen. The wonderment is what makes films like this so groundbreaking. But at least there's enough smarts around this. As I mentioned earlier, Marty dealing with a week in the 50s with his parents is my favourite aspect. The whole ""fish out of water"" bit is done so well and so funny. It culminates with Marty doing an edgy rendition of Chuck Berry's ""Johnnie B. Goode"" which is my favourite scene in all of cinema. His imitations of various guitar legends such as Eddie Van Halen and Pete Townsend make it even more funny than it is. This movie makes me feel so wonderful each and overtime I see it (which is a lot). it is spiritually uplifting with heart and comedy to make it fun, and complexity to take it seriously.It should always remain the best movie ever made about time travel. 10/10","

"PredragReviews","22 April 2016","Back to the future"" is a lesson in movie-making. The script is really good, the director (Zemeckis) does what is expected of him, and the cast is perfect for the characters.The story itself is hardly original, but how it is told is outstanding. Not only that this film is funny, it succeeds in creating a certain atmosphere that is hard to describe. An atmosphere that you can feel and which distinguishes good movies from classics. You really connect with all the characters on screen. Zemeckis' first & only choice was Michael J. Fox for the role of Marty. Marty McFly is the part Fox was born to play, but there are other great performances here, as well. Christopher Lloyd is excellent as ""Doc"" Brown, and Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas Wilson also help to make this a very entertaining movie. There is an extra attraction here for those of us who can remember the 1950's, and some of the gags based on Fox's out-of-time character are classic. Also, this movie is recognizable by his amazing soundtrack composed by Alan Silvestri, including ""Power of Love,"" by Huey Lewis and the News. The track was a billboard charter at the time of the film, and it's rhythm and beat are still catchy. Overall, it's a good sci-fi film with the right amount of tension and laughs, and even some really touching moments.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.","

"BobbyT24","3 August 2015","I've watched this movie so many times, I can quote the entire movie. I'm not giving anything away by saying it was/is still ahead of it's time. Although the characters' belief that 2015 would be significantly different than our current 2015 actually IS, is irrelevant (actually, it's a comedy so the guesses at reality just makes it funnier!). Robert Zemeckis directed a legendary movie mocked and satirized in many movies afterward. That's the highest praise a picture can garner. This is as near-to-perfection as screen comedy/time travel gets in my book.To put the writing/directing in perspective, I will tell you what my screen writing teacher said about this movie a few years ago when she screened just the opening sequence for our class... She said the opening sequence of nearly five minutes long with few editing breaks sets the stage for what is to come. She said this was how professional screenwriters dream about opening a movie. It's just... flawless. The opening reveals layer upon layer of story themes with very few words, just visuals and a few key noises in the background. Without a single actor in the midst. It's just the setting and a moving camera. We have just been treated to circa-1985 without ever even seeing an actor walking across screen. THEN the actor walks in. It only gets better from there. Magnificence in direction.Watching it again last night made me realize how special of a movie it really was. I simply enjoyed the experience. It transported me back to 1985 all over again. Knowing everything there is to know about the story. And it STILL makes me laugh. The fact they set it in 1985 was a stroke of genius. People in 2015 can only joke about what they believed the future would look like. But the writers/director so very wisely chose to say ""1985"" and not ""Present Day"" -- a date-reference killer once a movie reaches an age where current present day looks nothing like the movie we're watching. That 1985 date also allows for a perfect anchor to bounce around in the future two sequels in the series.I remember watching this in the theater when it was first run in - yes, I was there - 1985. My best friend sitting next to me in the theater watched Michael J Fox stumble along 1955 Main Street and his comment at that moment in the movie was, ""Nobody could play this character better than Michael J Fox."" I have to agree. MJF IS Marty McFly personified. He carries the picture effortlessly and heroically, along with the hilarious and severely underrated Christopher Lloyd as the genius/basket case, Dr. Emmitt Brown. Two genius actors playing off one another, along with the perfect supporting cast, makes this a must-watch movie at any time in history. It is genuinely funny, sweet, nostalgic, witty, beautiful, and exciting. Every scene has something to do with another scene. There is literally not a single wasted frame in this movie. Later episodes of the series aren't as perfect as BTTF1 but that's a different story... If anyone ever creates a time-capsule, PLEASE make sure to include this movie. Future millennia of species will enjoy it too. :-)If you haven't watched ""Back to the Future"" before, regardless of your age or generation, please reward yourself with this near-perfect time-travel comedy. I loved it even more this time around. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. 10 out of 10.","

"bkrauser-81-311064","23 January 2014","Lou: You going to order something, kid? Marty: Ah, yeah. Give me a Tab. Lou: I can't give you a tab unless you order something. Marty: Right. Give me a Pepsi Free. Lou: You want a Pepsi pal, you're gonna pay for it. Within that one single exchange between Back to the Future's (1985) protagonist Marty (Michael J. Fox) and the neighborhood soda jerk there are so many things going on. Marty has traveled back thirty years into the past and is slowly coming to terms/panicking about where he is and how he got there. Studebakers and old Mustangs drive by the window, the future mayor of Hill Valley (played by Donald Fullilove) mops behind him and a younger version of his father (Crispin Glover) sits right next to him. Yet all the audience is supposed to pick up is that the lingo in Hill Valley circa 1955 is completely different than what he's used to which leads to this hilarious exchange.While Pepsi Free no longer exists and Tab iswell Tab, the fact still remains that Back to the Future remains the epitome of a timeless classic. It's a classic based on its plot: a teenager who has befriended an oddball scientist (Christopher Lloyd) goes back into the past with his time machine and has to get back. It's a classic based on its sub-plot: said teenager messes up his mother and father's first meet and has to make the two fall in love before he's never born. It's a classic because of its state-of-the-art special effects which really haven't aged all that much and it's confident direction led by Robert Zemeckis. Finally it's a classic because of its humor and heart. How many times have you seen time travel in a movie and ask yourself honestly, whose done it any better?Back to the Future made full fledged movie stars out of its likable leading man Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Lloyd's Doc Brown is an unforgettable character that is permanently etched in this writers head. He's the gold standard of mad scientist that all future lab-coated eccentrics have to reach before I can deem them worthy. Fox's lovable Marty is smart, creative and surprisingly full of energy. Up until that point Fox had a regular gig on Family Ties (1982-1989) and had to work both projects averaging five hours of sleep for three months to finish the picture; it's a wonder he doesn't look like a wax statue.It is said that Robert Zemeckis had tried for months to get a meeting with Steven Spielberg before finally bursting into his office unannounced and showing him his USC student film. Spielberg (German for childhood hero) would go on to executive produce his first few movies including the solidly acted box-office failure Used Cars (1980). Around that time, Spielberg also produced films by Joe Dante, Chris Columbus and Kevin Reynolds, but it was Robert Zemeckis who left the biggest mark on cinematic entertainment. It was his attention to detail and early adoption of computer generated special effects in Back to the Future that established Zemeckis as a technical wunderkind. Zemeckis would follow the success of Back to the Future with the equally inspired Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and has since become a producer/director himself.Yet Back to the Future remains a timeless package of an auteur at his zenith. A tight, clean story told with energy and panache. It has no equal and will likely never be pushed off its perch as the king of unfettered quality entertainment. In the realm of childlike wonder, Spielberg may be king but his best film is arguably not one he has directed himself but one he produced. And that production is 1.21 gigawatts of awesome.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/","

"rmax304823","20 May 2008","Good-natured and enjoyable fantasy about Michael J. Fox (as Marty McFly) who travels 30 years into the past with the help of Dr. Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and his magic, plutonium-powered DeLorean.The present -- that is, 1985 -- is a bit of a mess in Fox's small town. What's left of the downtown area is surrounded by strip malls. The two movie theaters are defunct. One has been converted into an evangelical church and the other shows X-rated movies. Homeless bums sleep on the benches of the town square. Fox's mother (Lea Thompson) is an overweight, hopeless alcoholic; his father is a witless nobody constantly abused by a burly friend who exploits him and then insults him for his imperfect efforts.Lloyd is a maniacal scientist who steals plutonium from Lebanese terrorists to fuel his traveling time machine. He's shot by them as Fox barely escapes, zooming into the past.It's 1955 now and we note that the state of the town is rather better in most respects. No garbage on the streets. No suburbs, but farmland ""as far as the eye can see."" A couple of good gags follow, right out of ""The Twilight Zone."" Pull into a gas station and half a dozen employees rush out to service your car. A cup of coffee is five cents. When Fox orders a Tab in the diner, the counter man doesn't know what he's talking about. A ""Pepsi free"" doesn't help.But there are of course the kind of complications that usually follow from time travel. Fox meets his own mother and father, as well as Dr. Brown. The problem is that Fox's mother gets the hots for him and Fox must arrange for his own father to take his place in her affection. In brief, he does so, successfully travels back to 1985, and finds Dr. Brown has paid attention to a warning and worn a bullet-proof vest so he survives the terrorist shooting.I enjoy seeing it once in a while and I gather it was immensely popular. There's just enough profanity to pep things up and keep this from being a movie for children. The plot itself isn't challenging in any way, though some of the gags require a certain maturity to be understood. Someone asks who is president in 1985. ""Ronald Regan? The actor? Who's vice president -- Jerry Lewis?"" Fox is a convincing high-schooler and easy to identify with. Christopher Lloyd is overly manic and with his bulging eyes resembles a creature out of the very depths of the ocean. Lea Thompson doesn't add much, but Chrispin Glover as Fox's father seems all flapping arms and legs.I think it might have been more enjoyable if the anachronisms had been spread throughout the movie instead of being all crowded into the first ten minutes or so of the 1955 period. Some of the comedy was thrown away in the interests of special-effects and pseudo-drama. (Think of ""Groundhog Day,"" in which all the elements are seamlessly blended.) And it also appears that McFly adapts too readily to 1955. After the first few minutes, nothing surprises him. He takes this extraordinary experience for granted and simply goes about the business of bringing his parents together and figuring out a way to get back to his real ""present"" before his picture disappears from the snapshot he's brought along with him. (?) I'd have been taking notes every minute. A few liberties are also taken with the norms of 1955. Good girls, like Lea Thompson, didn't reach under the table to squeeze a stranger's thigh. At least none of them did that with me. And if theywouldn't have done it with me, they obviously wouldn't have done it to anyone. Except -- and this is probably the answer -- Lea Thompson was a slut to begin with. Yes, that must be it. How disgusting.Anyway, you'll have fun watching the film. The kids will too. It generated three sequels, none of which I've watched.","

"moviewizguy","27 December 2007","The year is 1985 and Marty McFly is your everyday teenager, except for one problem. He is stuck in 1955. After his good friend Doc Emmett Brown is gunned down, Marty ends up sending the DeLorean back twenty years into the past. Now, he must find the Doc and convince him that he is from the future, in order for the Doc to send him back to the future, but this is the least of Marty's problem. After accidentally getting in the way of the important meeting between his future mother and father, Marty must get them back together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own existence.This may not be one of the most complex time travel movie, but it is sure a lot of fun! I love time travel movies. Everything you've seen from an average time travel movie is seen here: Person goes to the past and if he changes anything, the future will change; but only this time, there are some problems with having a mother loving her son (actually falling in love with each other).Now this is one weird and wacky time travel movie. There are things that have been done in other time travel movies before (even theories made up by one of the characters) but there are also new and maybe not as original (as I hoped) things in here to enjoy and mess your mind around. But the main thing is try to not over complicate what is going on. Just have fun.","

"Howlin Wolf","15 March 2001","One of the most genuinely enjoyable movies for enjoyment's sake.  I just cannot conceive how they could have made this a better movie.   It seems like Fox was born to play McFly, and try as he might, he can never get away from the part now.  Although he's done good work elsewhere, this is the one he'll be remembered for.  His defining role.   As someone else mentioned, Lloyd overacts, but somehow I never mind.  Lea Thompson has an indefinable quality, so I won't even try.  Crispin Glover is just wonderfully weird as George McFly.  No one could have played the role like him, and I think perhaps the reason the sequels suffer a bit in comparison to this one is his absence (tighter scripting would also have helped...)  Still, don't wanna give the guy a big head, 'cos when all's said and done he aint the star of the show...   What's also impressive about this is the attention to detail.  It would have been so easy to turn out a pale imitation of what we actually got with this premise, but thankfully the film-makers didn't.  Every little in-joke and movie reference adds to the created universe and involves us more with the characters.  Thanks guys, you can tell you had a lot of fun with this movie.   Also, there is no better director than Robert Zemeckis for creating escapist cinema.  This is a bona fide classic and will be no matter how far into the future you travel...","

"hnt_dnl","23 March 2008","BACK TO THE FUTURE is the rarest of movies. It has every element imaginable in it and going for it: science fiction, fantasy, humor, action, thrills, family ties (pun intended!), and an assortment of great, oddball characters. Michael J. Fox (in his greatest accomplishment as an actor) is Marty McFly, a 1985 Hill Valley guitar-playing high-schooler who aspires to be a rock 'n roll star. He is the youngest child of working-class parents George and Lorraine McFly (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson in their best roles). George is working a dead-end job for his mean boss and high-school rival Biff (perfectly cast Thomas F. Wilson). George never realized his dream of being a science-fiction author due to primarily a lack of confidence and Marty doesn't want to follow in his father's footsteps. Marty also has a super hot girlfriend Jennifer (sexy Claudia Wells; I liked her much better than Elisabeth Shue in the sequels in the same role). And finally, last but not least, Marty has a mentor Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown (embodied by the great Christopher Lloyd in a performance that should have won him an Academy Award).Doc is a genius yet oddball scientist (what scientist isn't a little quirky?) builds a time machine composed of a DeLorean (remember that car? the Edsel of the 80s) and then the fun begins. At the town mall one night, Doc and Marty test out his time machine on Doc's dog Einstein and then Marty mistakenly (won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie) is transported back to 1955 in the machine and must figure a way to return home. But Marty screws up along the way to finding the young 1955 version of Doc and sets the process in motion that keeps his parents from meeting and falling in love, thereby endangering his very existence. So he and Doc have dual missions: to make his parents meet and fall in love and to fix the machine (damaged during the time travel) and get Marty, as Doc would say 'back to the future!' This is my favorite film of director Robert Zemeckis. WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT and FORREST GUMP were both overrated and don't have that 're-watchability factor' that BTTF has, even though both films garnered perhaps more critical praise and acclaim in their time. But BTTF is complete, utter, enjoyable fun from beginning to end. I still find myself today being impressed by the way Michael J. Fox convincingly carried this film, at Crispin Glover's manic, hilarious, comic acting style, at how sexy Lea Thompson was in this film, and finally, at Christopher Lloyd's brilliant characterization of Doc Brown. But more impressive is the fact that even though I've seen the film a lot of times, I'm still excited by several of it's signature scenes: young Biff and his gang chasing down a skateboarding Marty, Marty's wonderful rendition of ""Johnny Be Good"" at the Enchantment-Under-The-Sea dance, and of course the pulse-pounding, thrilling climax of Marty and Doc trying to put history back in order and send Marty back to the future. It's strange that there really has been no film like this since it came out in 1985. Maybe too difficult to re-create the magic of this one. There have been a lot of time travel films, but I believe this may be the best one in all of film history! Forget about the unequal sequels. This film is the standard by which all fantasy (and time travel) films of the modern era should be measured.","

"buddyboy28","7 July 2014","Michael J.Fox is perfectly cast as Marty Mcfly, a teenager who's family is dysfunctional to say the least. His mother Lorraine (Lea Thonpson) is an heavy drinker and his father George (Crispin Glover) is a complete loser who is still been stepped on by Biff Tannen (Thomas F.Wilson) the same guy who's been bullying him since high school. These things are the least of Marty's problems though when he is accidentally sent back to 1955 in his friend Doc Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) plutonium powered Delorean time machine, and jeopardises his own existence when he inadvertently interferes with his parents first meeting.The movie is huge fun. The cast is great. Fox and Lloyd are superb in their roles, as are the rest of the cast, and the plot itself is storytelling at it's finest. Not one single wasted moment. Every moment advances plot and character. Throwaway lines or minor moments usually have an important part to play in the story later on. It's hard to think of another movie that successfully blends so many genres together, if at all. Sci-fi, Comedy, Action, Romance, this has it all and it's great entertainment from start to finish.Many things about the movie have become iconic, from the Delorean, the quotes, and of course, Fox performing Johnny B.Goode. It's full of wit and clever ideas, and has aged superbly like fine wine.It has something for people of all ages, whether you're 5 or 85 it's a charming movie that has a lot to offer.","

"Pumpkin_Man","6 January 2009","This is an awesome time-traveling movie! I love everything about; the plot, the setting, the details, the actors, and the car! In case you are new to the series, I'll give you a brief synopsis. Marty McFly is down on his luck and one night, his friend Dr. Emmett Brown introduces him to the world of time travel. When Doc is shot by terrorists, Marty takes the time-traveling DeLorean and accidentally goes back to the year 1955. Marty seeks the help of the young Doc in order to get back to 1985. He meets his parents, and causes his smokin' hot mom to have a crush on him, rather than his dad. He tries to get them to fall in love at the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance before he disappears from time. Will Marty get back to his time and make his parents fall in love? I highly recommend BACK TO THE FUTURE!!!","

"Sirus_the_Virus","3 August 2009","The original Back to the future film was definitely the best in the series. It's even on my top five list. Back to the future is cute, funny, and an obvious classic. I know most of us have seen them, but i'll say what it's about. This is the first of three Back to the Future films. Marty Mcfly(the great Michael J. Fox) is a teen with boring parents, and a boring life and he has a girlfriend. His life is turned upside down when his friend Dr. Emmet Brown(the great Christopher Lloyd)shows him a delorean. Which is actually a time machine.That's where the entire trilogy began and the films continued after that. I love every Back to the Future film. I like the original the most, then I like parts II and III equally. The Back to the future films are nothing but fun and they're great movies. This is definitely Robert Zemekis's best film to date. He's done other great films like Romancing the stone, Beowulf, and Death Becomes her. Not one of the Back to the future films has any weakness. Back to the future is a film that should never be remade or anything. Knowing the world today, if they did remake it, then they would cast Shia Lebeouf as Marty. Michael j. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are irreplaceable. Don't remake it.","

"TheUnknown837-1","19 July 2007","What makes a good comedy movie? Just lots of dumb, pointless humor and no real plot. But what makes a good movie? A film with every feature containing quality, even the humor. So to have a really good comedy movie, at least in my opinion, it has to have EFFECTIVE humor WITH a point behind it, mixed with a good plot, good acting, storyline, and have a realistic feeling behind it. In other words, the humor must be something believable and of the possible. And it must all blend seamlessly with the rest of the quality parts of the film. And we get all of that in Robert Zemeckis's classic science fiction/comedy film ""Back to the Future"". This is the kind of comedy film that I wish we would see more often. It's like ""Forrest Gump"", it takes a realistic approach to life and then just blends it with the humor so that the audience doesn't concentrate so much on just laughing, but also understanding the plot and characters just as they would with a serious film. And as soon as they're done laughing at the lifelike jokes, then they focus back on the rest of the film.One thing I notice about a lot of comedy films that teenagers in particular seem to cherish and love is that the humor is crude and oftentimes, disturbing. And I suppose that if ""Back to the Future"" was made for teenagers alone, then the humor would be exactly the same. In this film, there is a subplot which some might think would end up being just disturbing and agitating to the audience. But when you look at it, it's not at all uncomfortable to the viewers, but instead works out effectively by not concentrating so much on just getting an uproar out of people. Of course, there is lots of jokes in the movie, mostly because of comedian Christopher Lloyd, who is at his top notch in ""Back to the Future"" as well as ""Back to the Future 2"". Not as much in the third part of the series. But he is especially keen in the first entry of the famous trilogy. And once again, his character of Dr. Emmett Brown is goofy and funny, but also has the traits where if you bumped into a person like this on the street, you wouldn't just sit back and laugh like he was just a dumb comedy feature. The character seems like he could be a real person.""Back to the Future"" is a very great film. Not just as a comedy, but also as a science-fiction film. The explanations of the time machine aren't just thrown together as they are with many films. The time machine isn't just 'created' by the scientist and not explained how it works our what it takes. There is a fairly logical explanation, and maybe a theory, as to how time travel could be possible but it doesn't so so into depth to the point where only professors would understand what's going on. That's the thing about this film. Nothing just happens. There's an explanation and a point for everything. And that's what I like to see in all films. Whether they're serious of just plain funny. Or both.","

It's lighthearted approach is spot on, the film has a suspenseful finale and last but not least the cast is the best.Michael J. Fox is just perfect in the lead and Christopher Lloyd is even more perfect as the crazy scientist who invents time-travel. Crispin Glover is hilarious as Fox's Dad, Leah Thompson has never been lovelier and Thomas F. Wilson is a riot as the ultimate bully (Wilson proved to be Part II's sole saving grace).Terrific filmmaker Robert Zemeckis directs with a sure hand, the film is fast paced, has a great soundtrack (Johnny B. Goode has never sounded better), great special effects, in short; Back to the Future has everything that a great comedy is supposed to have, in spades.Must have seen like 20 times and I never tire of it. This is timeless entertainment and in light of recent comedies one can better appreciate the level of fun this movie provides. They simply don't make 'em like this anymore.","

"sharky_55","18 January 2016","Time travel is a tricky subject in films. There's the old dilemma of all the paradoxes of timelines and butterfly effects and the awkward problem of trying to create conflict where the previous events have already established a status quo. Back to the Future neatly sidesteps this problem and presents an energetic mishmash of genres that became an instant hit and spawned an eager following. The script's building blocks pull together the plot intricately. Every little hint, every anecdote and appearance from the current timeline (Goldie Wilson's re-election van, the lighting struck clocktower) is re-enacted through the time machine back in 1955. You can only imagine the delight of audience at first seeing a young George McFly being subject to the same treatment, and recognising the fateful accident of the car hitting the young boy and gasp at how suddenly, the future is being morphed. And so we have a intriguing premise established so elegantly. Even now the opening sequence is brilliant. We have this rather cryptic voice message from what seems like an eccentric madman scientist about the big experiment, the news report just as the camera reveals the case of stolen plutonium, and true to the key theme, an immense collection of clocks that tick so irregularly and mysteriously. Michael J Fox sees all this, doesn't make too much of it, and then we zoom out to the enormous amplifier that seems to be fit for only one thing in his mind: a guitar solo. He's a rockstar, and as he skateboards through the town to the very appropriate Power of Love, presents us with so many clues and landmarks that we will later look for in the same place, but decades earlier.The opening sequence also does a lot of the lifting that creates the intrigue until we finally reveal Doc Brown and his crazy experiment. The iconic Delorean descending from the billowing smoke is epic, and so is the first attempt at hitting 88 miles an hour where the car flashes and disappears in a trail of fire. Zemeckis has become a household name for pioneering visual effects but it's the sort of low key work here that doesn't interfere with the excitement of the scientific breakthrough and lets our imaginations go wild (we see this again in the excellent world-building in the sequel). And in the ending, he hints just a little at the next adventure, and the sleek hover and fly off into the distance is short but sweet. There's also some inspired camera-work here and there. Cundey loves the dramatic crane up and reveals, and these work very effectively in the context of the narrative; the vast, undeveloped plains of Lyon Estate, and the triumphant sign of the fire trails after the lighting strike. Michael J Fox as the lead character is just perfect. His height adds an extra dimension to the heroism; Biff towers over him and it becomes something other than a physical confrontation (it would have been easy to write in the son beating up the bully for his father). He oozes cool - there's the impromptu moment where he creates the first skateboard and weaves in and out before dispatching the car of bullies, and a moment of pure cheesiness and romance which he turns into a rock and roll romp - but of course they haven't got to that musical period yet. And he's also capable of being less than all style - see the hilarious way in which he stumbles out of the Delorean and is mistaken for an alien and his ufo. Thompson's young Lorraine is also excellent; each lovestruck sigh and desiring murmur of the dreamboat Calvin Klein is adorable and reminds us that this is exactly how it happened, only with a different boy. The Oedipus angle of it all is handled well, and with humour (My name is Darth Vader) - it could have been creepy or uncomfortable, but Lorraine is sweet and the resolution is satisfying. There are little kinks here and there, and the Libyan terrorist shoot-out perhaps a little too goofy, but Back to the Future is a delight.","

"hall895","28 April 2012","How many movies can you honestly say you would never get tired of seeing? Most movies, no matter how notably excellent they may be, lose at least a little bit of their charm, their ability to thrill, when you've seen them a number of times. Back to the Future is one of those precious few movies for which the thrill is never gone. There's so much here. Action, adventure, humor, drama, romance. The story is fabulous. The performances are fabulous. The music is fabulous. Great characters, great dialogue, great effects. Pretty much great everything. And even if you know the movie by heart, and at this point I pretty much do, it doesn't get old. Not a bit. I'll go back in time with Marty McFly over and over again. What a fabulous journey Marty goes on. Lucky are we who are along for the ride.The story is wonderfully simple and yet incredibly intricate. Teenager Marty McFly is sent back in time, from 1985 to 1955. In 1955 the most beautiful girl you'll ever see falls for Marty. Lorraine Baines is the dream girl any guy would fall in love with...if she weren't his mother. Yes, Marty's mom now has the hots for him instead of his father. Marty has prevented his parents from falling in love. If he doesn't fix that he will be erased from existence. Of course there is also the small matter of getting back to 1985. Thankfully Marty has a friend in 1955 who can help, Doc Brown. Marty and Doc, one of the great pairings in movie history.The movie starts a little slowly as it sets itself up. But then Marty and Doc come together in that shopping mall parking lot and the magic begins. From the moment Marty hops into that DeLorean and revs it up to 88 this movie is sheer perfection. Michael J. Fox, playing Marty, is obviously the glue holding the whole thing together and he is magnificent. But Christopher Lloyd, playing Doc, may be most indispensable of all. Could there be any other Doc Brown? With gestures and reactions and facial expressions Lloyd brought this character to life in a way nobody else could. He can say it all without saying a word. Of course when he does say something that's memorable too. 1.21 gigawatts! If having the kooky Lloyd playing the exceedingly kooky Doc Brown weren't enough we also get Crispin Glover playing Marty's father George. Or would-be father once Marty screws things up. Glover is a performer quite unlike any other and he makes George his own. What a fabulous job he did. Thomas F. Wilson makes for a great villain with Biff, hated in two generations. And Lea Thompson as Lorraine? Now that's a girl worth getting run over by a car for. Thompson certainly looks the part of the dream girl but she proves to be much more than just a pretty face. Her performance is perfect. The sweet, innocent 1950s girl. Or is she really that innocent?This is a story which had to be worked out meticulously and it was. Any missteps unravel everything. But at heart it's still rather simple which makes the story, and the characters, so easy to embrace. Director Robert Zemeckis tied it all together brilliantly. The story, the characters, the actors...it was a perfect storm which came together to produce true movie magic. This is a movie which is not just enjoyed, it is beloved. And it should be. What's your favorite Back to the Future moment? Is it one that makes you laugh? One that makes you cheer? Or one that makes you want to get up and dance? Go, go! Go Johnny go! Yeah, even the music in this movie is perfect as Marty desperately tries to get back to 1985. Ah yes, 1985, that glorious moment in time where if you wanted to put a really cool rock star in your movie you went out and got Huey Lewis. Everybody, Huey included, plays their part in this glorious movie. By the time the end comes, with one of the greatest closing lines in movie history because this movie is perfect right to the end, you want to stand and cheer. No matter how many times you've seen it. No matter if you're all by yourself in your living room. Stand. Cheer. You know you want to. And this movie deserves it.","

"fatherchristmas89","30 December 2014","This film is timeless because it is about a topic that will always intrigue us, time travel and what would life be like if history was changed. It has aged very well, and I think it will continue to do so. The film is about a teenager, Marty, that is having trouble in school, his father is being bullied by his supervisor and his mother constantly reminisces about the past. He is friends with a mad inventor, who stole plutonium for a time machine, as was shot because of it. Marty, to avoid being shot himself, climbs aboard the time machine and is accidental sent back in time to when his father met his mother. As he prevented his parents meeting, Marty then has to get his parents together so that he can be born. I loved the ending 'you need to come with me, back to the future'. A perfect way to set it up for a sequel. I thoroughly enjoyed it!","

"vip_ebriega","12 May 2008","My Take: A modern classic sci-fi comedy.Still stands out as one of the most creative and funny comedies of all time, as well as a creative piece of science fiction, BACK TO THE FUTURE is fun, funny as well as fast-paced and very entertaining. Greatly contributing from a clever screenplay and playful yet professional handling by director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg, BACK TO THE FUTURE is a classic of its kind, and I think it's also one of a kind.The special effects have surely dated a bit, considering that the pattern for effects have advanced through the years. But they're still a lot of elaborate fun. Besides, perhaps the real ""special effect"" of the film is the clever screenplay. Written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, the script has dozens of very clever and ingenious ideas. The entire concept explanation of time travel remains original and brilliant until now, even providing some inspiration for other time-travel films 'ala BLAST FROM THE PAST.Michael J. Fox plays the teenage Marty McFly, who is accidentally whisked back in the year 1955 when he hops aboard a time-traveling Delorean created by the near-mad Dr. E. Brown, or simply Doc (played hilariously by Christopher Lloyd). Once there, he gets into trouble with his would-be parents, still teenagers, when her would-be mother (Lea Thompson) falls in love with him, instead of his would-be father (Crispin Glover), which sets the film's hilarious comedy with a difference.Despite some occasionally bad language, BACK TO THE FUTURE is perfect family entertainment, and I think it still is. It's fun and original, something that most recent, more expensive blockbusters can't do at the same time. And unlike most films that it could have been, BACK TO THE FUTURE doesn't get bogged down to a pure special effects exhibition. The film has a lot of fun with its actors and script, and values them as much as any million dollar effects thrown in. For those, very few, who haven't seen it, don't afford to miss it! Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.","

"Stampsfightclub","5 November 2009","Marty McFly (Fox) is sent back in time to the year 1955 where he must make sure his parents meet and fall in love, otherwise his existence is in danger.This renowned Oscar winning sci-fi has everything you need for a entertaining viewing, whether with family or a quiet solo night in. Action, comedy and adventure this ticks all the right boxes and is a film we can look at and say is a fine depiction of time travelling mischief and bravery.There have been numerous films to attempt to unravel the complexity of time travel. From The Terminator to the Butterfly effect we have robots and unexplained seizures telling a theory on how travelling through the void can happen.In this 1985 release the complexity of the lexis is weighed down to a comedy level to fit the mood of the moment, and through the wonderfully buoyant Emmet Brown we see his theory of the flux-capacitor and the use of plutonium to achieve the unachievable is brilliant appreciation of the target audience. There is no over the top scientific knowledge as we take Dr Brown as he is an overly knowledgeable protagonist, and doesn't Christopher Lloyd do well? The star shows a very eccentric style to portray a subtle madness and delicious exuberance to deliver one wonderful mad scientist that gives the film, and trilogy, its main source of comedy and resourcefulness.Lets not forget Michael J Fox in arguably his most profound role from his illustrious career as the unbelievably cool teen who gets wrapped up in events. Fox's appreciation for cool is never over the top and fits even today's modern teenage stereotype. But to associate him with today would be unfair. He is way too cool for any kind of label. He skateboards, he has an attractive girlfriend, he plays the guitar and drinks Pepsi, what more can you say? He is the coolest kid in time.Whilst the plot is easy to enjoy and relaxing unconditional fun there is a level of importance of attention to be maintained as the plot's intention of science bases itself on a few key rules. Such as what can alter the future, saying the wrong thing and the difference from the present and the future. All run however thoroughly and with plenty of zest and humour to satisfy any viewer's entertainment requirements.The opening sequence with the clocks is fantastic panning and good timing (no pun intended) as Marty enters and blasts the stereo. This sets the tone for the coolness of the main character and builds everything around the complexity of time.This really is fantastic fun with wonderful characters and a springy adventurous minded script that never hinders on the past, not literally obviously. Parts II and III are well balanced fun, but this was where it all started and what a fantastic beginning it was","

"khanbaliq2","27 April 2010","I wasn't excited to review Back To The Future because it has become a very popular film, but, after watching it again, I took out my pen and some recycled paper to get it over with. Before writing my review, I read and watched a number of materials about the making of the film. In my opinion, Back To The Future is one of the best science fiction films, even if it is a product of a big Hollywood studio (in this case Universal Pictures). It's one of the founding films in the special effects action blockbuster genre, though few of its successors have half its wit, charm or grace. The entertainment industry now realizes how important it is, and, therefore, the film has been promoted in the media and at conventions. But that's fine. I like it too. So, why do many people like Back To The Future? Firstly, it's an entertaining science fiction comedy. Secondly, its message of changing one's life for the better with a courageous act appeals to the masses. Thirdly, it's a well-cast and well-made 1980s movie. Back To The Future is simply pleasant to watch. Americans can watch it and be reminded of better times - the 1980s and especially the 1950s. Robert Zemeckis directed two good films before Back To The Future - the comedies Used Cars (1980) and Romancing The Stone (1984). In Back To The Future, Zemeckis demonstrated his technological savvy and attention to detail. The DeLorean DMC-12 time machine looks fantastic. The car was chosen because its design made the gag about the family of farmers mistaking it for a flying saucer believable. When it comes to the excellent cast, the friendship of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) works very well. It's entirely believable, and it works even better in the sequels - Back To The Future II (1989) and Back To The Future III (1990). The eager, likable Fox is actually good when it comes to the comedy. Also, his upbeat approach to his roles made him perfect for the part of Marty. Lloyd, as the irascible, sardonic Doc Brown, offers sterling support. Another excellent performance is by Crispin Glover as George McFly, the cowardly, nerdy father of Marty. In fact, Glover's performance may be the most effective in the film, and he's funny when it comes to George's nerdy mannerisms, such as his shaky hands. Lorraine Baines-McFly is actress Lea Thompson's most famous role. Zemeckis wanted her for the part after he saw her in The Wild Life (1984), opposite Eric Stoltz. Stoltz played the part of Marty before Zemeckis determined that he had been miscast. It turns out that Thompson is good at impressions. I found her body movements and facial expressions interesting as she played the somewhat shy 1950s teenager Lorraine. She's especially effective in the second half of the film. In addition to the lovely plot and perfect cast, Back To The Future features a wonderful music score by Alan Silvestri. The rock band Huey Lewis and the News provided two catchy songs - The Power of Love and Back in Time. So, there's a lot to like about the film. It's an appealing slice of bourgeois Americana. I have a few issues with its messages, but I definitely recommend it.","

"Ruskington","21 April 2020","Not only is Back To The Future my personal favourite film, it would surely rank as one of the best family films of all-time, if not the best. The combination of a wonderfully creative story, perfect casting, great comic delivery and an incredible ending make for an astounding piece of cinema.As with all time-travel stories, there are some serious flaws of logic that you can't help notice (how did they know the lightning would strike at dead-on 11:04 and not in any of the other 59 seconds of that particular minute?). But these glitches are minor and are thoroughly overridden by the exhilarating story.Christopher Lloyd and Michael J Fox are the heart and soul of this film and these two men turn in performances that will forever be remembered by everyone who loves Back To The Future.","

"BJG-Reviews","7 April 2021","The stage curtains open ...I was 16 when ""Back to the Future"" came out. One month after it was released to theaters, ""Teen Wolf"" also hit the big screen. That was a busy summer for Michael J. Fox, who starred in both films. One of my friends had gone to see them both and then reported that ""Teen Wolf"" was the best one of the two. So, I did what he did ... I watched them both as a double feature. After I had watched both films, I wondered what he was on, because ""Back to the Future"" was CLEARLY the best movie. And to this day, it remains one of my all-time favorites.Marty McFly (Fox) is your average 80's teen who dreams of someday making it big as a rock star, has a hot girlfriend, skateboards his way around town, and who has a close friendship with a bit of a madcap scientist named Emmett Brown (Christopher LLoyd), who he affectionately calls Doc. One night, Doc has Marty meet him at the parking lot of a mall where he unveils his latest project ... a DeLorean he has converted into a time machine. During a mishap, Marty is accidentally sent back to the year 1955 where he runs into his parents when they were his age. Now Marty faces the reality of being erased from existence, unless the 1955 Doc Brown can help him get back to the future.I absolutely loved this movie when I first saw it, and I still do today. To say that it is a classic would actually be an understatement, though it truly is. It is the essence of movie magic, and helped to influence countless people, having a large impact on future movies and future lives. It is still just as pertinent today as it was back then. The humor is matched only by it's excitement - and both were abundant. The special effects were great for their time, the cast was strong, and the music memorable.I can't recommend this movie enough. Some people comment on the relationship between Marty and his mother as a teen as being inappropriate - well, if that is all you got out of it, you missed the point completely. ""Back to the Future"" is viable and entertaining, and has its rightful place in the lore of film legends. This is a perfect 10 stars out of 10. If only they made movies like this today.","

"Animany94","23 June 2019","Back To The Future has not become a classic without reason. It's an engaging time travel adventure with high entertainment value without being gimmicky.The intereaction between the 1985 Marty McFly and the '55 environment is so well written with lots of wit and heart that you can't help guessing what will happen next and what consequences could happen. And the writers knew that, so they put in some dillemmas and suspenseful moments which rids the movie from any dull moments and keeps the audience's attention throughout.The two central roles of Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown played by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd respectively are so good! Memorable in every way even if their characterizations sound generic at first, they just play them out so well you can't dislike them. Seeing Marty's family and acquaintances in the past is also a whole lot of fun.Good music, a well written script, great performances, good pacing and an instant classic is secured to delight everyone.","

"jamesjustice-92","12 December 2020","What is there to say about this movie that hasn't been said already? It's a masterpiece, absolute and total masterpiece, and even having watched it a hundredth time I will say the same thing. It's been 35 years since its release and about 20 years since I first saw it on the TV and I am still amazed how good and fresh it looks, especially on the big screen. Incredible score by Alan Silvestri, near perfect performances by Michael J., Christopher L. and so many others, fantastic script by Bobs and outstanding direction by Bobby Z., immortal ""The power of love"" by Huey ""darn loud"" Lewis & the News and the whole soundtrack - I love everything about Back to the Future. It's my favorite movie of all times and despite, I admit it, being a little silly and naïve it pulls just about right amount of strings in my heart and keeps me on the edge of the seat until the end every. single. time. Once you've fallen in love with Marty, Doc, Jennifer, Biff, Lorraine, George and all the rest of them outstanding characters you will not be able to live your life the way you used to before that movie came into it. Trust me. You may not be needing any roads in the future you're heading to but this movie you have to have along with you.","

Fox) is a bit of a slacker but his family is full of losers. His Dad is bullied by the neighbour Biff and has been since school.McFly hangs out with a crazy scientist and is accidentally sent back to 1955 in a time machine Doc has made out of a car.He is fleeing some Libyan terrorists who Doc stole plutonium from, which is needed to power the flux capacitor,In 1955 McFly accidentally alters the moment his Mum starts to fall in love with his Dad and his Mum starts to fall in love with him and this could cause him never to be born.He gets the help of a younger Doc Brown to get back in time using a lighting strike he knows the exact time and date of because there is no plutonium but he also has to correct the mistakes he has made that could change the future and make his Dad fall in love with his Mum.The Clock scene which is paying tribute to Safety Last manages to top the scene it is based on.His Dad also stands up to the Bully which alters the present but makes everything better.One of the best films of the 80's and all time.","

"lisafordeay","23 October 2015","Re-editBack To The Future is a 1985 Sci fi adventure starring Michael J Fox,Christopher Lloyd,Lea Thompson and Crispin Clover. Directed by Robert Zemeckis,and produced by Steven Speilberg,the story is about a young teen named Marty McFly(Fox)who teams up with a Dr named Doc Brown(Lloyd) who happens to be a time traveller. So he invents this car called DeLeoran that can bring you back in time. So McFly ends up taking the DeLeoran and ends up in October 21st 1955 where he has to try and bring his parents (Glover and Thompson)back together again. But when McFly's mother ends up falling for McFly things get sorta complicated. So can McFly go back to his own time?Bottom line this was a feel good movie and I highly recommend it. The story is a tad bit silly,the music is great by Hewy Lewis and the acting was great. Keep an eye out for a very young Billy Zane as Match(Biff's best friend).Classic.","

Cokehead theories aside this is one of those movies that sums up the 80's quite nicely. Between Micheal J Fox and Huey Luis and the News on the soundtrack you can't get much more 80's. It's another movie like Ghostbusters that you watch as a kid, then see as an adult and notice alot of adult themed jokes you didn't even notice as jokes as a kid.

"rebeljenn","13 November 2005","This is the film that started it all. Back to the Future is an original film in which time travel meets comedy. The film is told well with plenty of jokes. One of the best things about it is that it makes science fiction look 'cool' and introduces that genre to a wider audience who previously thought that science fiction was all about geeks dressed up looking like Star Trek characters. There is a good blend of comedy and action, and the general public was able to appreciate it for the comedy and popular culture -- and for the 1950s jokes and characters that we can identify with. If you haven't seen it, this is a film that should not be missed. I am glad to see that it is still popular.","

"wright-alex2","19 September 2020","What to say about Back to the Future? A trilogy that animated my childhood and continues to do so with as much panache and reverence as it did when I first laid eyes on the duo of Doc and Marty. A friendship that shouldn't exist, yet the chemistry that binds them is uniquely special and fluently conferrable on screen.Not a Sci-Fi person? No need to be - this is packed with action, emotion and intelligence. It feeds the curious and demanding brain with complex twists and turns, and characters overlaying each other in a vast time continuum.These films are clever, sinuous; they are peppered with flashbacks and parallelisms, thus keeping you entertained throughout. Expect great one-liners (""Where we're going, we don't need... roads"").It's undoubtedly the trilogy with the most re-watchability in existence, excepting, perhaps, the original Star Wars tri.BTTF contains all the key ingredients you want in a great film, from great characters to great storyline and brilliant music to accompany and set the tone each scene. It had me on tenterhooks throughout, and I am not an easygoing cinema critic.I can't, can't recommend it enough. After watching all three films, your life will forever be richer.","

"Bogmeister","12 March 2006","There aren't too many time travel movies around, mainly because ""The Time Machine,"" ""The Time Travelers"" and ""Time After Time"" films pretty much covered the subject. Then ""Star Trek"" used up the premise in its TV episodes and films, and there was even that ""Time Tunnel"" TV series in the mid-sixties. One option was to do such a movie with humor, pointing out the potentially absurd ramifications of traveling to your own past. So the main character of Marty McFly (Fox) ends up meeting his own parents when they were his age. Though this is a relatively tame comedy as far as teenage comedies of the eighties, there is the risky Oedipal element of Marty's own mother having the hots for him. This concept is then tossed aside near the end when, in a rather lame scene, his mom stops her advances because she suddenly feels like she's kissing her own brother. Disney should've went with this after all - it's possibly the least offensive picture of the decade and probably also explains its huge popularity - everyone could enjoy it.What elevates this above the common film are a few things: Glover's performance as Marty's father, both in younger & older incarnations, is deliriously eccentric; where everyone else is kind of in TV-movie mode, he's off in his own zone and hard to forget. There's an energy to the entire story thrust (from director Zemeckis), helped by Fox, who always seems anxious about something. The concept of time travel itself gets a clever redux here; we find out you can actually change reality in the present by your actions in the past - there's no mention of creating a parallel universe, for example. The ending is pretty strong, throwing in an extra whammy when we think things are over and everything is back to exactly the way it was. And it's very entertaining to watch Marty explore the fifties - we see through his eyes - the culture shock and making various connections between the older and new decades is a nice routine. There were also a couple of wildly funny moments involving Marty dressed up as an alien from outer space.","

"nicholls_les","10 March 2009","Hard to find fault with this film in any way. This is the only film I have watched in the Cinema where the audience broke out in spontaneous applause at it's conclusion. Michael J Fox was perfect for the part and all the cast and Christopher Lloyd is exceptional, creating one of those characters that you will always remember. The 2 sequels are both good but nothing matches this first film and the excitement it generates. My only small criticism was the Johnny B Goode scene where a supposed relative of Chuck Berry says to him on the phone 'I've found that new sound you were looking for' .... When will black music artists start getting credit for giving us all the great genres of music? OK I know it was tongue in cheek humour but it just annoys me. Rant over! It is still a 10/10 movie.","

Well maybe that isn't totally fair, but you know what I mean.And for a Time Travel movie, it doesn't really mess up too badly in terms of continuity or paradoxes. The movie handles it all pretty much in stride. I can get kind of nitpicky about stuff, and I never felt betrayed or hornswaggled by the filmmakers on this one.I will always suggest this to friends, and if you haven't seen it then put it on your list!","

"RossRivero99","11 July 2014","Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future is a very entertaining science fiction film of which is also pretty funny at times as well. The movie stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly a teenager who was sent 3 decades back into the past all the way from present day 1985 to early November 1955 in a vehicle that runs on plutonium that was invented by his friend Dr. Emmett Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd). But when he travels back in time and visits his mother's house at the time he was young he has a huge problem which is that his teenage mother is in love with him instead of his future father. Zemeckis really knows good visual effects, a film i consider the best science fiction movie from the 1980's sine executive producer Steven Spielberg's 1982 classic E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Not only that this works as a science fiction classic, it also works as a comedic family adventure. This movie is a huge sci-fi entertainment for the whole family to see.","

"JamesIan2021","26 July 2015","Come on, Back to The Future isn't all that great. Yes it has its moments, courtesy of Christopher Lloyd's slightly crazy Doc, Michael J. Fox' wide eyed looks of confusion and some superb special effects but the pace falters, the humour runs dry one too many times and because of all the positive buzz, constant recommendations and reviews stating it to be one of the best films, and standing high in the IMDb top 250 I can't help but feel disappointed and underwhelmed. Robert Zemeckis is a good director, countless hit films especially Flight which is an incredible movie. But people hailing this as some of his finest work? No, seriously this is an average film at best.","

"Philipp_Flersheim","2 April 2022","For me, no other film captures the spirit of the 80s as well as 'Back to the Future': the coolness, the fun, the music - if you want to re-live the experience (or feel it for the first time, if you have the misfortune of having been born too late), watch Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) going back to 1955. Robert Zemeckis has created a film that is as close to perfect as anything could possibly be. I won't go into the details of acting, plot, photography etc. 'Back to the Future' is irresistable, and that's it.","

"claszdsburrogato","1 January 2024","Back to the Future is an undisputed classic of cinema and science fiction as a whole. The film still works as an entertaining work, however, that doesn't mean it isn't a product of its time. The way the narrative is executed, the comedy is inserted and even how the visuals are displayed is, without a shadow of a doubt, dated. Does this mean that the work is bad seen through today's eyes? No. The work well portrays its time and the vision of the future that society had. Everything here is a huge reflection of the 80s. Even so, the work doesn't become any less thought-provoking and fun. Every film will always be dated when seen decades later, but that doesn't make it bad.The film, from the beginning, tells the viewer, in an indirect way, what will happen at the end of this story. This is one of the strong points of this film. Back to the Future thinks about many details to make the story round, even if the script falls into problems presented in works that explore time travel. The most important detail of the narrative is exactly how everything is extremely connected. All the scenes presented during the film are important for the development of the narrative and show importance again throughout it. Small details shown in small scenes always return to close the story in a satisfactory way and still leave a hook for a continuation.During many moments the small details presented are not said by the characters, but shown by small images in the foreground. The film takes advantage of small occasions to develop the narrative for the viewer, even though these details often don't seem important at first. Some scenes perfectly demonstrate the differences between the past and future using only the scenery and signs.Back to the Future is a brilliant work that marked its time and is still remembered today as a great classic. The film is extremely fun and its comedic moments are wonderful. The experience of watching this film is unique and becomes even more special when reviewed.","

"ryansassy1","21 October 2012","Recipe for fun: take one teenaged boy from 1985, a ""mad"" scientist who's obsessed with finally getting his 30-year experiment to work, and a very special Delorean--mix in some family troubles and a complicated love triangle; cut in some quotable dialog; heat it up with plenty of action; remove from the '80s and let cool in the '50s; and top it all with Huey Lewis and the News.There may be one or two people left on the planet who don't know the plot to Back to the Future. Okay: Young Marty is accidentally sent back in Doc Brown's Delorean from 1985 to 1955 and has to contact eccentric Doc's 30-years-younger version to help him get back to the future. (See what I did there? Clever, right?) Marty's biggest challenge is to not change anything in his past that could adversely affect the future -- say, preventing his mom and dad from falling in love, which would jeopardize his very existence. OOops! That's already messed up, so now he must correct the mishap or he'll disappear before he can get back to 1985.Every element of Back to the Future works to create the coolest comedy of its decade. The comic situations that result from Marty trying to play matchmaker to his own parents are very well-played. Of course the best fun comes in when we get to experience (and in some cases, re-experience) the '50s from an '80s perspective. All these good times are helped along by having the easily likable Michael J Fox in the lead and the incomparable Christopher Lloyd as the hyperactive Doc -- a role he was born to play. Unflagging, quotable dialog powers the plot wonderfully.Back to the Future is the kind of movie that can appeal to anybody from ages 10 to 100. When I saw this in the theater in '85 it was an instant hit across all cliques from the nerds to the jocks -- my generation's primer on time travel movies. I remember laughing right along with my mom and my little sisters. Not that many films manage to pull off that kind of magic, then or now.","

"FilmFanInTheHouse","12 June 2007","Back to the Future (1985, Dir. Robert Zemeckis) Story The year is 1985 and Marty McFly is your everyday teenager, except for one problem. He is stuck in 1955. After his good friend Doc Emmett Brown is gunned down, Marty ends up sending the DeLorean back twenty years into the past. Now, he must find the Doc and convince him that he is from the future, in order for the Doc to send him back to the future, but this is the least of Marty's problem. After accidentally getting in the way of the important meeting between his future mother and father, Marty must get them back together before he changes time forever, and destroys his own existence. This is the start of the successful 'Back to the Future' trilogy.Actors Thing important thing about this type of film is that you really need the right stars in order for the story to successfully work. Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly, the lead character in the movie. He sits the role well of a normal teenager. He can really see the expressions his face, especially when he forgets he's in the past where no one can remember him. Doc Emmett Brown is played by Christopher Lloyd who is probably the best character in the film. His mad movements and acting style, added to his crazy look really made him seem like an actual scientist, who is trying to actually create something beyond reality. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover portray the mother and father of Marty McFly. Something which isn't often in films today is the same actor playing both the teen and adult version of their character. They were very well cast for the role and the makeup in which they go through really makes them look older, without making it to obvious. All the characteristics remain intact when both young and old.Music The music in the film which is composed by Alan Silvestri includes a few memorable themes but not a huge amount. The theme for the film is quite impressive and is not over used. Its main use of the use is found the actions scenes. Apart from these select few examples, the score can be very quiet. It's really hard to think of a piece of the score which does not include the theme. There are also music from Huey Lewis and The News. These aren't used out of place and still fit in with what's happening on screen.Special Effects Many people see 'Back to the Future' as a special effects film, but this isn't really the case. There are very few special effects shots in the film, but what does appear is quite impressive. There are a mixture of shots which would fit in well with a film today. One shot for example, is when the car disappears and the fire appears along the road. This particular effect would look out of place today, but still is viewable and enjoyable. The final shot in the film, where the care rises in the air and flies towards the camera is a lot better, and it perfectly blends in with the sky and looks very realistic.Conclusion 'Back to the Future' is a wonderful and classic family film which as survived through so many years and still has the enjoyable factor needed to watch it. It's not too long and not too short, and a perfect family film too watch together or even on your own.""What happens to us in the future? Do we become @$$holes or something?""  Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox)","

"DavidSim240183","9 January 2005","I first saw Back to the Future a year ago. I couldn't believe I'd avoided seeing it for so long. It has to be one of the most enjoyable time travel stories ever put on the big screen, because it uses science fiction, and grounds the story in human emotion.Robert Zemeckis made a name for himself as a director with Back to the Future, because it was with this film he demonstrated how his storytelling can be likened to Frank Capra. In other words, he infused the intricacies of time travel with a benign, gentle touch, and with his own sensibilities too.Beginning in 1985, our tale centres around Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox). A typical teen of the 80's into skateboarding, rock n roll and girls, he is a young man who just wants to prove himself. He believes he can break the family curse common with all McFly's. Marty could actually amount to something.The rest of his family are really just a bunch of losers. Marty's father, George McFly, is the biggest loser going. He is an overgrown nerd who enjoys corny sitcoms and not much else. George has zero self-confidence, and allows himself to be antagonised, especially at the hands of his own personal tormentor Biff Tannen.Then there is Marty's mother Lorraine, who is an alcoholic, smokes, and looks older than she should. Its also clear she is in an unhappy marriage. Just look at her face when thinking about life with George. You really feel sorry for her.Marty's brother Dave is a pizza delivery boy, and his sister Linda must be the youngest old maid ever. Marty is really the only normal person in the family. The only bright spots in his life are his girlfriend Jennifer, and his friendship with the wacky inventor, Doc Brown (the brilliantly nutty Christopher Lloyd).Doc Brown is one of those eccentric kooks with a twinkle in their eye right out of a Jules Verne novel. One night, he needs Marty's help with his latest experiment. He has converted a DeLorean into a working time machine.Powered by plutonium, and at 88mph, it can literally travel through time in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately, Libyan terrorists Doc double-crossed have caught up with him, and kill him. Marty avoids the same fate by jumping into the DeLorean, and accidentally sends himself 30 years into the past.1955 is completely alien to Marty, and an even bigger shock awaits him, when he meets his future parents who are still teenagers. Marty interferes with their first meeting, and puts his own existence in jeopardy. If George and Lorraine don't get together, Marty will never be born. And that's just one of the problems he has to contend with! Since the DeLorean runs on plutonium, and used it up when Marty made the trip to 1955, he is now stranded. Fortunately, with the help of the Doc Brown living in 1955, they hatch a plan to get Marty home. In one week, a lightning bolt will strike the Hill Valley clock tower. By using its power, it will generate the electricity the DeLorean needs to make the return trip to 1985.If all of this sounds complicated, it isn't. Back to the Future isn't nearly as complex as it sounds. It is wonderfully entertaining. Marty becomes George's best friend, and helps him find the confidence he needs to stand up to Biff. Marty playing matchmaker to his parents is not only fun to watch, but also amusing. Lorraine falls for Marty herself, which further complicates his agenda.Although I am not a big fan of Michael J. Fox, he was spot on as Marty. He brings the right amount of teenage rebellion to the role, as well as amazement at his situation. He also has a terrific chemistry with Christopher Lloyd.I can't imagine anyone else as Doc Brown. He is so zany, but so sincere. His hand gestures and body language are perfect, since he modelled his performance on the composer Leopold Stokowski. Every move he makes is always like addressing an audience.The idea of a DeLorean as a time machine was brilliant. It is great to look at, and also provides one of the best visual gags in the film. After Marty first arrives, the family who see the car mistake it for a flying saucer with its gull-wing doors.There are so many terrific scenes I could go on forever. Some of the most memorable are George standing up to Biff, George and Lorraine's first kiss, and Marty's attempt to return to 1985. You can't help rooting for George and Lorraine, because you really want them to get together. What is more satisfying, is because they meet under different circumstances, they become better people as a result.Marty playing Johnny B. Goode is great too, especially when he confounds the audience with their first taste of rock n roll. It really gets intense and gripping towards the end, because you don't know how things will turn out for Marty. The musical score by Alan Silvestri helps no end, which is so uplifting and exciting.Robert Zemeckis also showed his flair for special effects with Back to the Future. They hold up well after 20 years, and unlike most directors, Zemeckis incorporates them without overshadowing the characters.Back to the Future is by far the best of the trilogy, because of its simplified theme. Part II broke that rule, and was too complicated for its own good. Part III made a welcome return to the simplification that made Part I such a big hit.Back to the Future showed that science fiction can be used to promote humanistic values. Groundhog Day did the same thing for romantic comedies. There probably will never be a time travel story as compelling and heartwarming as Back to the Future.","

"xiaoli7377","12 December 2022","""Back to the Future"" is simply a must watch classic. Peak 80s era blockbuster movie magic. It's funny, whimsical, and charming. I can't think of anyone who doesn't love this movie. The cast is all teaming with great chemistry, the writing is all superb. I love the fact that this movie has that ever-present layer of nostalgia surrounding it. Must have been nostalgic for people back in the 80s to see a ""present day"" person step back to the 50s, and it retains that nostalgia as a time capsule in the 80s moments.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are both great as the leading characters. Marty's parents (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) are great in supporting roles. Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) is one of my favorite movie villains of all time. He gets more time to shine in ""Part II"", but here he's great as well.You owe it to yourself to watch it, and if you aren't grinning ear to ear by the time the credits roll, then you probably oughta ""make like a tree and get out of here.""","

"kdnor2011","1 April 2010","Back to the Future could just be one of the most perfect movies ever made. I'm not one to bash other people's opinions, no matter how much I disagree with them, but I can't understand how you can't like this movie. Maybe think it's overrated, but if you live on this planet, you should like this movie. It isn't my favorite movie of all time, but I can find more flaws in movie's I like more than this.Really, all I can do is nitpick the movie, like how Biff is more of a serial killer than a bully, but what would be the point, it would still just be nitpicking. So yes, it does have some small flaws, but that doesn't stop the movie from being a masterpiece.OK, the good stuff now, first, there is something in this movie for everyone. It has comedy, it has romance, it has science fiction, it's a high school movie, there isn't much action, but that skateboard chase is pretty awesome. So basically if you want any of those types of movies, you will get it with this film.The characters are so much fun, and very memorable. Marty is extremely likable, Doc is hilarious, Biff is such an asshole yet you still can't help but enjoy him, Lorraine is hot, and George has some great moments. And I love the story, time travel is one of those things that has been around for years and will never get old. Everything works, and I love the little background jokes it does, like how Marty meets Doc at the Twin Pines Mall, goes back, knocks down a tree, and comes back and it's the Lone Pine Mall.The special effects are great, it's funny as hell, and it's just a lot of fun to watch. It really is one of the most perfect films ever made, the only way to criticise the film is to nitpick, and if you have to do that, then is there really any point in criticising at all?","

""Back to the Future"" tells the story of Marty McFly, who accidentally gets transported into a time machine, built by a wacko-genius scientist named Dr. Emmett Brown, and accidentally gets sent into 1955, and interacts with his parents as teenagers. Know he must get his teen parents together before the space-time continuum can mean the end of the world, and he must get back home to 1985 quickly. Now, I'm a big fan of science fiction, and this movie is a gigantic time-travel masterpiece. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd both lead an all-star cast with incredible and hilarious performances. The cast also includes the many great performances of Lea Thompson, Thomas F.

The sound is super and superb, the visual effects are groundbreaking, the cast is incredible, the soundtrack is awesome, the score is amazing, the characters are well-memorable, and everything about this movie makes me wait for more, and I'm always entertained by this movie, even when watching over and over again.

"kimberleyschmidt","30 March 2022","In fact, I saw the film for the first time properly a few days ago, which is a shame, because I actually like such old movies very much and the film is simply cult! He has a very classic humor and films in which the mother falls in love with her son would probably no longer exist today. Rightly so, because it provided the one or other cringe moment.Due to the cult status I had very high expectations of the film, which unfortunately were not quite met, but I was not completely disappointed either. The film has wit and you fever with Marty, who tries to bring everything back in order. Like many films from these years, it has a very pleasant mood and you could fully immerse yourself in the story. Even though some elements were very predictable, you were surprised in some places. I must say that I liked the first part best. The second was also still okay, but the third would not have been necessary in my opinion.Clear recommendation to all who have not yet seen the film, because it is simply a must-watch!","

"alexpeychev","25 January 2021","Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic state. The 80's saw a lot of excellent original fun 'young' films like 'Back To The Future' (of course), 'Better Off Dead', 'Heathers', 'The Breakfast Club' etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.Back to 'Back To The Future'. This one is sheer fun, even today. There's an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an 'innocent' film. The music is very effective. It's slick and follows a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it's brainless entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex's story.The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.'Back To The Future' is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It's over 23 years old and it still hasn't gotten old. Sadly, they don't make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them. That's why they're classics.","

"zeekwunlau","22 April 2020","What matters is not the past, but the present and the future.Maybe this is what the movie ""Back to the Future"" is about to tell us.Martin lived in an ordinary family from an early age. His father was weak and incompetent. He had no other hobbies than watching TV and eating. And often bullied by his boss. Martin was also looked down upon by the teacher at school, because this teacher was also the teacher of his father George thirty years ago.The mother married her dad because of compassion. After marriage, she lived in fantasy and gradually became an alcoholic and obese woman.His older sister and older brother also lacked talent. His older brother worked as an ordinary worker, and his older sister was as bloated as her mother and lacked charm.But in such a family, Martin is a person with ideals and vitality.He played skateboarding fascinatingly, and organized his own band, self-innovated genre, he also became a year-end friend with a Frankenstein.It was Martin's maverick that changed the fate of this family.In an accidental experiment, he took a time machine made by a doctor back to thirty years ago. And met the parents of the year.And even more accidentally, he actually became the object of his mother's admiration instead of his father.If he cannot make his parents a lover at the time destined, he will disappear from the earth.Therefore, a series of actions to match his parents were put into practice, and in the process, with his continuous encouragement, his father George finally became brave, and finally won the heart of Martin's mother with his personality charm.Of course, the most interesting thing is at the end. When Martin overcomes many difficulties and returns to the future, everything in the family has changed.The elder brother became a senior clerk, his father was a famous writer, and his mother was a new type of woman of the times, and avant-garde.In the memory of everyone, there is no longer a past life. Those unpleasant past events are only kept in Martin's memory. Of course, everything now is so GREAT for him.","

( I have since gone on to complete a BA Honours in Film Studies, and am just reigniting my passion for cinema).30 years later, and now that we have reached the milestone 2015 (the year Marty travels to the future in part two) this is still one of the most entertaining and well written movies of recent history. Everything fits perfectly into place from the script, camera-work and score, with memorable characters who each produce consistently great performances throughout the trilogy. Back to that opening sequence, a true example of fine film-making, this sequence inundates us with information and references, all vital to the plot, but at first glance, these visuals and sounds seem to be a random mix. The panning scene of the numerous clocks being an obvious reference to the major theme of ""time"", the newspaper clippings documenting the history of the Brown family, and the TV in the background, first advertising the Toyota pickup truck, the vehicle Marty pines for, and which becomes his eventual reward for fixing and rehabilitating his family through his actions in the film, to the news report of missing plutonium.You just have to look at how props, imagery and fashion from the movies have entered our own popular culture to see the impact this film has made on our generation. This ranges from the iconic Delorean Time Machine, the Nike Air Mag ""power laces"" trainers which Nike are due to release commercially, to the time old question we have all asked ourselves ""when are they finally going to invent hover boards?!"" Surely it can't be that hard!Apart from the afore mentioned , I believe one of the main reasons for the films continued success and impact, is the main concept of the film, that of time travel itself. Our desire to travel through time, the endless options of dates and locations, which I'm sure have sparked many debates amongst friends and family, along with, of course, the plausibility of time travel, and the mind bending science behind it - ""Time circuits on, flux capacitor....fluxing"".If I was to make once criticism of the film, it would be this. It is never really explained why a High School kid, Marty, spends so much time with an ageing ""mad scientist"", how they came to meet, and how they formed such a friendship. It could be understood if Marty was a shy, retiring ""nerd"", but his apparent popularity with women (note him waving to an entire aerobic class of women at the end of the first scene) make this friendship even stranger. But the on screen chemistry and comedic interaction between the characters is so great and genuine, that we accept this bizarre friendship for what it is, without asking further questions. In conclusion, how ever many times you watch this trilogy of films, you will never cease to be entertained, will probably notice something you didn't in a previous viewing, and will always want to ride a skateboard holding onto the back of a cop car.","

"robert-s-towner","13 August 2014","I have been re-watching this film for the past few decades and it never ceases to disappoint, proving to be a timeless classic. Is one of the few films that have tackled the impossibly complicated theme of time travel in an easy to understand manner.The BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy is also one of the few special set of three films that tie in perfectly together. They were not tacked on as a result of the first film achieving box-office success. Rather, they exist as perfectly complimentary films, vital for the complete story arc of each character to unfold.","

"luke-a-mcgowan","5 November 2015","Behold Robert Zemeckis' masterpiece, one of the best films ever to come out of the 1980s. One of the most brilliant and creative films I've ever seen, Back to the Future is an enduring classic.The star of the show is Marty McFly, played with utter brilliance by Michael J. Fox. Marty is a bit of a cool kid, but as played by Fox he's also a bit of a goof and he's hilarious to watch. In my opinion, McFly is the greatest movie protagonist of all time. He rattles off the incredible dialogue from Zemeckis and Bob Gale but also injects it with such authentic emphasis and ""ums"" and ""ahs"" that its so easy to watch without thinking that you are watching a performance. He has incredible chemistry with Doc Brown (the unparalleled Christopher Lloyd). Also making up the superb cast are Lea Thompson as Marty's mother, Crispin Glover as his father and Thomas F. Wilson as Biff (one of the greatest film bullies of all time, thanks to Wilson's intimidating yet incredibly funny performance).Alan Silvestri's iconic score is perfectly utilised to create a sense of triumph at key moments in the film. Zemeckis directs the hell out of the film with some superb long takes and superbly choreographed scenes. The film's climax is one of the most tense and brilliant scenes Zemeckis has ever made. But its the screenplay that makes the masterpiece - chock full of quotable dialogue, memorable characters and one of the most accessible time travel stories of all time. The story of Marty's parents is so much better now than I've ever realised; Lorraine's sheltered upbringing and George's timid persona set them up perfectly - their love story before Marty arrives is just as believable as their story as set by Marty, AND its just the right set of circumstances for his arrival to set it in jeopardy. It could have gone any way. Zemeckis and Gale place well written scenes in two different time periods to make a point more flawlessly than any amount of exposition ever could. There are some problems with the film - after George's triumphant victory in the car park, the film needs to put in one more obstacle for him to overcome (a red haired brat who is never seen before or after) which just feels like borrowing time (which was needed but could have been done better). But all you need to do is watch Michael J. Fox shred the guitar to Johnny Be Good and you'll be giving out a perfect rating just like I did.","

"The_Duderino87","24 May 2004","If you're looking for a movie that you can watch over and over and not get tired of it, this is it. Teenager Marty McFly comes from a weird family. His dad, George McFly, is a huge nerd who is always getting pushed around by his boss Biff Tannon. His mom is a controlling, hypocritical, burned out alcoholic. His brother is an air head that works at Burger King and his sister is doomed to the same fate as her mother so it seems. But Marty finds release in his lovely girlfriend Jennifer and his wacky scientist friend Dr. Emmit L. Brown. Marty dreams of making the big time with his band but is held back by the criticism of others, his fear of rejection, and the short comings of his family. But one day Doc Brown calls upon Marty to assist him in the testing of his newest invention, a DeLorean converted into a time machine. This movie is a fabulous adventure with good acting, special FX, and humor. The characters are very well written and very likable. This movie is brought to you by the first class director who is credited with Forrest Gump and Who Frammed Roger Rabbit. This is a true American classic movie that will be remember for many generations to come. If you haven't seen it, if you like good movies, buy it. Believe me it's worth it.","

Marty McFly and Doc are timeless characters that are supremely realized on screen by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Both of them are so animated and colorful with their deliveries throughout the runtime. The story is fresh and the writing is fun to the point that new viewers will be constantly asking themselves what's next. This is a film I can almost always sit down and enjoy, whether with family or even by myself. Despite its age, this movie continues to entertain.","

"axlrhodes","5 February 2011","Robert Zemeckis' Back To The Future is a highly entertaining, well imagined classic of a blockbuster. The 80's spawned a rich variety of franchise films and the Back To The Future series can be considered one of the better ones. Central to the success of the film are the performances, this is a science fiction blockbuster relatively light on special effects and more concerned with character and plot. All the actors are great, Lloyd and Fox of course,but praise must also go to Crispin Glover who plays his wet blanketed nerd with a heart role to perfection. The script is sharp and the production design is outstanding with a picture postcard image of the 1950's well realised and the Deloreon time machine a great touch. Zemeckis' last film Romance In The Stone proved how well he could handle entertaining popcorn movies and he succeeds beyond expectation here with a highly energised, fun packed time travelling adventure to remember.","

There wasn't a single moment where I felt tired or wanted to punch myself like in many other films. This is in my opinion, the greatest comedy film ever made not to mention one of the greatest Sci Fi films alongside T2, Matrix and the original Star Wars trilogy. The acting was superb, as was the music and the adventure itself.I absolutely found this movie hilarious with a superbly thought out plot and great execution. The dialogue was very funny and the film didn't stop me from laughing. I especially loved Dr Brown's characterFor me, I would highly recommend this film to anyone.

Fox) who meets this crackpot scientist Dr. Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd) who builds a time machine out of a DeLorean: America's Flop Car that'll remain memorable in this movie. Spoofed off H.G. Wells ""Time Machine"" ""BTTF"" is memorable all the way. Meeting your folks would be fun, but tampering with the past is not a game. Marty has to learn that hard. I liked the parts where he meets his father in the diner, and watch his future wife undress. Marty knew his father was a ""peeping tom"" when he was younger. Then trying to make a difference in their lives was the big part from keeping him and his siblings from non-existence was a bigger challenge. When everything was restored, Marty's finally changed for the better, though he introduced the skateboarding craze which one of the kids were amazed completely. Sticking to the dreams is important, listening to Dr. Brown is a must. Robert Zemeckis is a genius, and he really put up a solid cast and characters for the movie. The music rocks! I thought is was great, my mother digs Michael J. Fox! 5 stars!","

"papanloveu","29 July 2021","One of the Greatest Movies ever made. Easily the best Time-travel story. Bar none. The writing is rock-solid, the double-act of Michael J. Fox & Christopher Lloyd are the heart and soul of this story and the timeless and epic score of Alan Silvestri gives the movie so much heart that makes it feel larger in scale.This movie has something that modern Hollywood lacks - re-watch value. Very few movies today have performances that make you want to watch them again. I can say that Avengers: End Game is a great movie, but does it have the same re-watch value as Back to the Future? In my professional & personal opinion - no.The First Movie has not aged a day - it feels fresh and new every time you see it. I have lost count of how many times I've seen it over the years but I still laugh every time Biff gets ""the make like a tree"" line wrong and the penultimate Clock Tower scene is a still a pulse-racing experience to this day.Back to the Future is a Movie that will be talked about and enjoyed long after we're gone.It's timeless.","

"FiendishDramaturgy","22 January 2005","This is one of the few cult classics which deserves its status. It is a fun popcorn movie which does not take itself too seriously. A teenager-oriented flick, as was the norm of the 1980's, which holds fond memories for many of that era.It's become trendy to point out all the discrepancies in the science of this sci-fi/comedy, but they do not matter one bit to the casual movie goer, who will plug in this flick with a bowl of popcorn and lean back in that recliner for an hour and a half of good, wholesome family fun. And, frankly, they don't matter to me, either. This is not one of those sci-fi movies which demands that the science be put into the story in order for it to work. This works beautifully for the ~lack~ of the science. There is nothing to muddle the pace, mess with the timing of the comedic delivery, nor throw off the dramatic sequences.It is a very satisfying ""coming of age"" movie.All in all this is a very enjoyable and entertaining film which rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.","

"mmuggi","28 July 2020","This is the first time I see this classic, and although I'm not a fan of time travel movies, I have to say that this classic is a great example.The film is a time travel science fiction comedy with elements of family film. The film's cast is eminent, and although Michael J. Fox was busy due to his lead role in Family Ties, he plays amazingly in this film. This is even though he approximately only slept for a few hours each night for several months. Christopher Lloyd is just as brilliant as Dr. Emmett Brown and Crispin Glover, who otherwise at the time suffered an awful lot of stage fright, play wonderfully, though some of his scenes had to be changed in post where his dialogue had to be added.It was not originally Michael J. Fox who was to play Marty McFly, but instead Eric Stolz, who, however, brought a darker McFly to the table, something that Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale were not fans of. This resulted in quite a few reshoots, but thank goodness for that, as the end result is amazing.There are some special effects that are very dated, especially the iconic flames after the first demonstrative time travel, just as the film's release also required extreme precision, almost a tooth too much for it to be ""believable"".The film is funny and charming, and Pepsi must have earned the box office after the film became a classic. It has even been named the 56th best screenplay by the Writers Guild of America. It was also the first movie ever to feature a Delorean DMC-12.There were several ideas for the script of the film, which fortunately did not turn into anything.There are a few flaws, such as that the car never gets a scratch despite several collisions and the fact that Doc would never have been able to get into the car when it was standing in the truck, as the doors open vertically, and that one simply could not get a bulletproof vest that can protect against bullets from an AK-47. Doc should therefore be dead.However, the film has so much charm, humor and nostalgia about it that it ultimately ends up as a decided gem.","

"PetarNeo","7 October 2016","Movie pushed the limits of everything and just created an extremely good feeling and enjoyable to watch as Marty experiences a lot of trouble while being send to the past. Messing with things that happened he altered the future and was forced to keep doing everything so he could still be alive. Emmett is very funny with his unusual behavior and overall joy, also his excitement about everything and his troubles that he constantly experienced made him an very memorizing character. While messing with past after going back to the present and hoping to prevent killing of Dr., Marty found that some of scenes changed and Emmett was alive after shooting. Ending was probably most exciting thing in the whole movie as Marty found out that everything is changed and also when Emmett arrived back he took him back to future to prevent something that happened to their children. Music was fantastic with some of very popular songs. Movie is funny at many way but also creates this extraordinary situations that constantly need to be fixed. 4/4","

"Captain_Couth","5 February 2005","Back to the Future (1985) was the film that launched Michael J. Fox's career into the stratosphere. This film not only made him into an eighties superstar but it also made Back to the Future a part of Americana and a slight fixture upon Hollywood for a few years there after. This film was so successful that it was made into a trilogy.The film follows a high school student Marty Mc Fly (Michael J. Fox) who's not pleased with the way his life has been going. He always feels that there's more to his life than what there appears to be. When he's not spending time with his girlfriend or his band, Marty is best friends with an eccentric inventor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Doc Brown is on the verge of breaking through his latest discovery. Marty watches his family and notice's how broken down they are. But when he see's that the family car is wrecked he loses it. There goes his date! This dilemma isn't nothing compared to what Doc Brown has in store for him!This film is the perfect example of an eighties film. The fashion and style is in your face. Crispin Glover (who plays the Marty father) steals the show with his neurotic style of acting. He portrays Marty with an underlining manic presence. Michael J. Fox makes a somewhat believable teenager and Christopher Lloyd is great as Doc Brown (another character who's a borderline basket case), Eighties stars Lea Thompson, Casey Simezsko, Courtney Gaines and future star Billy Zane appear in this one as well.I happen to enjoy this film. The sequel was entertaining as well. But the final chapter was a weak effort by all. If you like Michael J. Fox or Cripsin Glover I advise you to check this flick out.Recommended.",NA
"qubit01","14 April 2013","This is one of the few movies my nerdy sci-fi self never cared about if the science was right or wrong, or about any plot inconsistencies or whatever, because it is just an incredibly fun movie from 00:01 to credits. I have seen this movie literally hundreds of times since I was a kid. I can tell you which clock in the opening sequence had the wrong time on it. I can tell you Doc Brown's address both in the past and the present. I know what kind of dog food Einstein eats. I know this movie better than ""Holy Grail"", and that's saying something. This one, part 3, and to a lesser extent part 2 are three of the best comedy/adventure/sci-fi/feelgood movies of all time, in my opinion. One simply cannot watch this movie and be disappointed.

"andrejvasiljevic","23 May 2010","I saw this movie 10 or maybe 15 years a go. Naturally I liked ""Back To The Future"" as every kid did. So, after a decade and a half last week I've decided to see it again, and man was it a cold shower.OK, let's be honest, Back To The Future films are meant to be a fictional comedy and you can't expect any complexity or dramatic twist. A cool kid with ambition and a classical nutty professor type join their forces in a time traveling adventure. Sounds like a cool plot for the 12-15 generation, but that's as far as it goes. I still find it entertaining yet the simpleness of the whole story does kill the excitement a bit. Also, the commercial aspect of the movies is insultingly obvious. Come on... Pepsi, Delorean, Nike, Toyota... it all shouts of sponsorship and it's placed without any effort of subtleness. It's like the whole budget was dependent on the good fortunes of the sponsors, thus making a movie into an expensive and long commercial. Overall, entertaining, relaxing but that's about it.And another thing. This is not SF!Science Fiction - Fiction based on scientific facts. Flux Capacitor and time traveling dogs are hardly supported by science. Very few films dubbed SF fulfill the standards overall. Adventure, fantasy, comedy, fiction... ""Back To The Future"" is all those things, but SF it ain't!",NA

"Fields201","26 October 2010","""Tell me, future boy! Who was President of the United States in 1985?"" And Marty quipped, ""Ronald Reagon."" ""Ronald Reagon? The actor? Who was vice president? Jerry Lewis?""Honestly, who doesn't love Back to the Future? I mean, seriously, who doesn't love Back to the Future? It's one of those rare movies that after you watch it, it just isn't enough, you have to watch it again. It's been 25 years later, generations had come and go, and even the new generation has fond memories of this remarkable movie.I think a lot of it is in its plot device and imagination. The imagination is so deep that it's almost plausible that you can travel through time with a little plutonium and a flux capacitor at a speed of 88 miles per hour. It could work! But part of the fun is its whimsical charm, and the humor laced into a sort of innocence and lightheartedness felt throughout the movie. The plot alone required some tongue and cheek humor as we find Marty mistakingly going back in time to 1955 - accidentally running into his parents in the process - and discovers that he made a crucial error of taking his dad's place and subjecting himself to his mom falling head over heels for him. Because of this, he created a time paradox that if he doesn't bring his parents together, he will cease to exist. Not only that, but he has only one chance to get back to the future, or be stuck in the past forever.As great as the plot (and especially the script) is, there is one vital importance to carry this film, and that is the performances. The Bobs made a wise decision casting Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly in just the way his mannerisms are, and how animated he is in his expressions. Just watch the scene in the beginning when Marty and Jennifer are outside Hill Valley, and Marty gets a hard on for that new truck. It's a scene that could bore you to tears but it was the writing and the performances that really put those finishing touches. To further demonstrate, just check out the scenes between Marty and Doc Brown (played brilliantly by Christopher Lloyd). Their chemistry together is like pancakes and syrup. Neither one of them steals a scene from each other, because they play off each other so well that they almost need each other to sell the scene.As a kid I was inspired to go skateboarding after that scene where Marty outsmarted Biff and his gang on the streets of Hill Valley. To this day, it is a classic scene. But as an adult, I appreciated the action in the ending because of the cinematography. It felt like a terrible night from hell, even if the sound effects are a little outdated. The way everything went wrong and Doc managing to fix the situation in the nick of time that zapped Marty back to 1985. It was all breathtaking stuff, and accompanied by a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri and the wonderful direction of Bob Zemeckis.I really can't give a high enough praise for this timeless film. Since 1985, a lot of the dialogue became catch phrases. ""Hello, McFly!"" was a common use of explaining someone was an idiot in my family. I think the world used that too. That might have explained Crispin Glover's lack of involvement for the sequels. I guess he wasn't fond of George McFly. Now that's heavy!",NA

Some of the metaphysical aspects of it may be a little off kilter to do with time casuality, past/present etc..  But that does not stop it from being immensely entertaining, and the basic idea and theories behind the concept of time travel are reasonably correct.

"CMTiago","15 August 2014","Sure one might argue that this movie does have some discrepancies in the time-line, still what makes most of us forget this, is the wonderful story being told on screen, which is why I believe many people, including myself, fell in love with this movie. Starring the newest star on the block back then, Back To The Future is a thrill ride that will surely entertain you, and for me part of the success of the film was due to wonderful dynamic acting by Michael J. Fox. When you add in Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson and many others who put up great supporting roles, as well as a delightful (despite its plot holes) script, then this a must-see movie.The movie's narrative focuses on a young boy named Marty McFly, who having traveled back in time to 1955, in his friend Doc Brown's time machine, has to fix his parents with each other in order to assure his existence. Factor in a comedic side to the story with his mom feeling attracted to him and a more dramatic side with Marty struggling to tell 1955 Doc that he dies in 1985, just before Marty traveled to 1955, and I would say the story is balanced. Just like Jurassic Park would put dinosaurs in the midst of popularity in 1993, I believe time traveling was a hot topic among those who watched and enjoyed the movie in 1985. It's that kind of reaction that I think creates a classic movie.It might not be the most perfect film, however Back To The Future is blockbuster royalty and an audience favorite. It pleases with its light comedy and might even cause a few tears here and there. Bottom line: I don't think I'll ever stop loving this movie.Rating: 10/10",NA
