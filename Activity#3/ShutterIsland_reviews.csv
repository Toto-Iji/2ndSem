"classicsoncall","30 August 2010","There are a number of films I've seen more than once, and if they're good (the only reason really, to watch them again), they become a richer experience and one gains a greater appreciation of them. ""Shutter Island"" might be the only picture that on subsequent viewings, becomes a DIFFERENT film from the one originally seen. I say this because the first time around, there's no way to take the character of Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) other than at face value. He's a detective investigating a missing person case on an island. Not your normal island, but one that's home to an institution for the criminally insane. Every interaction he has with a character in the picture is one between himself, Detective Daniels, and that character. As we come to learn, all that changes when Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) reveals the twist near the end of the story, at which point, one is left either totally disillusioned or utterly blown away.What's unique and brilliant about the writing here is evident upon a second viewing. What we now know to be true about Teddy Daniels becomes even more evident. We're able to understand that in Teddy's first meeting with Naehring (Max von Sydow), Naehring is actually speaking to Laeddis. Yet those references to Laeddis/Daniels' 'defense mechanisms' could have been offered and taken either way. George Noyce (Jackie Earle Haley) was speaking to Laeddis as he had no reason not to. The vision of Rachel Solando in the cave was warning Teddy that he had no friends, and that there was no way off the island. This was a way for the viewer to understand that in some small way, Teddy/Laeddis was conversing with himself, sometimes with clarity and other times delusionally. The Warden (Ted Levine) is clearly speaking directly to Laeddis when he picks up Teddy after his night in the cave. This is all so masterfully done that even watching the picture multiple times, it's amazing to pick up on the nuance that went into developing the story.Now I have to admit, the first time I saw the picture and it became apparent that Teddy Daniels was Laeddis, I wanted to blow it off as one of those cheap constructs that film makers are prone to indulge in just to play with the viewer's head. But somehow, this was different. This was a study, a grand two day experiment if you will, designed to force Laeddis to come to terms with himself and what he had done to become confined to an institution. The way the whole story evolves is fascinating to watch, almost like watching the making of the movie instead of the movie itself. I've seen ""Shutter Island"" three times now in the space of about a month, and I know with certainty that I'll be watching it again. There's not many films I can say that about, but this one just begs it, almost like a patient requiring your uninterrupted attention.","

"jackgdemoss","22 July 2019","I originally saw this film when it came out but couldn't remember it well enough to give it a rating or write a review, so a rewatch was in order. I viewed the film through the lens of already knowing the plot twist, which made it a whole different experience. The ending will be remembered throughout film history as one that showed just how viciously a well written script can flip an audience over. This really is a film you should see twice.","

"napierslogs","22 May 2010","Martin Scorsese has done it again. He pays attention to every detail in this film, making ""Shutter Island"" one of the best suspense thrillers of all time.Visually intriguing, simplistic and absolutely phenomenal. The story is kept simplistic enough so it doesn't get absurd, but allows for an ending which you probably won't see coming. The film doesn't go for cheap thrills, so although you will be on the edge of your seat you won't get needlessly scared.The film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to detailed laid-out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely engross you in the film. I loved every minute of it and highly recommend it to everyone. Even if you're not a usual fan of the genre, this film has so much more to it.","

"ruhsa","24 September 2017","Shutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshal sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy's wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don't think this film would be the same without them.This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else's shoes entirely during the second viewing.Shutter Island. A film that will make you question your own sanity. A film that will leave you breathless. A film that has re-ignited the thriller genre. A film that will leave you, and the main character, searching for answers.","

"NpMoviez","29 July 2018","It is one of the best movies made by director Martin Scorsese. It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Honestly speaking, it is one of the greatest films of the decade. DiCaprio featured in two movies in 2010, the other one being ""Inception"". Both were excellent. To this day, they are some of the best cinematic experience I have ever had. That being said, I found ""Shutter Island"" to be much more superior, as ""Inception"" feels a little bit of a mumbo jumbo many times.Good.
""Shutter Island"" is simply a masterpiece. The beginning of the movie suggests a very basic plot of a detective story, possibly a thriller. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes bigger and bigger with more and more complexity added to it. The way this happens is incredible. The pacing is really good. That is what makes the movie so interesting. And, even though the movie gets more complex, it is not difficult to keep up with the major plot points. And, the final twist is one of the best plot twists I have ever seen. I did not expect it at all. And, like the main character portrayed by DiCaprio, we are not ready to believe what is being told until a lot of reveals finally convince us. There are a lot of many things that might seem to be pointless before the final twist which are totally relevant with the story that is actually being told. The character of Edward Daniels is superbly written. We get to know where the character is coming from and we can get behind the character - yet another excellent thing about this movie. There are some dream sequences that seems like a filler, but is a major indication to the reveal. There are quite many ""illusions"" which feel very real, but carry no real meaning in the end. There are many additional things which may seem like a diversion from the story being told, but are actually enhancing it. Some dialogues between the main character and an imprisoned character get a very different interpretation after it's all set and done. So much of a complex story, yet no giant inconsistencies at all. It's just superbly written and directed and acted. It's totally different from ""Memento"" (2000) but still, has a lot of similarities. We get into the main character's head and we just get his interpretations, different types though. Towards the end, we don't want to step fully outside his head, but when we finally do, it's mind blowing. The ending moments were conceived by many to be confusing. But, if you keep up with the entire story, it's meaning is quite obvious. The movie is dark and psychologically engrossing. Yet it does have a short lived and very brief happy moment with the tiny plotline involving Dr. Cawley's motives. That's all I can say without getting into complete spoilers. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsly have given some of the great performances till date. I don't have anything that bugged me. So no mixed or bad aspects of the film.Conclusion.
On the whole, for me, it's the movie of the decade. The decade is almost over, and still I have not got any movie in the league of ""Shutter Island"". It's a very engaging and thrilling movie. It's one of those films I consider to be an all time great.Rating.

"Tania_Chesala_R","27 February 2010","I know there is already a spoiler warning up top but I am going to warn you again. Don't read this because I am going to give everything away.I had this movie all wrong I will admit at the start I didn't get it and I was angry but after having a chat with my friend who went with me we both gasped when we realised what happened. The twist wasn't that he was the inpatient (seriously I think everyone saw that coming from a mile away!) the twist was the intervention actually worked. He was cured, he deliberately made it look like he relapsed because he did not want to live with the memory of what happened to his family. He blamed himself for ignoring that his wife was clearly unstable. The line ""would you rather die as a good man or live as a monster"" Depicted he wanted to die as a good man (lobotomized) then live with the memory of what happened. Also the symbolism of fire and water tells you when he is hallucinating (fire) and when he is lucid (water trickling through.) The delusion he concocts to save himself from accepting the truth is that his wife died in a fire. All the people he talks to surrounded by fire is a hallucination – the woman in the cave, the patient in the cell, the scarred faced man who he thinks killed his wife, the car blowing up – all a delusion. The water symbolizes reality trying to break through. He is afraid of water – ( and rightly so!His kids were drowned, they all died in front of the lake.) Also at the start he says he gets 'sea sick' – he is mortally afraid of water. He has to swim to get to the lighthouse.To truly get the best affect of this movie you have to see it more than once. (I have only seen this once but I promise you I will see it again)I think John Anderson from the Wall Street Journal got it right when he says the film - ""requires multiple viewings to be fully realized as a work of art. Its process is more important than its story, its structure more important than the almost perfunctory plot twists it perpetrates. It's a thriller, a crime story and a tortured psychological parable about collective guilt.""","

"planktonrules","8 July 2011","2010 was very good to Leonardo DiCaprio. Shedding his pretty little boy image, he played in two very gritty and similar films, ""Shutter Island"" and ""Inception"". I saw them both and enjoyed them both. And, to buck the tide, I'd have to say I actually liked ""Shutter Island"" a little more...really. Now do NOT just rush out to rent this one, as I can't see this film appealing to everyone. It IS confusing. The plot can feel a bit tiresome and slow. But, if you are very patient, it all comes together perfectly--with the last 15 minutes totally enthralling me. I think part of it is because I am a retired psychotherapist and psychology teacher--and the film is a great psychological drama. And, the story actually is consistent psychologically and is actually plausible.Now I could recap the plot, but currently there are something like a bazillion reviews on IMDb for this film. Instead, let's talk about what I liked. First and foremost, the writing was simply great--very intelligent and well-crafted. It really makes you think and doesn't underestimate the audience's intelligence. Second, the acting is really good. DiCaprio was excellent, but having Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow REALLY made this a wonderful picture. Watch this one...it's currently on premium cable. And, it's also a film that bear re-watching as there are many layers to the film you won't notice the first time.","

"davidmvining","29 March 2021","This movie's ending is a case study in how to read movies. If you consider what was said before, what was done before, and the basics of the character's journey, there is literally only one way to read the movie's final moments. Everything up to that moment builds to the finale is designed to feed a specific end point, and it helps the movie as a whole that everything up to that point is incredibly well done. Scorsese had one early foray into big budget filmmaking with New York, New York, which wasn't really any kind of success, but his turn into big budget filmmaking with another two decades of experience under his belt has been far more successful as he is able to still coax quality performances from his actors while working with more traditionally narrative based scripts (this time based on a novel by Dennis Lehane) and much more intricate and larger production design.Off the coast of Massachusetts lays Shutter Island, an old Civil War fort that has been repurposed into a mental hospital for the criminally insane. A mystery pops up when one of their patients has disappeared from her cell and two US Marshals arrive on the ferry. These are Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). The movie begins with ominous tones from the soundtrack as the ferry emerges from the fog, and Teddy is having trouble with sea sickness. Getting on the island, everything feels off from the get go. The guards are watching them too closely. They're required to give up their firearms. They're not allowed to see any of the hospital personnel files. There's a German doctor of high position less than a decade after the end of World War II. The guards don't even seem interested in looking for the lost patient. Patients and personnel all seem coached and artificial, and behind it all is Dr. Cawley (Ben Kinglsey).Nothing about the story of Rachel Solando disappearing from her cell makes any sense, up to and including the need to send for US Marshals and to hamstring them from any kind of real investigation at the same time. How could she have gotten by so many orderlies? How could she vanish for so long without her shoes? How could she wander the grounds without shoes at all considering the rough terrain of the island? The staff, in particular Dr. Cawley, are obviously hiding something from Teddy, and Teddy's going to figure it out.He and Chuck are not long term partners, Chuck having met Teddy for the first time on the boat, so Teddy tells Chuck his real reason for taking the case. He's heard things about Shutter Island, stemming from stories he's heard about the man who lit the fire in the apartment building he was living in that killed his wife. He's there, but there have also been tales of sick experiments being run on the patients, particularly in Ward C built from the actual fort while the rest of the hospital was made of the troops' barracks. Teddy's going to get to the bottom of this and blow the whole thing up to the world.It's a paranoia infested plot that involves anti-communist agents, young and innocent socialists, and a power mad doctor, and it's all in Teddy's mind.The main strength of this movie really is Teddy's descent into madness and how it's masked for so long as a him getting closer to the truth. That manifests in particular through memories and dreams. Teddy was a soldier in World War II and helped liberate Dachau, and he's consumed by the memory of the commandant killing himself poorly and dying in a pool of his own blood as well as the piles of bodies in the ice and snow and his part in the quick execution of the SS guards. He also has dreams of his departed wife in their apartment. There's a mysterious presence of water, and her back is hollowed out and ashy from fire as she crumbles in his arms.As the story progresses and Teddy becomes convinced that Dr. Cawley is feeding him drugs in the food, water, and even cigarettes, the visions become more pronounced in his waking life. His wife and a little girl appear before him, and he talks to them directly without anyone else seeing them. However, because the movie is told really strictly from Teddy's point of view we don't have any other information until later that the exact opposite is happening, that he's in withdrawal from the drugs that he had been on before a couple of days before.The reveal at the end in the much talked about lighthouse is a gut punch. The true nature of Teddy's sickness, the true history of his wife and how she died, it's all inexorably tied to what we've seen before, and the audience wants to reject that reality as much as Teddy does. It's horrible what Teddy went through, and his insistence on living in a fantasy world of Nazi experiments suddenly makes so much more sense.Now, the reading of the ending. There's really only one interpretation of Teddy's final choice. If we have all this talk of running from the past, of having a choice of becoming a monster or staying a good man, what possible explanation could there be other than Teddy is completely self-aware when he says the fateful words that lead to the final surgery? If not, then the rest of the movie was just a series of random events that don't mean anything, but if those events do mean something then the ending means that Teddy is making his choice in full command of his facilities. He's faced with the truth of his actions, of his past, and of his wife, and he can't take it. He can either descend back into madness or he can remove himself from that completely, and he chooses removal.This is such a natural follow up to The Departed for Scorsese. Both are about identity, about making choices of who we are, but Shutter Island is firmly within the psychological horror genre while The Departed was a crime movie. There's so much to chew on for the audience on these questions of who we choose to be based on what came before us.On top of all that, this movie is gorgeous to simply look at. Up until this point, this is Scorsese's best looking movie (Silence, I think, ends up even prettier). The deep blues and greens of the island, the storm, and the dark corridors of Ward C along with the bright red of the old barracks all provide this wonderfully rich color palette that is wonderfully pleasing to the eye. Lensed by Robert Richardson who had worked with Scorsese on Bringing Out the Dead and The Aviator (where color had been rather precisely designed to recreate color photography from different eras of Hollywood's history), the movie just looks fantastic.DiCaprio gives a very good performance as Teddy, steadily losing his mind as he goes deeper into the mysteries of the island. Ben Kinglsey balances right between professional, menacing, and caring in ways that make perfect sense within their contexts but add up to a man frustrated in his quest to help a sick man. Michelle Williams is wounded and also rather terrifying as Teddy's wife, Dolores. There are very small parts from Elias Koteas as Andrew Laeddis, the man Teddy's trying to find, and by Jackie Earle Haley as George Noyce, a patient who'd received a beating. I suppose the only weak link is Mark Ruffalo as Chuck. He's fine as the clueless US Marshal in over his head early, but he feels kind of empty late in the film when his true nature appears.Still, this movie is great, and it's one of Scorsese's best. Intelligently written by Laeta Kalogridis, beautifully photographed by Robert Richardson, and scored by a variety of classical music arranged by long-time Scorsese collaborator Robbie Richardson of The Band, Scorsese's Shutter Island shows the advantages of a master of the craft given a large budget to fully tell a story that appeals to him.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","4 November 2023","US Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule travel to an asylum on a remote island, aiming to discover a missing patient, there they discover some very strange goings on there.Shutter Island is probably in my top twenty films of all time, when I first saw it I didn't fully understand it, since then I've studied all sorts of theories, and tried to put the pieces together.You may need to watch it for a second time, as some of the pieces mah not fall into place, but when they do..... The twist was brilliant, I didn't see it coming first time round.Gripping, imaginative, clever, twisted, engrossing, I could go on, it's a wonderful movie, one that really does make you think, as an attentive viewer you will be hugely rewarded.I don't know why, but to me it's never felt like a Martin Scorsese film, maybe it's the tone or the actual story itself, but it's just so unlike any of this other works.Scorsese always knows how to get the best our of Di Caprio, and once again he delivers, it's a quite brilliant performance.10/10.","

"dvc5159","16 April 2010","Finally, a horror/thriller that actually, genuinely scares the crap out of you. Not because it has fancy villains in masks or sadistic buckets of gore throughout. No, it scares you because it messes with your mind. Most will hate this movie, they don't like their brains being tampered with. I loved it. It's what we needed after all those gory R-rated and sometimes lame-duck PG-13 horror crap-fests.The horror/thriller genre has been raped lately, with gore and scantily clad- women replacing the noir and terror that Alfred Hitchcock perfected in the '50s and '60's. Here director Martin Scorsese delivers in full blast, crafting a thriller in his own unique vision. The atmosphere throughout the movie is tense and unsettling. Slow as it may be, but it is crucial to the movie and it's genuinely gripping. Your attention WILL not be lost. The scenery is beautiful and finely done with no excessive lighting, grain or darkness. The editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is fluid and pitch-perfect, and never makes the film lose focus. The movie is based on a book by Dennis Lehane and is packed with twists and turns that will leave you breathless and uneasy. The movie cranks the breathlessness and uneasiness up to the power of 5. The music is also perfectly suited with the scenes. There is sometimes no music during suspenseful moments, and sometimes the music makes the scene even more disturbing and memorable. Alfred Hitchcock's noirish thriller style is back with a vengeance, here to teach today's moviegoers the REAL meaning of suspense and horror.All the actors in the movie are in top-form. Once again, you can't go wrong with a Leonardo DiCaprio/Martin Scorsese collaboration. As the protagonist, we the audience are thrust into his shoes and we are about as confused and scared as his character is, we feel what he feels. It becomes a psychological trip that poses many, many questions about oneself, that to discuss them here would spoil the entire movie. There are some flashbacks in the movie, but all of them are important clues to DiCaprio's character. DiCaprio gives a stunning performance, once again tempting the Academy to give him another Best Actor nomination. DiCaprio gives a vivid portrayal of a vulnerable, haunted and ultimately terrified man. Apart from DiCaprio there's really not much I can say about the supporting cast, because they are all also terrific. Ben Kingsley; Mark Ruffalo; Michelle Williams; Max Von Sydow; Jackie Earle Haley; Emily Mortimer; Patricia Clarkson; Ted Levine; Elias Koteas; John Carroll Lynch. All of them.In short, this is a psychological and frightening masterpiece that will make you scared, will make you think, and will make you seek psychological help. This is one of the best films of the year. See it, go in with an open mind and prepare to be blown away.Overall value: 9/10.","

"TheDeadMayTasteBad","23 February 2010","There is one line of dialogue, right at the end of Shutter Island before the credits roll, that elevates the emotion of the film and makes it much more powerful. For those of you, like me, who read and enjoyed the novel before seeing the film and felt that the trailers and advertisements for this film were leading you to believe there wouldn't be any narrative surprises in store, think again! Scorsese's film features that one brief piece of dialogue at the films conclusion that results in an entirely different perception of the final act. The rest of the film, however, is very faithful to Dennis Lehane's already great story.Shutter Island represents exactly what one should hope for when seeing a novel being interpreted to film. While it certainly does the source material justice, it also adds small changes that make for a distinctive experience. Even if you've read the novel multiple times, you'll feel like you're reading the book for the first time again while watching. Scorsese perfectly recreates the menacing atmosphere of the island on film. Every location is foreboding and drenched with hints of unseen danger in dark corners. The lighthouse, the caves, the civil war fort housing ""the most dangerous patients,"" and the island itself--every locale seems large yet claustrophobic and isolated at the same time.I often experience claustrophobia myself and there are certain films that really capitalize on that personal fear and make it more relevant and eerie to me. Neil Marshall's The Descent was one such picture, and this is another. An confined island is a terrific horror location and it comes with its own type of fear. The utter desperation to escape from a persistent and confined nightmare is something Teddy (Dicaprio) is receiving in high doses, and so does the audience.As with Scorsese and DiCaprio's previous collaborations, this is a movie that must be seen. Here they explore the horror/thriller genre with gravitas, with no small part played by Laeta Kalogridis in supplying the screenplay. While most modern pictures of its kind lack character or any real sense of suspense, Shutter Island doesn't go for cheap gags. I concur with Ebert when he says one of the key elements to this film is that it releases its tension through suspense instead of mindless action sequences. That's not to knock a well-deserved frenetic scene of violence every once in awhile--it works to the advantage of some films like Evil Dead II and Planet Terror--but had Teddy and Chuck gone running and gunning through the facility's faculty, the mood this movie keeps in check so well would have been lost.However, that mood isn't sacrificed and ""spooky"" is punched up to full force. A considerable amount of that spooky is generated by a ""best of"" collection of actors that have mastered the art of creepy: Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, and Max Von Sydow just to name a few. Had Tom Noonan been thrown in the cast as well, my ""Top Five People I Would Not Want to Be Left in the Dark with, Especially in a Room with No Doors or Windows"" list would have been completely exhausted. On that note, is it just me or has Sydow mysteriously not aged since The Exorcist? Was there a secret pact made between Lucifer and Father Merrin? Whether he sold his soul or not, he's quite ominous in every single scene he is present in. All of this great talent in front of the camera doesn't mean anything though if you don't have a faithful orchestrator behind it. Luckily you have Scorsese leading the lens and he points the movie in the right direction, even if this isn't among his very best works. His style works amazingly with suspense laden projects and at times he even seems to channel Hitchcock and Kubrick, though there's always something distinctively Scorsese about the presentation. I found the editing in the opening scene, with Chuck and Teddy approaching Shutter Island, to be very odd and frantic, though I think the audience will know why Scorsese displayed the scene the way he did after completing the film.With a body of work so impressive, Shutter Island is among captivating company. The good news is that Shutter Island carves out a place of its own in his resume. While no Goodfellas or Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, I have no problem placing Shutter side by side The Last Temptation of Christ and Bringing Out the Dead. The cinematography is bright and gorgeous. Scorsese doesn't rely on the over-grainy, ugly presentation that most modern horror or suspense-riddled thrillers rely on. He uses lush, bright color during daytime and dream sequences to flush out a distinct feeling of terror.Shutter Island isn't just a pretty face, its also got a great story to boot and this is why I've been anticipating the film for so long. As mentioned earlier, I've been exposed and digested the source material myself before seeing the movie. I was worried the trailers for the film were giving away too much through their spots on television and on the silver screen, but Scorsese has added enough to the film for the story to feel fresh even for those ""in the know."" You are transferred in the films paranoia and phobia once the camera pans through the mental facilities open doors. Lehane is one of the luckiest authors on the planet to have his work adapted to the big screen by talents such as Eastwood and Scorsese, but his work is brilliant and deserving of such treatment.At the risk of spoiling plot points for potential viewers who have not read the book, I'll leave a Related Recommendations section concealed in ""Spoiler"" tags. Discussing this story at any length can be quite revealing.","

"stednitzrules250","21 February 2010","Shutter Island. A film that will divide the film community. A film that will leave many upset, and hating it. A film that has already completely split the critics. A movie that messes with you. And no one likes to be messed with. And that is exactly where it exceeds. Think I'm contradicting myself? Shutter Island is one of the most well crafted psychological thrillers to come by since Silence Of The Lambs. And it is no coincidence both were brilliantly written novels. Shutter Island is adapted by a book written by Dennis Lehane (wrote gone baby, gone and mystic river). It is a book filled with twists and turns, that will leave the reader dizzy. And, that is what it's film counterpart does to the fullest. Martin Scorsese helms the director chair, in a movie where he is more free than any before. This is Scorsese at his most unrestrained. Marty takes what he has learned from the great films of the past and puts it into his. The master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock's influence is everywhere you look in this film. And it is no wonder, considering Scorsese even showed one of his greatest works to the crew: Vertigo. And many of those ideas are present in Shutter Island; the cliff scenes scream Hitchcock. This is a film that creeps and crawls, and is filled with dark corners. And it is all heightened by the coming storm that looms over the island. This is classic film noir. The story follows Teddy, a federal Marshall, and his partner Chuck (Played by DiCaprio and Ruffulo). They go to this mysterious island enveloped in fog to investigate an escape. From these opening scenes, Marty has set up a dark and creepy premise. Almost the whole movie incorporates this story as Teddy desperately tries to find the truths he seeks. Teddy is shown as a scared man; a man of war and violence as portrayed in various flashbacks. These will go on to be increasingly important as the story progresses. We follow Teddy on his quest, through every dark corridor and perilous confrontations. Slowly, we are given pieces to the puzzle, but the audience does not even realize it. For we, like Teddy, are blind. For the moment at least. It is because of this that the thrilling conclusion will leave many blindsided. But, you see, that is where this thriller becomes something more. We as the audience are put in Teddy's shoes, and we feel all the things he feels. It is a complete assault on the senses, and it works beautifully. This is a film you must watch carefully. That is another thing that sets this apart, it is a horror film that makes you actually think. In this day and age, I'm not surprised some found it terrible esp. after their brains have been turned to mush by these new gore filled horror films. Scorsese's ultimate goal here is to wake you up. And trust me, you probably wont like it. This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else's shoes entirely during the second viewing. Shutter Island. A film that will make you question your own sanity. A film that will leave you breathless. A film that has re-ignited the thriller genre. A film that will leave you, and the main character, searching for answers. 10 out of 10 -CLS","

Two Marshalls make the trip, investigate, when an inmate disappears from the estate, vanishing, into thin air, no one knows quite how or where, then a storm arrives, events then bifurcate.Wonderful performances all round in a tale that may leave more questions than answers at the end as it twists and turns, writhes and squirms, revealing an iceberg of a story that has a lot more going on beneath the surface than you originally anticipated.","

"TheLittleSongbird","6 August 2010","I like Martin Scorsesse a lot, and I was interested in seeing Shutter Island. It had a truly intriguing concept and my 17-year old sister was raving about how brilliant the film was. Shutter Island is not Scorsesse's best, but it was atmospheric, clever, incredibly thought-provoking and somewhat disturbing too.I do agree it is too long and that it drags in places, that Shutter Island is still very impressive and gripping. The cinematography is great, dark, expressionistic and Gothic. Same with the scenery which is both picturesque and bleak, while the direction is superb, almost operatic and imaginative. The screenplay is intelligent and the plot gripping and clever, however Shutter Island is one of those films that if you miss a line of dialogue or a plot point you are in danger of missing something important. I also liked the music- admittedly the repeated bass motif which has a knock-on-the-door effect makes us think immediately that something out of the ordinary is going to happen but I have to admit it was haunting, while the Mahler chamber music piece along with the more gut-wrenching images at Dacchau was put to effective use, though coming from a classical music enthusiast I never knew Mahler wrote chamber music.The acting is very good, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are both excellent, and Mark Ruffalo was surprisingly good too. Max Von Sydow is also good, and although I wasn't sure about Michelle Williams at first she was suitably eerie and haunting. Finally the ending, some have said it was clever, others were underwhelmed by it. For me, I found it very clever and it was actually the part of the film that made me think about most. Of course it leaves questions rather than answers, but I think that was the point, it is ambiguous and open to interpretation and I certainly would have never thought of that. There could also be the possibility that there is no right or wrong answer, we are left to wonder for ourselves whether he was sane or not, and I think that was a reason for why the film ended inconclusively- I for one asked myself what did happen to Ted? Overall, very gripping and clever, with an ending that really makes you think. It is not what I consider a perfect film, but the direction and acting makes up for any misgivings. Plus it is probably a film you need to see more than once to completely understand or appreciate it. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"Hitchcoc","30 August 2010","I was told on several occasions to skip this film. While I felt it took a long way to get to the point, I found it intriguing and engaging. I've really grown to like DeCaprio and find him to be an interesting actor. One reviewer did criticize him for hanging around the dark side a bit much, but that could be said about Nicholson and a host of others. This is one of those mind puzzles that force one to guess a good deal. Because of the pace, I eventually figured it out. Nevertheless, it is told in a very interesting way. With ""Inception"" capturing the box office recently, this seems a mild effort to explore the subconscious. It is multi-layered and complex. It throws curves and red herrings, but I never felt toyed with. This is certainly worth a shot.","

"Ch4ndler_B1ng","9 March 2020","68% on Rotten Tomatoes, really?This movie has multiple meanings but at times it is hard to explain the meaning because you can't find the words to describe it. So I'm going to try and keep it easy to understand.At the beginning we see our main character, Teddy Daniels a.k.a. Andrew Laeddis (as we find out towards the end) throwing up on a ferry saying it's because he is seasick, but now I get it. He is throwing up because he so horrified by his past, his wife killing his three children by drowning them and him shooting her in the stomach that he gets sick every now and then. Ben Kingsley's character says that Dr Sheehan is overseas, which we find out is actually Andrew's psychiatrist for Shutter Island. His disguise name is Chuck Aule and he tries to play the part as Daniel's buddy in this new situation.Close to the introduction of the film, we see the cops handling rifles when Daniels gets out from the ferry, this is because he is a dangerous patient and we have no idea when he is just going to get mad and kill somebody. He has had a short temper ever since the death of his wife and his three children. When you first watch the movie, you don't realise why the cops could be handling the rifles when Teddy is around, that is the genius of Scorsese. Second time around, you notice something odd about the way people act around Andrew, they're scared of him, they try to act civil around him but the freak out!The one scene where Teddy and Chuck are interviewing patients and he comes across that one female that seems fine, he asks her, ""Have you ever seen a patient called Andrew Laeddis?"" she answers back, frightened, ""Nope, never heard of him"" and runs out crying, that is because she is legitimately afraid of him.And if you pay real close attention the name that Teddy gives his wife, Rachael Solando and the detective name he gives himself Teddy Daniels spells out the real names of the two.

"Irishchatter","29 December 2015","I thought this film was fantastic, i wouldn't call it scary or easily frightening, I would call it a mystery thriller masterpiece. As usual with Leonardo DiCapro, he was always excellent at playing the right roles. Gee, he had to play two characters - Ted and Andrew which could make you confused to which one is he really acting as. That must be really challenging but i say Leonardo is well able to do any role at the same time!I liked the fact this was based on a mental asylum on an island because it just gives you the curious feeling of what will happen next. You really don't to skip a minute or two to not see the full movie since you just gotta find out what really is going on. Although be warned, you will just get one jump-scare. Its the scene where Andrew shot his wife after she killed their three children and you wouldn't have expected it since it was so fast!This is a really great masterpiece of DiCapro's work, I give this movie 9/10 :)","

"talkymeat","14 May 2010","Shutter Island centers around two U.S. Marshalls who must search for a missing patient on said island, which has a large complex specifically designed for harboring the most violent and disturbed mental patients. Agent Teddy Daniels and his partner must try to understand the mysteries of Shutter Island while attempting to unearth a plot that may go all the way up to the men who run it.Shutter Island is a very unique and interesting movie. The acting, directing, and the script are all excellent as can be expected in a Scorsese movie. But the quality that sets this apart from most of his previous works is the tone and genre. Scorsese does an amazing job of creating a haunting and dark tone that fits such a suspenseful movie very well.The twist is also very good, even though it was given away by the trailers. At the end of the movie it is revealed that Leonardo DiCaprio is a patient on Shutter Island and everything that has happened has been an attempt to allow him to live out his delusion of a missing patient and two U.S. Marshalls investigating a secret plot. This idea is a bit far fetched, but that is easily forgivable when you consider how well it was interwoven into the plot.Upon watching it a second time I noticed all the subtle hints that were placed throughout the movie. That is another quality of Shutter Island that I admire; it's re-watchability. After you know what Leonardo DiCaprio is, it makes the second viewing an entirely different and highly enjoyable experience. You can find all the things you missed the first time and understand all the things that seemed vague and confusing when you didn't know where it was going. The only real gripe I have would be that Scorsese never really captures true emotion here. The scenes that are supposed to resonate don't really pull you in like they should, specifically the scene by the lake with his wife and kids. Not to say that you don't care about the characters just that it misses the mark somewhat in the drama department. Shutter Island is a very underrated movie and ranks with some of Scorsese's best. His trip into suspense/mystery actually works very well and he captures a tone that I've never seen before. Somewhere between horror and suspense he finds a gray area that gives Shutter Island a feeling all it's own. Certainly worth watching and re-watching again and again.","

"slothhead54","17 February 2010","I just saw Shutter Island this evening, just prior to its American release. I have to say this film was full of intrigue. Prior to viewing this film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller was going to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing when watching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your average film-goer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thought required. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically and definitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone who was never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so much range to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film is excellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. I always enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film and where the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer.","

"bain0038","19 February 2010","From the look of the trailer, Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" looks more like a horror film This is a dangerous place where isolation rules under fascist control. A U.S Marshall is sent to an asylum to investigate a missing patient but discovers so much more. A demon? A ghost? Something more? Is this going to be as disappointing as I think it is?I was skeptical walking into the theater, wondering if this twist could hold water. The film starts with Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, standing on a ferry. They talk about their assignment. What's suspect here is that there is no additional development. We are bam, smack right into the story without so much as an opening montage. All that we see is the men smoking a couple cigarettes. Though this is what begins as momentous development. As our hero smokes we that this isn't the glorified top lit smoking of a beauty or that of a sophisticated and confident gangster. We see that this is a harsher character with poor posture, someone who doesn't sleep well, someone with a deep pastThey are greeted at the gate by guards whose attitudes' seem immediately suspect. Soon we meet Dr Crawley, a seemingly complex and modern man who runs the asylum. However, he soon turns uncooperative with the investigation. Inmates and staff are hiding something but what? Everyone here seems off. Evidence and clues begin to appear but not before our hero seems riddled by psychosis himself. ""You act like all this madness is contagious."" Daniels says to the guard. Is it? Soon we begin to wonder, too, but not before he uncovers the tip of the iceberg and it's not only painfully intimate with his own past but also a mass conspiracy. The Nazis had concentration camps and the Americans have Shutter Island.Though, it doesn't stop here, but to say anything else would do the story injustice Kingsley is in his finest role in years. Similarly, DiCaprio reaches new levels. Amongst others Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Michelle Williams, all play small but wonderful roles. Robert Richardson captures a world all of its own.While Scorsese is a master of film I'd say that his specialty has been more character than story. This is a fresh balance of both. It's a mix of noir and thriller. It's only sort of a horror movie and could be compared to ""The Shining"" but it makes it look like it's a one trick pony. All this praise being said it's not for everyone. The story is complex. It takes some attention. At times it's a bit bleak and dire. Of course it all makes a little less sense when you actually think about it but then again that's film. There are a couple of moments where the story gets lost within itself. Things become a bit too complicated. At this point you might begin to lose faith in its viscosity, but don't worry because the story has you right where its put you.","

"IamtheRegalTreatment","19 February 2010","Similar to my rating for this film, you can argue that 9 out of 10 people who watch this movie, it will not be their first Scorsese film. Most of us know the genius that he is and coming into this showing we should expect brilliance, and gladly he delivers a captivating storyline driven by great acting. Unfortunately with the release of Shutter Island was also a press release that Taxi Driver may be remade, so that news made me hesitant to care, but I'm glad I was wrong.Shutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshall sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy's wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don't think this film would be the same without them.Even to begin explaining details of the plot and how everything comes to fruition causes me to feel migraines alike the ones Teddy gets in the movie, therefore I won't ruin anything for you now. Take my honest word that if you enjoyed any Scorsese movie in the past or have enjoyed movies that include surrealism, Shutter Island combines the two into an intense thriller that boggles the mind and possibly even ""corrode it, rusts it"". Also, if you are hesitant to watch this film because the trailer perceives it as a horror film with a lot of ""jumpy"" scenes, ignore that. I had the same feeling entering it, and there was only one towards the very end, but it was worth the shock. You will miss so much detail trying to cover your eyes for a few minutes sporadically throughout that it's not worth it. Take the risk of jumping out of your seat for once, because it was the best scare I could ask for.9/10. Not Martin's best work, but come on, could you make a better movie than him?","

"blackmambamark","16 February 2010","Sure everyone knows the typical Scorsese film. Normally there is a mob present, or in most cases, a tough brute who loves to flash the ""F"" bomb in almost every sentence. But what about a thriller? I mean sure, we have seen it in ""Cape Fear"", probably one of my personal favorite remakes. But what about a top notch mind bending thriller that really makes you think. Something the likes of which we have never seen Mr. Scorsese do. But given his previous works of art, its really hard to doubt that he cannot pull this off.Grasping the concept of this movie is a no brainer. There is a mystery on this island filled with crazy people, but you can tell that there is a lot more under the surface. Yeah, it doesn't sound that original........but my oh my, you just wait until Scorsese begins to pick at your brain. Not since ""Taxi Driver"" have i seen Scorsese really make a valiant attempt at a character study of someone going insane. In ""Taxi Driver"", its like your in the back seat......watching as Robert Deniro slowing progresses into his insanity. With Shutter Island, its like your inside the mind of Dicaprio, and everything is starting to crumble. Scorsese really does a fantastic job of toying with your mind. You cannot help but second guess everything your thinking, but then again, i think that was the ultimate goal.......and yes, that was hint towards the end, which i think will raise a lot of debate. Now i always hear the phrase ""Twist and Turns"" when someone describes a decent thriller. Then i see the movie, and i say to myself........""That was a Twist and Turn? It felt more like a road bump."" But in this case, Scorsese really does re-define the term. Because in this film, you really have a hard time judging what is actually real, and what is not.......and what you think is happening, is actually not happening at all..........that is a twist and turn people. Not you finally figuring out who the masked killer is at the end.......okay, im sorry that all thriller movies are not like a Scooby Doo episode. And since we are on the subject of crappy thrillers......i am so glad that Scorsese chose not to use elevated music in some of scenes. For example, someone jump out of a dark corner......in most cases, the music is raised and the audience jumps.......but in this movie, Scorsese doesn't add any music at all......he just uses the fear of an eerie set to make your skin crawl. Much like an old Hitchcock movie. However, there is music in this, and let me tell you, it is so very fitting. You can tell Scorsese has been down this path before, so he sort of used the same style that he did in ""Cape Fear"", with Benard Herman's deep, dark, and haunting tones that just pull you in more and more. Honestly, there is not one bad aspect of this movie. The acting, the directing, the score, the cinematography.....all pieced together with one hell of a script.Bottom Line........people, this is what a thriller is suppose to be. Especially a psychological thriller. I thank god for directors like Scorsese.....because this movie really isn't his type of film. My guess is he saw enough crap in this genre' and had enough.......so he threw his hat into the ring and gave a rebirth to the classic Hithcock type thriller.......not only that, i really think that he redefined it in a way. Now i know that it is really early in the year, but i can easily see this movie staying in my top 10 of this year. Absolutely fantastic film, best i have seen so far.","

"ComedyFan2010","12 June 2018","I guess when looking at the names of director and the cast one knows that it can't go wrong. And it didn't. I loved this movie through it's 138 minutes and it didn't even seem that long.Now I can't say if the big twist towards the end was very well hidden. Unfortunately I heard it before I watched it. Which is not surprising considering that I waited almost 10 years to do so. So when watching there were moments where I would think ""Now here people should have guessed it"". Especially in the second half of the movie. But this could just be me knowing it and seeing the clues more clearly, just as people who rewatched it did. But regardless, even though I knew the ending I really enjoyed the movie so somebody who guessed it at the very beginning but still was questioning it would as well.The cinematography is great. So much film noir in it. It is a movie that gives one this suspense that keeps one watching. The cast is all great. Including the small parts of guards and mental patients. And the main characters gave so much character to the movie. I won't list all their names because I literally would list all of them. If anyone of them would played by a different actor it wouldn't be the same.And I loved the ending. I am not talking about the twist that I already discussed but the very ending. The final quote that makes us understand the ending better. I loved it. This actually took me by surprise and I think it couldn't have ended better. It gives the movie and DiCaprio's character so much more depth.","

"bkoganbing","13 March 2010","Shutter Island is a body of land in Boston Harbor which has a hospital for the criminally insane. It's run by a pair of doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow who have certainly essayed roles of some very deep villainy. Couple that with the fact that this film is set in post World War II where America has just been fighting with people who have mysterious accents like Von Sydow and Kingsley. It's a recipe for a Hitchcock like thriller.US Marshal Leonardo DiCaprio has been sent to Shutter Island with his new partner Mark Ruffalo to investigate the disappearance of a woman who was declared criminally insane by the courts and is now confined to the island facility. Though it is a hospital also, primarily Shutter Island is a prison and run by the Federal government and subject to their jurisdiction. Although Ruffalo is content to follow DiCaprio's lead, Leo's not happy with the lack of cooperation he's getting on the investigation, even more unhappy that inclement weather is forcing he and Ruffalo to stay on the island. Something suspicious is going on and DiCaprio's going to get to the bottom of it.Actually something very suspicious is going on there, some very intricate mind games are being played, some experimentation is being conducted by the staff. But trust me, it's beyond DiCaprio's powers of grasp.Shutter Island marks the third film that Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio have teamed as director/star. It's possible Leo is trying to tie Robert DeNiro for times working with Scorsese. This part is certainly one a younger DeNiro might have done. I don't think Shutter Island ranks up there with either The Aviator or The Departed it's still an intricately plotted story and one where the lead has to be convincing or the film goes nowhere. DiCaprio doggedly plods on with his investigation while battling some inner demons that the audience is gradually let it on. A younger DeNiro couldn't have been better.The rest of the cast ably supports Leo, but in the final analysis Shutter Island belongs to him and to Martin Scorsese for putting it all together. Alfred Hitchcock would be proud.","

"Screen_Blitz","31 December 2015","Martin Scorcese has laid many cinematic landmarks in crime genre, and as a result, has earned a spot as one of the most influential directors to ever step foot in Hollywood. He has been met with much critical acclaim with his gritty portrayal of the gangster life in his film such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and The Departed. Teaming up with his frequent collaborator Leonardo Dicaprio, Scorcese takes a more dark and surreal direction in this psychological thriller set with plenty of twists and turns. Leonardo Dicaprio plays U.S Marshal Teddy Daniels, who travels across seas to investigate a mysterious and deserted island along with his partner Chucke Aule (played by Mark Ruffalo). There lies a hospital run by Dr. Cawley (played by Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Neahring (played by Max Von Sydow) holding mentally insane prisoners, where Daniels and Aule are in search of a patient named Rachel who has mysteriously disappeared. Going further into their investigation, the two quickly turn the dark and sinister secrets behind the wretched prison of a hospital, soon to the point where Daniels deteriorating of his mental state and his identity all together. Mixing elements of neo noir and elements of pure horror, this film conveys a dark and surreal plot that unfolds to something truly shocking and well crafted in a unique way. The psychological elements conveyed throughout the story go very deep in ways that may remind those who seen films like 'Seven' or 'The Sixth Sense' as these both deal with individuals who are psychological damaged. This film paces steadily through one spine- chilling thrill after another, and as the story progresses, the tone gets more and more eerie; building up an astonishing plot twist at the end that is likely to leave you startled. Like David Fincher's 'Seven', this film never lightens up in tone, giving you the feeling of hopelessness throughout its run time, yet it's still entertaining. The plot doesn't go without its flaws however. The film has its moments where gets overly convoluted to the point I could leave you scratching your head. Ultimately, the plot picks up not to soon before it reaches its grim climax.Leonardo Dicaprio has been one of my favorite actors for as long I can remember, an actors always shows off powerful performances, yet has never landed an Oscar for his works. His performance as the main character Teddy Daniels is terrific. He is very charismatic throughout, especially when his character go through some spine-chilling changes. Mark Ruffalo who plays his partner also deserves some applause for his performance, playing his role very solid and willfully. Ruffalo is who I believe is an underrated actor and hope garners an Oscar one day (as well as Dicaprio). Shutter Island is a twisted, but stunning piece of entertainment by Martin Scorcese, complete with a terrific screenplay, powerful performances, and a strong narrative that grabs your attention. This is much different than the typical Scorcese fare. Nonetheless, it is astonishingly entertaining.","

"gradyharp","10 June 2010","Too rarely are we offered films that are so well written (Laeta Kalogidis does a marvelous adaptation of Dennis Lahane's mesmerizing novel) that after viewing the audience is almost afraid to leave the theater or home screen for fear they may have missed some important information that will help them figure out why the story is so successfully enigmatic. Such is the case for Martin Scorsese's brilliant film, SHUTTER ISLAND. It is only in retrospect, after the shock of the film is over, that the magic of quality cinematic achievement can be appreciated. Then in rethinking the events the film portrays so well the story is as straightforward as Scorsese's vision. The film opens in 1954 nothingness - from out of the fog slowly appears a ship headed toward Shutter Island, a terrifying prison for the criminally insane, and almost incidentally we meet US Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) emetically cloistered in a ship's lavatory while his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) awkwardly waits for him on deck. The two are on a mission to investigate the escape of a female prisoner. They are greeted by curious wardens who escort them onto the terrifyingly ugly and ominous island to meet with the famous psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow). Curious restrictions are placed on the Marshals who decide to return to Boston because of lack of cooperation from the psychiatrists. A hurricane prevents their exit and slowly the story unwinds: Daniels is haunted by memories of his war experience in viewing the concentration camps in Dachau and delusion of his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) in nightmares he cannot explain. The various aspects of the Marshals' investigation lead them to all of the compounds where prisoners are kept and treated and surgically altered and the terror mounts. To tell more of the story of one man's descent in to madness would distract from the viewer's own grappling with the conundrum of this tale. It must be seen to appreciate the brilliance of the story. In addition to superb performances by DiCaprio, Ruffalo, Kingsley, von Sydow, and Williams there are astonishing well crafted cameos by Patricia Clarkson, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, John Carroll Lynch and a very large cast of bit players. The cinematography is superbly crafted by Robert Richardson. The music score for this moody piece is a montage of works by such brilliant composers as György Ligeti, Krzystof Penderecki, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Schnittke, Lou Harrison, John Adams and even Gustav Mahler whose rarely heard 'Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor' plays a significant role in the film. On all accounts this is a superb film. Why it did not do well in the theatrical run is puzzling: perhaps it is a long film that is way ahead of its time. Watch it on DVD and become absorbed by all the bizarre mysteries it captures. Grady Harp","

Nothing is what it seems at the facility though, and the further Teddy & Chuck investigate, the murkier the truths of Ashecliff become.Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is adapted from the best selling novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane (""Mystic River/Gone Baby Gone""). It finds the talented director getting closer to horror than at any point in his career, it also finds him arguably over cooking his grits. Lehane's novel is a page turning lesson in thriller writing, there's no need for deep cranial thinking or fill in the blanks like musings. Scorsese has crafted a movie that, whilst both stylish and moody, is far more intricate than it needed to be.From the off we saw reams of amateur reviewers dissecting the film and searching for other worldly cinematic meanings. The truth is, is that they don't exist, it is just a great story pinging with psychological twisters. Lehane himself said he felt it was a book he kind of knocked out while in his flow (he undersells himself mind). Scorsese, clearly loving the source to be sure, has crammed too much in for the film to be an across the board winner. Technically accomplished? Without doubt. Depth to the story? You bet. But the reality is that the depth isn't enough to sustain all the genre blending atmospherics that is Marty's want. One is inclined to feel that he so aware that he is treading on well worn genre ground (spot the homages to film noir, old time horror and Hitchcockian grandeur), that he's trying to steer the viewers away from the obviousness on offer. The film is further let down by the second half, where it positively crawls along, something not helped by the fact that the first hour bristles with moody excitement and a promise of clinically executed terror. Anticipation can be a real killer at times...Yet as is normally the way with a professionally assembled Scorsese picture, there's still so much to enjoy and moments that ensure it will always be a divisive film in the New Yorker's cannon. The cast are mostly great, DiCaprio delivers a stunning performance, one that can only be appreciated once the story has reached the climax. Ruffalo (restrained), Ben Kingsley (shifty) & Max Von Sydow (troubling) all do what is needed and in keeping with the tone of the piece. While the girls - Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson & Williams - have small but crucial parts to play.Then there's the supporting characters played by some quality character actors. Koteas is joined by Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levein & John Carroll Lynch. How many of you noticed that we here have a roll call of cinematic serial killers? Edgar Reese, Freddy Krueger, Buffalo Bill and Arthur Lee Allen! (OK, Allen was not proved but ""Zodiac"" the movie lends us to believe it was him). The music used is suitably heart pounding and Robert Richardson's photography is on the money, especially within the dimly lit Ashecliff walls (the foreboding Medfield State Hospital for location filming). The costumes also have a nice 50s look to them, our first encounter of Teddy & Chuck sees them splendidly adorned in film noir hats and coats. While Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is up to the usual tight standard.It's always tricky when great directors are involved, so unsurprisingly we witnessed at the start a difference of opinion with the critics as to how good Shutter Island is? What most agreed on was that the film fluctuates in quality and should have been, given the talent behind and in front of the camera, a much better picture. There's also no getting away from the fact that if you have read the book first the impact of the ending is considerably weakened. Personally I feel Scorsese was the wrong director for this particular source, but that's me, and be that as it may, he still manages to come out of it in credit with his fans - though even if he just passed gas some of them would proclaim it as a masterpiece... 7.5/10","

"gregeichelberger","24 February 2010","Last year, I lamented the fact that Martin Scorsese's long-await psychological thriller ""Shutter Island"" was relegated to the dead movie month of February, especially when it was receiving serious Oscar buzz at the time.Rumors floated about that the studio and Scorsese had come to a rift, that Marty wanted too much money, that he was being punished for being the most arrogant yet most talented director in the biz. Yep, as these stories flew, I sided 100 percent with Scorsese and felt he was being persecuted - once again.Then I saw ""Shutter Island."" Now I know what the fuss wasn't all about.If ever a motion picture needed to be seen in February this is it. As difficult to watch as it is to review, ""Shutter Island"" is a psychotropic mish-mash of ""Shawshank Redemption"" meets ""Vertigo"" meets ""The Sixth Sense"" meets ""Inglourious Basterds"" meets ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" all neatly wrapped up as an ode to Alfred Hitchcock but coming off as simply a nod to Brian DePalma.Littered with weird visions, wild hallucinations, back-breaking plot twists and - unfortunately - scene after scene of dead children, this movie laps itself in confusion and covers itself with a thick layer of obfuscation leaving one shaking one's head and wondering just what the point of the entire enterprise was.Now, no doubt, those who love this film will toss about accusations of the stupidity of this scribbler, that he has no clue about the nuances of the Dennis Lehane novel from which it came; or the depth of the emotional screenplay adaptation by Laeta Kalogridis (whose last major screenplay was the wonderful, historically-accurate ""Pathfinder"").That being written, to me, this movie had so much potential - all of which was smashed to bits by heavy-handed direction, a punch-in-the-face musical score, dead-end plot lines and a mystery that Nancy Drew herself would have found far too easy to solve. Then, after the endless maze of twists and turns we're forced go through, the movie takes a lame swipe at McCarthyism - where was Charlie McCarthy when I needed him? It's 1954 and U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo, ""Where the Wild Things Are"") arrive at a creepy federal asylum for the criminally insane off the coast of Massachuttes. Evidently, a young woman prisoner - who drowned her three children - escaped and they have been called in to investigate.I write ""evidently"" because nothing is as it seems in this picture, but one will get used to that. Treated as intruders by the bellowing guards and like idiots by the high-toned doctors (Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow), the two marshals carry on their investigation, even though a ""Jurassic Park""-like hurricane is threatening to overwhelm the entire island.In the meantime, Teddy is having bizarre hallucinogenic nightmares featuring his wife, Delores (Michelle Williams, Oscar nominee for ""Brokeback Mountain""), who perished in a fire set by a guy who is housed in this very facility. In these dreams, Delores keeps trying to give Teddy clues about the film, but he refuses to listen.He also relates how, as a U.S. soldier liberating one of the Nazi death camps, he and others lined up German soldiers against the wall and machine-gunned them. I'm not sure why these scenes were in the movie, since they had nothing to do with the plot - then again, NOTHING in this movie had ANYTHING to do with the plot.Teddy even tracks down an old college friend, George Noy (Jackie Earle Haley, Jr., ""Little Children""), now housed in the dreaded C Ward; and later meets a facility doctor hiding out in a cave raving about the Cold War, mind-control experiments and brainwashing techniques. But like everything else, these story-lines, too, come to dead ends.We now not only begin to question Teddy's sanity, but our own as the film takes even more hairpin turns until arriving at the single most disappointing conclusion of any Scorsese film ever made, especially in the light of Teddy's last bold declaration, which I was hoping (against all hope) would rectify and redeem his character, as well as the film.Fans of the director will no doubt appreciate this effort and I do, too, in some respects. The acting, especially DiCaprio, Williams and Kingsley, are without flaw. The newly-hot Haley, Jr. huff and puffs admirably during his two-minute screen time, Von Sydow is appropriately German and Ruffalo basically reacts to Teddy the entire time.The cinematography of Robert Richardson (""Inglourious Basterds,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""Kill Bill, Volumes 1 and 2"") is always amazing, as well. His gritty, creepy, atmospheric view of the daunting Gothic castle-like structure takes on a life of its own.It's a shame that Scorsese had to litter it all with dead kids, half-hearted nowhere scenes and incidental characters which turn out to mean absolutely nothing. I'm not an idiot and I don't want my films fed to me like a toddler in a high chair, but it doesn't hurt to walk away from a movie feeling one has gotten SOMETHING out of it.Is that too much to ask?","

"mrcibubur","28 March 2010","I watched this in the cinema on a Friday night and expected a horror film because it was hyped as a horror film. Make no mistake, this is a chilling psychological thriller and I can quite see why Scorcese likes to work with Leonardo (from 'The Departed') and with Robert Richardson from the cinematography for 'Inglorious Basterds'.As others have commented, Scorcese has borrowed (but not stolen) from Hitchcock suspense movies and the scary flashbacks remind us of the recent 'Inglorious Basterds' and at times 'Cape Fear'.There is nothing to laugh or cry about in this movie and there are no really gory scenes, though some scenes (as in Pans Labrynth) I question whether I can expose my 11 year old Son to see.This is a challenging and intelligent movie although for the first 40 minutes or so, I do wonder if I am watching a comedy as Leonardo as (Teddy) spars with Ben Kingsley (as Dr Cawley) in the 'why am I really here?' stakes.The film also reminded me 'a touch' of Michael Douglas in'The Game' where you are never sure what is reality and fantasy. As a movie goer, we have the right to expect the unexpected and we got it for sure in this movie.I am not a Scorcese fan and as much as I like the movie overall, I understand why it is not suitable for Oscar nomination.I like the ending of the movie personally and I have never read the book. Hands up who has read every book for every movie out at the moment? The final scene between Leonardo (as Teddy) and his Partner Chuck linked with the opening scene on the boat perhaps tells the story we want to know while puzzling throughout on everything which happens in between.Yes definitely see this movie but no need to take the tissues for this one or hide behind any bedsheets if watching on DVD. Absorbing, interesting and one to reflect upon afterwards.","

"Theo Robertson","15 January 2011","Martin Scorsese is in my opinion the greatest living movie maker . He started off during the New Hollywood era in the late 1960s and is described as a "" movie brat "" , a film maker who was brought up on a fine diet of cinema during his formative years and it shows . He is very much an aficionado of cinema and this in depth knowledge shows in SHUTTER ISLAND The story itself is somewhat similar to the works of Val Lewton and Scorsese shows his influences and he builds upon the tension . He's on record as saying he's been a big fan of British cinema and anyone who remembers the opening shot of ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE will have noticed a similarity to the great British director Michael Powell . Throughout the running time the cinematography emulates the glorious rich and lurid look of a Powell film whilst Scorsese adds grotesque imagery of his own . Even if you're not overwhelmed by the story there';s still much to admire about the movie !!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!Alas the problem with the movie is that it's constructed around a plot involving a twist ending . Scorsese has never been a director who makes plot driven movies , he makes character driven ones but the faults of the film are down to either screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis or even the original source novel by Dennis Lehane . There's two ways the film will end . One that is similar to SHOCK CORRIDOR - the One I was hoping for - or the one we did get which was the one I hoped we wouldn't get . Scorsese deliberately uses unrealistic mis-en-scene on occasions that shows where the movie is heading but even if he didn't you'll still manage to work things out for yourself There is a telling question the film poses at the end if it's better to live as a monster or to die as a good man ? but this isn't enough to rescue the pay off . Worse still the screenplay has an overlong sequence where the plot is spoon-fed to the audience as if they've been in a coma for two hours . INCEPTION is another film that felt the need to explain its plot mechanics . One worries that in the future we'll be seeing a film directed by Michael Bay where characters have to explain what explosions and loud noises are All in all SHUTTER ISLAND is something of a disappointment as has much of the director's work in the 21st Century . Movies like THE AVIATOR do improve on second viewing since they're character driven . The problem with having a high concept plot is that once the cat is let out of the bag it stays out of the bag . That said it is remains a highly impressive film on a visual level and posing the question of "" Is it better to die as a good man than live as a monster ? "" is consistent in keeping with Scorsese's running theme of existentialist angst in most of his work .","

"tsquared226","16 February 2010","Really, Scorsese should just give it away for anyone. The man is one of the most brilliant directors of our time. Anyway, let me get to the actual movie; I just saw it at a early screening and have to write this while I'm thinking about how stunning it was. Shutter Island is certainly not a typical film, not even for Scorsese. It is a different take for the director, and he does it, as he does every film, perfectly, so much as to be in his own league of film-making. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this: Shutter Island was completely unexpected, and a great start to 2010. It had all the components of a great film, and then some. The acting is spot on from every character; none of it seems forged or out of place. The script is fantastic; it has one of the most intriguing plots I have seen in a while (exception being Tarantino's Basterds). Everything, down to the set's lighting, was perfectly executed. I will say that not everyone will like this; Shutter Island, again, isn't your typical movie. To those, though, who do choose to see this film, be ready for a compelling, gripping, thought-provoking experience, so much so that you might think to see it again for further clarity (I know I will; it was so entertaining and my mind was blown!). Don't be surprised if you see this at the next Oscars...","

"gavin6942","19 February 2010","US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are dispatched to Shutter Island, a facility that combines mental health treatment and criminal detention. One patient, Rachel Solando, is missing and has slipped through the walls as if through evaporation. Where on the island could she have gone?DiCaprio and Scorsese are a great team, let's just say that right away. If you've seen ""The Aviator"", ""The Departed"" or -- my favorite -- ""Gangs of New York"", you are aware of the greatness these two can achieve. While I do not feel ""Shutter Island"" is on par with ""Departed"" or ""Gangs"", it can still be counted as a fine film in its own right.The scenery captures the feel of the 1950s and the dank lonesome feeling that accompanies insane asylums of this period. Much like Arkham Asylum, the very building itself comes off as creepy and disturbing as those it houses. Poorly lit, plenty of stairs and mezzanine, and a feeling of oozing insanity. The inmates here are nasty, not least of which is George Noyce (played by the same man who brought us Rorschach and the upcoming Freddy Krueger). Michelle Williams, while only seen in dreams and flashbacks, really captures the viewer with her role of Dolores. This is quite possibly her best role yet, overshadowing her work in ""Brokeback Mountain"". Could we see a Best Supporting Actress nod? I freely admit that tears were brought to my eyes by her performance.I appreciated how closely the film followed the book by Dennis Lehane (author of ""Mystic River""). Unfortunately for those who read it, the twists won't be as shocking, though you might pick up on the clues before your friends do. The film downplays much of the detective aspect, and almost completely removes the code-breaking parts. You could fairly say it has been dumbed-down.Scorsese, or his screenwriter, have also added in plenty of extra violence to turn this into a bit of an action flick. An extra gun shot here, a needle there, a firing squad sequence... this works well to keep viewers engaged. At the same time, the inclusion of the Dachau flashbacks dragged the pace down, and I think this will not work with some audiences. The biggest complaint I've heard yet was about the film's length.After seeing what I felt were disappointing previews for ""Shutter Island"", the film comes out well and on par with the book, a rare event. They use every tool at their disposal to amp up the visuals, and while the final twist may have you recalling other films (it's not the most original), all in all it's a fine piece of cinema. Along with ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" and ""Youth in Revolt"", it is one of the best films of 2010 (so far).","

"tbmforclasstsar","14 February 2010","From the first note of the score, to the last shot on the screen I was completely enthralled by Martin Scorsese's latest Picture. Shutter Island, the story of two federal marshals investigating a patient escape at a maximum security hospital for the criminally insane, is very simply put: an experience. Shutter Island works because it pulls at all different emotions. An audience is both humored, and on the edge of tears; jumping out of their seat, and sinking deep within it. For 2 hours and 18 minutes, one is completely submerged into a Gothic, noir like world that is intriguing and horrifying at the same time. Shutter Island is definitely under the genre of thriller, but it is much more than just this. Sir Kingsley said it beautifully the next day at a press conference I attended: ""Though it looks like a thriller, the glue that holds it together is varying levels of tenderness."" The characters are enthralling and real, whether it be the protagonist, Teddy (DiCaprio) or Dr. Cawley, the head psychiatrist of the asylum (Sir Kingsley). From the opening shot to the final scene, the audience is left guessing to the mysteries of this island and its patients, being thrown into a world that is extremely claustrophobic without being tightly spaced. This feeling, and the success of the island's atmosphere, can be credited in many ways to the film's iconic director, Martin Scorsese. Fresh off his first Oscar ever for Best Director in The Departed, Scorsese takes things to a different gear in Shutter Island. While The Departed was a modern day mob thriller, Shutter Island is set in the 1950's, post WWII and at the start of the Cold War and McCarthyism Era. Paranoia is at an all-time high, many people are on edge, and this story is not only set during this time period, but on a secluded, Gothic island with only one way to leave and at the start of a terrible hurricane. If that doesn't excite an audience, it should simply be Scorsese's style. The film is full of flashbacks and haunting dream sequences that range in location from the island itself to the concentration camp at Dachau. The audience is constantly trapped in a world where one questions what is reality and what is dream. This is already interesting on paper, as seen in the critic's praise of Dennis Lehane's novel which the film is adapted from, but Scorsese absolutely blows the audience out of the water with the visuals; frightening images of pain and anguish, terrifying fears and paranoia, and jarring cuts and sequences that leave the viewer as haunted as the characters themselves. Scorsese truly rolls up his sleeves and produces a powerfully intense film that shakes the viewer until the very end.Aside from the amazing direction, the acting performances in this film were quite moving as well. Dicaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Sir Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, and Emily Mortimer were brilliant in their roles and (with the help of a masterful director's skill) took Shutter Island to a terrifyingly beautiful place that keeps us wanting more and more. From every beautiful crane shot, to each close up, Shutter Island is the latest tour de force in an already astonishing resume for Martin Scorsese. No one ever escapes Shutter Island unscathed, but if you can handle its pure power, it truly is a fantastic cinematic experience.","

"ElMaruecan82","14 October 2011","Guess who praised Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island""? Roger Ebert! The cinematography, the spooky atmosphere, the film noir's overtones, the whole psychological torment, the ""buried trauma"" to quote him, as so many voices speaking in favor of ""Shutter Island"", another great achievement from the greatest director of his generation.Marty might be the greatest as the most consistent director of the New Hollywood generation but I hate how 'great Marty film' started working like a pleonasm, as to underline a tacit rule that any movie made by a great film-maker automatically deserves the benefit of the doubt, in other words: if you hate it, you didn't get it. I'm sorry again, but the director who committed this cinematic piece of unoriginality is not the passionate artist who enriched cinema with so many masterpieces, like ""Mean Streets"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" and such delightful little gems like ""The King of Comedy"" or ""After Hours"". I'm sorry but Marty didn't gain in maturity, not even in craftsmanship, he purely and simply  lost his touch.I have the biggest respect for Scorsese, and also for Ebert, and the reason I mentioned the latter is because he's certainly Scorsese's number one fan, but he's also one of these privileged persons who've seen so many movies in his life that he would be the least likely to get so easily impressed by a film, that blatantly exploits every single cinematic cliché, considering the story's material. The movie is so 'obvious' that it would be tragic if it wasn't so laughable. And it's obvious because it works on that reverse effect, as movie fans, we know that whatever seems obvious in the first act will probably be contradicted. True BUT whatever seems obvious is exactly the opposite of what is shown during that very first act, because we know we're being tricked by the director. In that case, it's like Scorsese was the 'sprinkled sprinkler', and Ebert's implicit denial of the script obviousness says a lot about his recurrent loss of subjectivity whenever it concerns Scorsese.I don't want to number all the clichés: the two detectives investigating, the entrance in the island with a haunting atmosphere emphasized by an ominous music, begging you to be scared, or impressed, a weird feeling of unrealism in some backgrounds that made me question what the artistic approach was, let's just call it 'homage' to old-school cinema, this one never gets old. But I wouldn't have expected this emphasis on the tone, screaming ""Beware  danger"" not even from old-school directors, and certainly not from Hitchchock. Okay, we got the idea that something will go wrong; it doesn't even trust our patience as Di Caprio acts weirdly from the very first scenes. I was pleased by Ben Kingley's performance as the charming head doctor, but it's getting old since Nurse Ratched and I didn't mention Fritz Lang, because there are less risks that he might be known by the targeted audience.And I'm not even implying that the movie is not worth watching, but it plays like an overlong build-up for a weak climax, a build-up, during which nothing very pleasing happens. And I mean 'pleasing' in the pleasing meaning of the word, seriously. What happened to Marty's sense of entertainment? Why such a constant need to be dark, Gothic and gloomy? Is that Cinema's new emotional trend? Are we supposed to endure this atmosphere during the whole picture? Can't we have a break? a distracting element, not necessarily a comic relief, but I don't know, a subplot, an interesting character, even Hitchcock did itno, again, the time-filler relied on the guilty trauma, the good old theme so cherished by Marty, and that provides the best alibis to rationalize his films. And we discover his wife played by a beautiful Michelle Thomas, and some horrific flashbacks featuring the Nazi's atrocities, always a good taste to combine the supernatural horror with the real one, that's what the movie needed in case we thought we would cheer up at the end. Or was he just surfing on an opportunistic wave introduced by Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds""? The weaknesses of the plot canceled out all the cinematographic attempts to justify the movie's cinematic merit. Nothing special happens, nothing really happens, and again, it's so damn hard to feel sympathetic toward Leonardo Di Caprio! Yes, I have a big problem with Di Caprio in Scorsese's film, because of that same constipated face he has to display, to remind us that he's playing a tough guy. Did Bogart look tough? Di Caprio is a good actor, even great sometimes, but this is becoming one of his most annoying trademarks. I miss the young, lively Di Caprio with sparkling eyes and youthful look, because tough he isn't, and he doesn't fool anyone, and this is probably why the only Marty's movie I thought he delivered a great and flamboyant performance was ""The Aviator"". The first thing I see in a Di Caprio film now, is the poster, tough-guy-constipated-face? I avoid.An indigestible film with a risible attempt to scare us, I will stop here because I'm tired of being so critical about the director whom I praised most of his work from the 70's to the 90's. But he just doesn't do justice to his glorious filmography, Scorsese is a man of gripping realism of psychological torture and it doesn't need a supernatural flavor to taste good, it's scarier when real and more than that, Scorsese is a damn entertainer, with a unique talent of storyteller, and not only the story isn't told well, but it's not even a good story, as far as originality is concerned.And when comes the final scene, with the final line, supposed to summarize the whole message of the film and justify the whole build-up, my only reaction was : ""so, we got from that  to that?!"" and this is my exact feeling when I compare between Marty's earlier and later works.","

"moonspinner55","15 March 2011","Once director Martin Scorsese attained widespread acceptance from moviegoers (and mainstream critics) with the massive commercial success of ""Cape Fear"" in 1991, he quickly turned into a 'blockbuster' filmmaker, one who had his pick of top-rank collaborators. The Scorsese name became a brand--like Spielberg's--however, the movies he has chosen to work on since do not always echo the interests of the young, raw Scorsese. With ""Shutter Island"", an adaptation of a novel by Dennis Lehane, the stamp of Scorsese becomes interchangeable with that of Shyamalan, De Palma, Polanski...even the ghost of Stanley Kubrick, whose ""The Shining"" seems to be an inspirational starting point for this thin, shuddery yarn. Leonard DiCaprio plays a U. S. Federal Marshal in 1954 investigating the disappearance of a female mental patient from a locked-down asylum in the Boston Harbor. Elements of other films keep turning up in Laeta Kalogridis' poor script, which incorporates (at various intervals) concentration camp detail with a triple homicide that is both exploitative and distasteful. The large cast is solid, for the most part--Scorsese has retained his uncanny ability to bring out the best in his actors--though I'm not sure how deeply DiCaprio is feeling his role. His frequent scowl doesn't reveal anything but a petulant nature, which, coupled with his youthful appearance, doesn't lend much conviction to a character who is alternately a soldier, a family man, and a government employee. DiCaprio is making a career out of seeming miscast; since this entire house-of-cards plot rests on the star's shoulders, the final denouement isn't the heart-breaker it should have been. The picture is vividly atmospheric and features excellent technical detail, yet it is a glum undertaking burdened with overwrought profanities ill-suited to the era. This is what Martin Scorsese wants to bide his time with? ** from ****","

"bababear","20 February 2010","The premise of SHUTTER ISLAND was fresh and original...the first dozen or times it was utilized in a story.MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD.BE WARNED.The idea that the main character is really a patient at the mental hospital, not a federal marshal investigating a disappearance there, has been done countless times. Very early in the narrative I figured out that the story was being told from inside Teddy's mind and kept waiting for some reason that this much money was being spent and this talented a group of people working so hard to tell this story. There must be some other twist coming that will make this worthwhile.Nope. It just gets worse and worse, and sillier and sillier.This would provide great material for Mystery Science Theater 3000. Tonight people all over the theater were laughing out loud, and not at any points that were supposed to be funny.The screenplay, to be generous, stinks. Fine actors read dialog that is as stilted as can be. The musical score is equally bad, with shuddering, ominous strings underlying scenes and trying valiantly to drown out the awful lines those poor actors were forced to say.Because the story is being told through the eyes of an insane characters, the continuity lapses are understandable. A hurricane blows over the island, causing considerable damage. For whatever reason, though, the storm is selective. Huge trees are uprooted in some places but in other places there is no visible damage at all.In one scene near the end Teddy wakes up to find three supporting characters standing around his bed. It brought to mind the scene at the end of THE WIZARD OF OZ when Dorothy wakes up to find her friends have been watching over her while she sleeps. Did Scorsese not realize the similarity? There was one fascinating mystery that I hoped would be explained but wasn't. Teddy makes his way to a lighthouse and runs up the stairs to find one of the doctors from the mental hospital in a office.OK. It's a lighthouse. There's a spiral staircase running through the middle of it. How in the world did the doctor manage to get a desk, chairs, file cabinet, lamps, etc., three stories up a spiral staircase? And why? I'd ask the same question of Scorsese. You and some brilliant actors made this turd.Why?","

"krycek19","12 March 2010","I usually have nothing against being influenced by a movie if it appeals to me and has a good story. Shutter Island did neither for me.The music in the opening scene is trying way too hard to create an eerie feeling that Shutter Island is a place of evil. And the music reminded me of Cape Fear. But Shutter Island is far far from the greatness of Cape Fear which is Scorses all time masterpiece in my opinion. This however is his worst movie.It is not DiCaprio's fault, but the horrible deeply flawed screenplay.* SPOILER AHEAD * I would have liked to have Leo's character not been insane and developed an alternative reality in order to protect himself from the memory of his drowned children and the wife that he shot.If the movie had been about him coming to find a missing patient and expose Ben Kingsley and the other doctors as vicious attackers of patients, then it had perhaps been a good movie.Teddy's memories of WWII is also just boring and have no great importance to the plot. Yes I know that the dead girl in wagons represent his daughter that he could not save. But it's damn uninteresting.The plot does not make much sense either. Leo is really a patient himself on Shutter Island, and to get him to accept his past, all physicians, psychiatrists, prison guards and patients are acting to support his idea of reality. How likely is it that doctors could get criminally insane to help in this way? It would not be feasible. They are all just as crazy as Teddy. If not more.How likely is it that a German doctor could get Teddy to wake up when Teddy, because of his past as a soldier, hates Germans and basically sees him as a Nazi? They offer Teddy alcohol. It would probably just be tea they had given him had he said yes but he would probably have noticed it. And then what would they have done? If the goal is to get Teddy to accept his past and that he is patient, why are the doctors then doing everything they can to act suspicious and untrustworthy? What if Teddy had bolted when he was aboard the ferry with his partner/psychiatrist? It could not have been prevented.How likely is it that the U.S. Marshalls are told to hand over their weapons when they are searching for a missing patient in a prison/institution for the criminally insane?Teddy's gun is a toy gun. How likely is it that Teddy does not until the very end discovers that it is made of plastic, not metal and wood? Especially when he is suppose to be extremely intelligent.On the whole, they let a seemingly very dangerous patient walk freely around the island for several days. They let him blow up a car and knock a guard out. They would never let it come so far in reality.What is the meaning of it all? Why put the whole circus together due to one mental patient? Why feed on his delusions, if the goal is to make him accept his past? Why is he more interesting than all the other patients? Why don't they just talk to him and give him medicine that prevents him to invent an alternative reality? Yes it is 1954 and yes the time they knew not what we know today and yes they would probably give him a lobotomy as it is indicated they will at the end of the movie. But still.There is so much that does not make sense in the movie and when it itself is so cliché-filled, I really can not take it seriously.","

"LeoCrow2002","10 April 2010","If Paramount Pictures had released Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island last year – the original release date was October 2nd, 2009 – I would have considered the film the best movie of the year. As it stands, the rest of 2010 has a long way to go in terms of matching the quality and effectiveness of Scorsese's new picture. It's a fascinating character drama, an exciting and almost experimental exploration of the human mind, a reinvention of the horror genre and a dynamic acting showcase for its star, the incredible and still very underrated Leonardo DiCaprio.Shutter Island is also an incredibly appropriate entry in the Scorsese canon – it's a film about an alienated man haunted by his past. Add Teddy Daniels to the list of Scorsese's tragic and multilayered antiheroes – Jake La Motta, Travis Bickle, Henry Hill, Howard Hughes, Billy Costigan, Rupert Pupkin, Jesus Christ. The film also continues Scorsese's fascination with our understanding of violence (it should be noted that our perception of the lead character's violent actions changes dramatically when watching the film for a second time).Shutter Island is eerie from the very beginning. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) steadily approach an island off the coast of Massachusetts known as Shutter Island, a mental hospital for the criminally insane. The year is 1954, and Scorsese and music supervisor Robbie Robertson subtly incorporate vintage (and sometimes downright disturbing) 1950s music into the sound mix. Once on the island, Daniels and his partner meet with Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), who explains to the Marshals that one of the island's patients has mysteriously disappeared overnight. The investigation that ensues is a fascinating exploration of insanity.Hovering over every scene is a paranoid, post-war anxiety shared explicitly by our protagonist and thoroughly felt and realized by Scorsese. Tensions rise as Teddy recalls horrific memories from liberating a concentration camp during the war, and his suspicions of Nazism and conspiracy by the House of Un-American Activities on the island become our suspicions. The best Scorsese films force the audience to live inside the minds of moderately-to-severely delusional characters weighed down by an enormous and overwhelming guilt. Shutter Island does just that. There is an unease throughout the entire film, deliberate disturbances in continuity that some audiences might mistake for sloppy editing. That's simply Oscar-winning editor Thelma Schoonmaker toying with the audience, making us question the reality we're watching and the reliability of our protagonist. The film is a brilliant melding of film noir, detective mystery and psychological horror, at its very core an exploration of an emotionally disturbed human psyche, disguised as a Hitchcockian thriller that works as both a homage to Scorsese's favorite psychological thrillers from the 1940s and 1950s while simultaneously elevating itself into something larger and more complicated. When you watch Shutter Island, you're not just watching Scorsese's film – you're watching thousands of classic movies at once, assembled together in a picture conceived by a filmmaker whose encyclopedic knowledge of film history pours into every detail of every frame, so much so that an already-genuinely suspenseful scene of DiCaprio racing up a flight of winding stairs simultaneously serves as a homage to Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Red Shoes (1948).Unfortunately, Shutter Island has come under attack from, as my good friend calls them, the pseudo-intellectual crowd. From what I can gather, the general complaint is that the movie takes itself too seriously dramatically, and that some of the dramatic shifts in the film are laughable. Perhaps this is because Scorsese refuses to compromise his vision by winking at the audience. When discussing The Best Films of the 1990s with Martin Scorsese in early 2000, film critic Roger Ebert notes that at some point in the 1990s, existentialism, ""the idea of what we do with our lives,"" was ""replaced by irony, so that everything has quotation marks around it."" He then adds, however, that Scorsese's ""films are not in quotation marks...they are meant.""And he's absolutely right. Scorsese can't make an ironic film - a film too afraid to deal head- on with real, palpable human emotion, therefore putting the actions of its characters in huge quotation marks. My favorite films of the past few years don't have ironic quotation marks around their characters, either. I don't buy movies that do that – it's a cheap way of pleasing the cynical, highbrow crowd who only accept genuine human emotion in films if it comes from Pixar Animation or a foreign-language film. I love those movies, too, but I haven't given up on serious American films that aim for high character drama and succeed. I'm talking about Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003), Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005) and now, Shutter Island. These are films that take their characters and their plights seriously.Every negative review I've read doesn't seem to consider how effective the film is on a visceral level, how strong and forceful the performances are from top to bottom and the powerful manner in which screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis keeps the story grounded in the deep emotional turmoil of its characters. Shutter Island is a real film, the kind they don't make anymore, exceeding the supposed limitations of its genre and offering its audience something challenging and psychologically fascinating. Scorsese doesn't have to make movies anymore - he's already made more masterpieces than any other living filmmaker - but we're lucky that he's still exploring his obsessions in new and inventive ways. Shutter Island should be met with applause, not simply because the film marks the latest work from our finest living filmmaker, but because it's also the best damn movie you'll see this year.","

"ikanboy","27 February 2010","***********************SPOILERS++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ The movie starts off seeming to be a ""creepy"" thriller about the escape of an insane killer from an island fortress, somewhere off the shores of Boston. It's standard stuff for the first 45 minutes or so, with the usual attempt to make the criminally insane look scary. Mood is everything here, but as the movies have been down this path so many times, and as-in my case-I know that the insane are not particularly scary, it's a question of wondering why Scorsese is going down this trite path.When he shifts the plot to a ""conspiracy"" plot it gets even triter. And then it shifts ponderously to a ""fooled you"" ending. The story tries to confuse with it's shifts, but underneath it all it's all sturm and very little drang. When the ultimate plot line is revealed it's a big let down. It's ""spellbound"" rehashed.The big problems for me were that it continues to trot out the usual myths about mental illness; it's symptoms, it's causes, and it's cures.","

"Legendary_Badass","19 February 2010","A 1950s ward for the criminally insane isn't a pleasantry for anyone. The terror behind the walls has a mystique to the public. It's as though unspeakable acts of torture can exist within the confines of padded rooms so long as the public never witnesses first hand. The isolation, or in the case of Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island the possibility of it, could be enough to drive you insane.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels. Having met up with new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), he's on assignment to investigate the disappearance of Rachel (Emily Mortimer) from the secluded mental hospital on Shutter Island. During his visit, Teddy is plagued by vivid recollections of his days as a soldier liberating a Nazi death camp and visions of Delores, his deceased wife (Michelle Williams). These tie in with Teddy's ulterior motives: investigating rumored inhuman experiments and locating his wife's murderer.I didn't read the book; get used to it. I watch movies and I review them on their own merit. I'm not one to bicker about the source material being wronged when I know full well that a book typically contains an unfilmable heap of situations that need to be whittled down into entertainment in a convenient sub-three hour block. I care about the movie, and in the case of Shutter Island I speculate that fans of the book will have a far different experience since they should have a very solid notion of what happens. For me, someone new to the material, Shutter Island is captivating.When it comes to the plot there is a ton that I'd like to discuss, but can't simply because this is a puzzle film and I don't want to ruin it's intricately woven pattern of suspense. I'll say that some elements are very familiar, but that doesn't stop it from being a shocker. Elsewhere I can say that it's a well-crafted film on technical levels. The visions of the dead wife are often complemented with CGI that's used with discretion. Cinematography is strong, showing the colors reminiscent of a similar era prison film, The Shawshank Redemption. Originally I felt that the theatrical score was beating me over the head, but it didn't take long to assist in providing atmosphere. Editing also plays a role as cuts are made in unorthodox fashion, purposely creating misaligned audio, but this pertains mostly to the dream sequences. The cast even excels as each role becomes deeper than speculated. Leo gives another powerful performance now that he's cleared the hurdle of being typecast as ""the kid"".When it comes to the twisted thrillers, I prefer endings to be less blatant. With Shutter Island the longwinded conclusion spells out every last possibility. I'm not looking for something open to interpretation, but requiring more participation. There's still plenty of evidence to spot that you'd want to view it again for the details or chat with friends. As I think more about it, that's what separates the thrillers from the horrors. The thrillers make you think about outcomes, motives, and twists. Shutter Island doesn't tie itself into a knot, but it gets close. That frustration can polarize an audience, but if you've trusted in me this far then you're ahead of the game.NOTE: If you are playing the Shutter Island drinking game, be sure to take a shot each and every time Mark Ruffalo says ""boss"". That's the only rule you'll need.","

"kosmasp","9 September 2010","This is a thriller that builds up very slowly. Really slow, so slow, that some people got bored. And got their fangs out for the ending. That's just a matter of taste then. Even the ending is low key and will not be there to satisfy anyone (though it is one clever way to end a movie, which left me with my mouth open).Martin Scorsese might have gone thriller at least once before, with ""Cape Fear"", but this time we really dig into another world. Leonardo DiCaprio pulls out a great performance once again. Even small roles are cast with great actors to really give the whole thing some weight. It's a great psychological thriller ride then.","

"MBunge","14 October 2010","With Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese has made the greatest Brian De Palma movie of all time. However as a Scorsese film, Shutter Island is just a bit above average.Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federal marshal in 1954 sent to investigate the escape of a prisoner at an asylum for the criminally insane on an island off the coast of Boston. He's joined by a new parter, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), who spends most of the movie as one of the most useless sidekicks in cinema history. While investigating, Teddy has to deal with the interference of Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), the head of the asylum, and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow), the asylum's chief head shrinker. In addition, Teddy is plagued by memories of his role as a US soldier in the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp and by very involved visions of his dead wife (Michelle Williams), who perished in an arson fire. It turns out that Teddy is looking for the arsonist who set that fire and believes he's somewhere in the asylum. It also turns out that Teddy suspects there's some sort of brainwashing taking place on the island that has something to do with the House Un-American Activities Committee. Then after all of that, there's an elongated twist ending that neither truly succeeds nor truly fails.The modern standard for the twist movie is, of course, The Sixth Sense. That's because if you took the twist completely out of it, it still would have been a great movie with a compelling story that stood on its own. Shutter Island does not live up to that standard. Take the twist out of this film and there's really nothing left.Of course it is well directed and well performed. We are talking about Martin Scorsese and a very talented cast of actors. But the story is jammed full of things that just don't work as the movie unfolds, like the uselessness of Mark Ruffalo's character and an excessively melodramatic soundtrack, which are explained and supposedly redeemed by the swerve at the end. The problem with that is twofold.1. You can see a twist coming a long way away. You might not be able to figure out exactly what it's going to be, but there's enough stuff that either seems forced or doesn't make sense to clue you in that something is going to happen. The story doesn't hold together on its own, so you know there's a missing piece that will eventually be revealed. And once you realize a big revelation is coming, it spoils both the set-up and the payoff.2. A twist can't retroactively make a movie more enjoyable. The clanging off notes in the script that are later justified by the twist, remain clanging off notes while you watch them the first time. It's like the fruit at the bottom of a yogurt cup. No matter how much you enjoy the fruit, you need to be able to enjoy the yogurt you have to eat to get to it. The yogurt of Shutter Island seems overstuffed, contrived and simplistic.Don't get me wrong. Shutter Island isn't a bad film. It's atmospheric, well paced and narratively ambitious. The movie pretty clearly falls short of fulfilling those ambitions, though, leaving you with the impression that it should be much better than it is. Scorsese and company have made a decent film that many viewers would appreciate. That you can't help but expect more than that, really isn't a fair criticism.","

"politically_incorrect204","20 February 2010","I hate to say this as much anyone else but for me this film had a horribly disappoint ending. First before I delve into that I'd like to say that the acting, the writing, the shooting, the film in general as far as quality goes was very good. But the ending was very disappointing. And no I am no idiot or newbie when it comes to film. But I thought the was very much a cop out. Now granted I know this is based off of a novel, hence there are certain restraints to adhering to this novel somewhat. That being said I found the idea of the medical experimentation, mental hospital, nazi experiments, and astray patients much more tantalizing, realistic, and more full of potential. The trick ending where its all in someone's head is done far too often sadly. I was hoping that while it dragged one there at the end it would ultimately reveal he was playing them or that he would stay true and not give in. But that didn't happen. I guess for me I was just expecting something not so cliché for an ending from the likes of Scorsese's genius mind. But all things said and done I definitely can't give this movie all negative remarks, wonderfully acted and scripted. Great atmosphere, shooting, photography, etc. But I feel the ending should have been less cliché or not as cheap I guess. Felt like it was just an easy way out and not fully developing the tension and intrigue that they had built throughout. But either way its each to their own, so maybe you will appreciate the ending more than I. FYI - I do understand the undertones of the ending and the ambiguity, but I don't think that saves the ending or does the film justice in it's entirety.","

"Michael_Elliott","21 February 2010","Shutter Island (2010) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio's fourth outing together is a brilliantly made that has two hours of build up to a masterfully handled final twenty-minutes. In the film DiCaprio plays U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels who with his partner (Mark Ruffalo) travel to Shutter Island, a mental hospital where a female prisoner has escaped. Teddy and his partner try to break through with the main doctor (Ben Kingsley) but he appears to be hiding what may have really happened. Meanwhile, Teddy continues to suffer migraines and bad dreams of his wife (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire shortly before current events. Out of the four pictures and director and star have made together, I'd probably call this one here the weakest even if it might be the best made one they've done. As I said, this movie has two hours worth of a drawn out mystery that has one brilliant touch after another and then we get hit with a chilling, extremely effective and at times disturbing third act that perfectly puts all the pieces together. Best of all is this is the type of movie that will guarantee people to be talking years after its release.The technical side of things make this one of the most beautiful and haunting Scorsese pictures out there, which is saying quite a lot when you consider how many great films he has made. What I really loved the most was his wicked cinematography that perfectly puts you on this island and really captures all the possible evils going on. Even better is the music score that's one of the most haunting in recent memory. It perfectly builds up a nice tension and an overall doom and gloom that hasn't really been matched since the wonderful score in THE SHINING. Speaking of the Kubrick film, I can't help but think it was some sort of influence on Scorsese as the two films don't just try to go after cheap scares but instead they build up a strong story and then give us everything else second. Like the Kubrick film, a lot of this movie takes place during the daylight, which again adds a weird and surreal nature to the film. With that said, there are a lot of scenes in dark hallways and dungeon like cells that really work as well as the art direction and set design are top-notch. Other visuals work as well including an extremely beautiful and haunting sequence when DiCaprio first ""sees"" the ghost of his dead wife and they have a discussion about the missing patient. The performances are also another very strong part with DiCaprio once again showing why he's one of the best and most interesting actors out there working. He gives another strong performance and it's rather amazing to see how much he can do and how much he can deliver whatever is asked. He perfectly fits the violent side of his characters mind but he is also believable during the conclusion of events and how everything plays out. He handles the emotion scenes extremely well as well as some of the lighter ones. Williams is also very refreshing in her scenes in the film, although she doesn't have as much to do. Ruffalo is also very strong and works well with DiCaprio. Veterans Kingsley and Max von Sydow are wonderful as well as Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley and Ted Levine. The performances mixed with everything else really makes this a complete film from start to finish. Again, the first two hours are pretty much just building up everything that follows. Perhaps a second viewing would change my opinion on this but I do think a little of this could have been edited out and we wouldn't have missed anything. With that said, one does have to admire the screenplay for getting so many different things in (including a haunting Holocaust sequence) and be able to work them in a way where it all comes through in the end. The ending, which I won't spoil, will have people talking for years and I'm sure many different theories could be made about what happened or didn't happened. To me that's the sign of something special and Scorsese really delivers once again.","

"tedg","13 March 2010","Scorcese is an accomplished cinematic mind. There is no question of this. When he dies, we will celebrate the loss of a talent.But his life has been compromised by limits in the depth of his religion of cinema. This has haunted him, and he will not be happy to die until he conquers this.The problem is simple. I'll call it the curse of the character, and link it to Dante, or even Homer. That it dominates much written narrative is purely an accident of war. This is the idea that humans exist as complete, each one of us carrying a universe within us that some of us are able to project and carry around us.If we build stories, then, the stories are about the nature of the worlds attached to characters. The characters can actually be tragic, manipulated by their own world forces, or even uninteresting. But no matter how you slice it, the narrative follows people and the containing world is an annotation, an effect. I believe this is ""Italian"" in film-making and Scorcese was captured by it. Unfortunately for him, the cult of the actor in Hollywood (and associated market forces that support critics) feeds this. So he adopted deNiro and made films that were at least competent. But the camera could only follow bodies.But all the real juice in cinema is in this idea of noir. It has penetrated everywhere to some extent because it matters. The religious cosmology of noir has a world that exists apart from any humans. It pre-exists, has its own laws and dynamics. Being external to the souls of humans who appear, it blows them around and tinkers with those souls.It has the advantage that the film's narrative can entangle the existence of the world with the viewers and their needs. It brings the film to the viewers in a sort of contract, a dialog that cannot be refused. It also allows the camera to exist in a world apart from the characters. Thus, the filmmaker can inform us of the situation. Space matters. Texture, color, light all have their own lives.Scorcese has been bothered by the fact that his films did not do this; could not. Here he was with the craft, the skills, but not the vision. So in one of the most intriguing inner stories in Hollywood, he attempts to escape his own limits.He shifts from deNiro-like actors to deCaprio style. He tries, really hard to discover. His ""Gangs"" was a noble attempt, but a failure because of problems with funders. ""Aviator"" was his first noir success, helped by the influence of Cate (playing Kate). Check out the story, which mirrors Marty's plight. Marvel in that cool scene where the room is filled with strings.The rat movie was a retreat. And now this. It is a pure victory, an personal achievement. Some of us have been rooting for the man in his encounter with himself and are doubly rewarded with this film.There are elements in the story that reflect this quest of the filmmaker. I wouldn't want to focus on them too much here, because the reader may think that the story itself matters more than it should. But see the references to Spielberg's similar quest with ""Close"" and ""List?"" See the imposition of the noir narrator and the notion of slippery trust? See the folds in the anagrams? Look how at the end, we have shifted truths but the ambiguity remains. He could indeed still be the investigating cop, now compromised. In fact, this could be a flashback to the episode we learn happened nine months previously. (Note in particular how the tie changes toward the end.)Those story elements would have made a good comment. I'll do that elsewhere. Here the point is to look at how Marty has a new eye. Look at how the camera is almost never anchored to a person. Look at how it always — always — starts with some focus on an element of the world then slips to catch a person (always Teddy, then his focus). Look at how well we understand the importance of location, architecture, place, space, situation. Look at how for the first time ever, Marty shows space: flying paper, ash, dust, hail, leaves, trees. Look at how he even explores the architecture of water a bit. Watch with admiration as he announces his love for Thelma (his editor), and allows her some rubato in how the thing is paced because she owns the clock of the world, now hers.My immediate context: I saw this in a theater with a pride of chattering young Marines. They could not follow the story and left laughing at themselves.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","

The sets are so over the top at one point Ben Kingsley blames them on a civil war general. The big twist of the story is obvious from the trailer, even from the thirty second TV spot, to anyone over the age of twelve, who has seen a mental hospital movie. In case we needed some exposition Leo meets a women in a cave and he exclaims ""you're the real..."" in case we couldn't figure it out. Add in the concentration camp flash backs that would make Tarantino cringe and fifties paranoia, nothing floats. The movie looks good but Marty get your hearing checked.","

"BA_Harrison","3 March 2016","While investigating the disappearance of a murderess from a hospital for the criminally insane, US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes to suspect the staff of using the prisoners for medical experiments.Halfway through Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island and two possibilities crossed my mind: the first and most disconcerting was that the film would be a totally incomprehensible piece of self-indulgent surrealistic nonsense; my other concern was that, after two and half hours, it might finish with a supposedly clever but actually rather trite explanation for the events that had occurred—like the main character being one of the institute's patients, for example. But this is Scorsese, I reasoned, he surely wouldn't pull a Lynch or a Nolan on me.Think again, Brett After much confusion, Scorsese does indeed wrap up matters by revealing that Leonardo DiCaprio's character is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, having lost his marbles after shooting his wife for drowning their three children. It's far from the most unpredictable of twists, but—and this is a BIG 'but'—Scorsese's masterful direction (there's creepy atmosphere in abundance) and a strong central performance from DiCaprio ensure that the film is still a reasonably entertaining ride despite the frustratingly foreseeable denouement.","

"jimbo-53-186511","17 September 2014","1954; US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is investigating the disappearance of a patient who has escaped from a psychiatric hospital on Shutter Island. Once Teddy begins his investigations, he notices strange anomalies such as; Rachel managing to escape from a room that has been locked from the outside, the fact that she manages to bypass all the other patients and security staff without anyone noticing etc. Daniels is puzzled by Rachel's seemingly 'unexplainable' disappearance and is determined to get to the bottom of it.I'll be the first to say that mystery films are probably my favourite genre (when they're done right) and films like Shutter Island help to cement that feeling. Shutter Island hooked me in straight away due to how creepy it looked - this was down to some superb cinematography. Then as the film progressed, I found that I was more and more hooked in. Shutter Island takes you in one direction, but then pulls you in another direction and it's all these twists and turns that help to keep things fresh. I felt a constant sense of paranoia throughout this film. I found that I never knew who I could trust when I was watching this film and this merely helped to increase the suspense. Daniels' dream sequences gave his character an added depth, but also added another layer to the plot. I found that Shutter Island not only kept me in suspense, but also kept me thinking and the two elements combined are cinematic heaven as far as I'm concerned.Acting wise, Scorsese has got lots of big players on board such as DiCaprio, Kingsley and Von Sydow to name a few and all the players on board put in stellar performances. As mentioned, the cinematography was superb and this really helped to give Shutter Island a creepy and mysterious feel.Where Shutter Island falters slightly is in the heavy handed way it dealt with one particular plot twist (which I won't reveal). Suffice it to say, this did lessen the impact when it was revealed. However, just when I was prepared to be majorly disappointed, Shutter Island throws in more twists and turns after the obvious twist was revealed and these added twists did surprise me somewhat.This is an excellent film that will most likely appeal to fans of psychological thrillers or mystery films. I loved it and would strongly recommend that you watch it.","

The fantasy part is half-baked with some clumsy clues, and then we get memories of the holocaust to illuminate the hero's past. Was that really necessary? I was thinking Jacob's Ladder, but I didn't like that either and it was a better movie than this.The figuring-out part is like an '80s Hercules Poirot episode - neither scary nor emotive, just flipping over the cards as it suits the dealer. On top of his holocaust experience, the hero also had a mad homicidal wife. Bloody hell! The final flashback is awkward, and there's no effort to make us hurt for the children. The ending is ... ""led off in handcuffs"". Duh duh duuuuh! Way too elaborate for a simple story.","

"cherold","13 January 2011","Before I get into the spoilers, I'll just say this is an initially intriguing movie with a great performance by Michelle Williams and a great, brief performance by Ted Levine. It is beautifully filmed but overlong and predictable.********** SPOILERS BELOW **************
Shutter Island begins well. It has an eerie quality to it that at first suggests it will be some sort of horror movie. In fact, it is filmed as such all the way through, with spooky whispering and dark places and dripping blood. But it is not a horror movie, and much of the problem with Shutter Island is that the tone does not fit well with what the movie actually is.The movie starts out as detectives Teddy and Chuck come to an asylum for the criminally insane to find a missing patient. How did she escape, why didn't she take her shoes, why are the doctors uncooperative? Interesting questions, but it soon seems there is something more than this going on. Doctors make odd comments and give odd looks. Teddy has weird dreams and headaches. Doctors or patients sometimes say something that oddly suggests they know something about Teddy's life they shouldn't know. Early on, you realize that there is either some conspiracy involving the asylum or that Teddy is perhaps insane.At a certain point in the movie, it is clear that it is the latter. When Teddy tells his partner that HUAC, the anti-communist organization, is funding medical experiments, it was clear to me that Teddy was a paranoid-schizophrenic. And almost everything in the movie past that point fits with that being the case.The problem is, the movie keeps playing along with Teddy long after it's obvious he's crazy. There have been very good movies, like A Beautiful Mind and Repulsion, that gave the audience a peak into mental illness, but they didn't try to toy with the audience as long as Shutter Island does. By the time it becomes clear that Teddy is insane, the movie needed to have ready a twist to reframe everything we saw. Instead, Teddy continues with his investigation. It is not until the very end that the reveal happens, and while it adds some interesting details and offers alternate interpretations of previous events, it is too little too late.A twist only works if you're not expecting it. If you're waiting for it, and waiting for it, and it doesn't come, it's just kind of boring.I was surprised to discover when I came to this site that a small number of people take Teddy's story at face value, insisting he was sane and driven crazy by the doctors. This makes absolutely no sense, but perhaps it's a result of people not being able to accept that genius Martin Scorsese made a rather obvious, unexceptional movie.Visually impressive, with some nice scenes and good performances (Williams is awesome as the dead wife), Shutter Island is still overlong and underwhelming. I wish Scorsese had just gone ahead and made the simple thriller I thought was coming instead of this psychological muddle.","

"Elvis-Del-Valle","10 November 2023","Without a doubt, another of Martin Scorsese's best films, Shutter Island is a clever and quite original psychological thriller. It is a story that has not been seen in other films and with an intriguing twist. Leonardo DiCaprio has always been a talented actor and here he does a wonderful job as Detective Teddy who will discover that his reality is not what it seems. It focuses a lot on the psychology of the character with a series of flashbacks and nightmares that are key to discovering the truth about this character. It has a very good atmosphere that knows how to combine suspense with dramatic moments. You can really appreciate the production, the photography and the dark atmosphere that can be felt in some scenes. The script is quite intelligent, giving many key pieces that come together little by little. The editing is somewhat questionable and some continuity errors are noted. The rest of the film is great and the way he handles trauma in a mind disturbed enough to create a different reality in order to bury said trauma is striking. Shutter Island is one of the best psychological suspense thrillers ever made and another great work by Scorsese. My final rating for this movie is a 9/10.","

"claudio_carvalho","27 June 2010","In 1954, the Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) from Seattle travel by ferry to the Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of the patient Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), who drowned her three kids, from the mental institution for dangerous criminals Ashcliffe Hospital. Teddy is veteran WWII soldier traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Duchan concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that his investigation is obstructed by the management by the Federal facility. Teddy has severe migraines and when there is a storm, Teddy and Chuck find that they are stranded in the island. Teddy interviews the internees, discovers that one is missing and follows a lead to the lighthouse, where he discloses the mystery about the sixty-seventh patient of the Shutter Island.""Shutter Island"" is a good but predictable psychological thriller. The production has a high budget and consequently a great cast, costumes, locations and special effects. However, the major twist when Teddy Daniels finds the truth about the Shutter Island and himself is not a surprise. In this regard, ""Identity"" and ""Haute Tension"" for example, work better and better and really surprise the viewer after the plot point. Further, the IMDb Rating Top 250: #246 is absolutely overrated. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Ilha do Medo"" (""Island of the Fear"")Note: On 05 September 2023, I saw this film again.","

"rmax304823","23 June 2013","It's well directed by Scorsese, nicely photographed, the locations and photography are convincing. Very atmospheric. It's the kind of storm that would send me scurrying to the cellar.But I'm beginning to wish M. Night Shyamalan had never turned ""The Sixth Sense"" into a successful movie, in which you can't tell the living people from the flashbacks from the ghosts from the hallucinations from the dreams.I was puzzled by the ghosts (or whatever they were) in ""The Shining."" Here's Jack Nicholson, heretofore troubled but sane, strolling into the deserted ballroom of the Overlook Hotel, slapping his hands on the bar, and saying with a big, welcoming grin, ""Well, HELLO, Lloyd! How's business tonight?"" And the accommodating bar tender suddenly appears and replies politely. Well, we know Lloyd isn't really there. Is he one of Nicholson's hallucinations? After all, Jack calls him by name. But later there are ghosts with masks on that Jack has absolutely nothing to do with. I'll tell you, it's a conundrum. The mind boggles.""Shutter Island"" has the same problem in spades. It's completely bewildering through most of its length. I finally caught up with it in the last five or ten minutes. It's even more confusing because the staff of the psychiatric hospital in which DeCaprio is a patient are playing roles that coincide with DeCaprio's delusions. Mark Ruffalo, whom I like, for instance, is in reality DeCaprio's primary psychiatrist but he's playing the role of DeCaprio's partner in the U. S. Marshall Service. The whole hospital is organized around DeCaprio's psychosis -- just to see if going along with his paranoia will somehow cure it.It's a nifty premise, but like the notion behind ""The Game,"" it's not just improbable. It's impossible. ""The Game"" was kind of enjoyable because it had its small comic moments but Scorsese clearly means this story to be tragic. ""Which is better,"" DeCaprio asks his partner/psychiatrist at the end, ""to be a living monster or to die like a hero?"" In other words, DeCaprio seems to realize he has a choice. He can accept reality and be the monster -- he murdered his wife. Or he can submit to a lobotomy and, somehow, go on being the innocent hero of the U. S. Marshalls that he once was.That lobotomy business is pretty aptly described, by the way. The operations began in the 1930s and António Egas Moniz, a Portugese neurologist, won the Nobel for using and describing the operation. Mostly it was a last resort and sometimes it worked, though with side effects. It was more or less discontinued after the discovery of anti-psychotic meds in the 1950s. If DeCaprio wants to go on living as a hero, he probably makes the right choice in choosing a lobotomy. It didn't usually rid the patient of his symptoms. It just calmed him down so he didn't act on them. DeCaprio will probably still think he's a federal agent but what remains of his personality will be a bloody stump and he won't care if they let him off the island or not.","

"Doylenf","22 February 2010","Relax. This review won't give away the ending which comes as somewhat of a surprise, although many will admit to guessing the overall situation pretty early on.If you like your mysteries drenched in atmospheric surroundings, look no further than SHUTTER ISLAND. Director Martin Scorsese starts out with murky skies and a foreboding of doom as two men (a sheriff and his partner) approach a rocky coastline on a ferry as an ominous looking island looms into view. The plot, although keeping the viewer in a sea of confusion as it unravels, only becomes clear toward the last thirty minutes--but until then, the less you know about the outcome, the more you will enjoy the satisfying ending.None of the exposition is direct. Instead, we see the story from the viewpoint of a man (LEONARDO DiCAPRIO) who is obviously very troubled about tragic incidents in his past and who only gradually begins to see things in a different light. His journey is compelling right from the start, thanks to the marvelous performances of DiCaprio and MARK RUFFALO who begin their investigation into happenings at the island housing the mentally insane--some of them very dangerous cases.Director Martin Scorsese has the benefit of an excellent cinematographer, ROBERT RICHARDSON, whose camera work makes every frame of the film captivating. All of the exterior scenes along the rocky coastline of Maine have a sinister look. The story is told in a leisurely way but there is always an air of mystery in the relationships between the main characters, including BEN KINGSLEY as the psychiatrist in charge of the institution and MAX VON SYDOW as a suspicious looking German doctor.It's best not to dwell on the final outcome--but let's just say it probably won't come as a complete surprise to everyone. Nevertheless, it's the sort of thinking man's psychological thriller that any mystery fan should be able to savor.","

"tieman64","14 July 2010","""Scorsese is old-fashioned and is making the same films that DW Griffiths was making early last century."" – Peter Greenaway (For Part 5 of this quest, see my review of Cronenberg's ""Camera"") The schizophrenic experience is an experience of isolated, discontinuous and disconnected material, signifiers failing to link up into a coherent sequence. Like the ""heroes"" of Cronenberg's later films, the schizophrenic does not know personal identity (identity depends on the persistence of an ""I"" or ""me""), is unable to create concrete models of self and world, and is incapable of experiencing continuity through time.These symptoms are themselves associated with our postmodern era, a schizoid age which philosopher Gilles Deleuze calls ""the control society"", in which fragmentation extends like a blanket across every aspect of our lives, from the sciences, to modern psychoanalysis, to our economic models, to technology, to culture/familial/social relations, to art and communication and further outwards and inwards in all possible directions. The last paradigm here is genetic engineering and nano-medicine, fields which are slow moving.Eventually this schizophrenic confusion scrambles or destroys the possibility of critical perspectives altogether, such as those found in modernist traditions. This is a direct contrast to the modernists who founded cinema, guys like Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Murnau, Renoir, all of whom were loosely allied with an ethic of social realism, and who attempted to capture the vital elements of social reality on screen. Such realism was depicted, for example, in the epic struggles of the Russian Revolution and classic depictions of poverty, exploitation, and upheaval within society. Over time, both modernism and realism followed the path of photographic representation, visible in a plethora of documentaries, docudramas, historical dramas, and other forays into cinema verite.Eventually, the modernising ethic spawned by Enlightenment rationality and 20th-century industrialism intersected with such wildly divergent influences as Capra, Huston, Visconti and DeSica. When modernism died in the 70s, postmodernism began absorbing the trendiness of Existentialism and reacting to the failure of Positivism's reductionism, and the collapse of socialism's New Left. It re-introduced content, but only ironic content, rejecting any form of realism and becoming anti-realist.So, in a very general sense, we move from the modernism of the 30s-60s (Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Renoir etc), to the last burst of rebellion in the 60s and 70s (new-modernists like Antonioni, Kubrick, Kurosawa etc who both upheld and critiqued Enlightenment principles), to an age of defeat, giving rise to the increasingly nihilistic, nostalgic and fantastical postmodern era from the late 70s onwards (Scorsese, Leone, Tarantino, Spielberg, Lucas etc). Or, using this century long period as a brain model, we have birth, a burst of hope, increasing disillusionment, impotency, a flight to fantasy and a mental collapse which gives way to pieces of rubble; the schizoid experience. The task now is to sort the rubble, re-organise and rebuild.This, of course, is what the character of Spider tries to do in David Cronenberg's ""Spider"" (""Spider"" is the same film as ""Shutter Island"", ""wife"" replaced with ""mother""). Cronenberg calls this his ""internet movie"", Spider slowly web-browsing through the debris of history so he can determine whether his father ""traded his mother in for a new one"". Except, the old mother is the new mother, both are prostitutes, and Spider's nostalgia, his need to recreate a happy family that didn't exist, is ultimately what corrupts or skews his own little internet search engine. Cronenberg's typical mind/body splits are thus reversed from this point onwards. The subject's ""computer memory"" isn't reconstructing the past, but actively and constantly destroying memories specifically so it can create new ones which satiate its short term desires.Enter ""The Departed"" and ""Shutter Island"", two of Scorsese's most schizophrenic films, which operate solely by cannibalising the past and serving it back up as a kind of postmodern, schizoid blip-time carnival. ""I don't want to be a product of my environment,"" Jack Nicholson says at the start of ""The Departed"", announcing the film's disregard for any larger, real world universe. ""The environment"", in this case, is but a collective data-bank of past images, memory traces which Scorsese rearranges and spits back out as mediated drug rush. If ""Goodfellas"" was every gangster cliché jazzed up for modern audiences (the very theme of ""Goodfellas"" is the falsity of itself as a film) ""The Departed"" is ""Goodfellas"" jazzed up, a mash-up of a mash-up, an amalgamation of an amalgamation, blended smoothly together to appeal to testosterone-laden males who get high off the head-shot gratification. In our post ""The Wire"" world (if ""The Wire"" hopes the map the world, ""The Departed"" turns away and serves up static), such things come off as pointless.Far more interesting is ""Shutter Island"", if only because it shows how far Scorsese has drifted from the neorealist ethic. In this case, the plot is a standard issue Scooby Doo tale in which a police detective investigates a crime at an insane asylum. Throw in countless ""homages"" to Hitchcock, Kubrick's ""Shining"", Lang and a plot that rips off everything from ""The Cabinet of Dr Caligari"" (it's the same film as both the 1920 and 1962 version), ""Repulsion"", ""Spider"", ""Next Door"", ""Shock Corridor"", ""Perfect Blue"", ""Fight Club"", ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", ""Lilith"" ""Detour"", ""After Dark My Sweet"", ""Le Orme"", ""Memento"", ""Inland Empire"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Others"", along with the Holocaust flashback-inserts of Lumet's ""Pawnbroker"" (Scorsese reduces the Holocaust to confetti), and you have one ridiculously evil movie, arguably Scorsese's worst since ""Cape Fear"". Of course it's also his most profitable film to date.The Departed – 7.5/10 Shuttler Island - 4/10 Compare Cronenberg's undercover movie, ""Eastern Promises"" (watch it again, it's gorgeous), with Scorsese's undercover movie, ""The Departed"". Then compare his schizoid movie, ""Spider"", to ""Shutter Island"". Cronenberg examines the very condition Scorsese now wallows in.(For Part 7 of this essay, see my review of ""Demonlover"")","

"JohnDeSando","17 February 2010","Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island reminds me of Hitchcock's successful Vertigo, Psycho, and most of all, Spellbound, without the success. The mentally unstable characters who provided Hitchcock hints of utter depravity in those classics in Shutter Island mainly serve facile plot twists.Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federal marshal who, with his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) goes to Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane in 1954 to investigate the escape of a notorious murderess of her own three children. Almost everyone at that Boston harbor institution besides the patients seems a bit off center, even Teddy, who brings some psychological baggage to the job.While the cinematography is appropriately claustrophobic and the 19th century industrial brick insane asylum and its accompanying Civil War fort reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs with a touch of Alcatraz, the plot twists are indiscriminately telegraphed while Teddy's recurring visions of his deceased wife are too many and annoying. As the resident shrink, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) is much smoother than Lambs' Dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald) but not half as fun. Nor is there a villain who can come close to Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. Although Teddy is the center of the film, Scorsese spends too many frames on tortured close-ups, as if he were making sure that DiCaprio is nominated for an Oscar next year. The film should have expanded the role of Dr. Naehring, head of the hospital, because the estimable Max von Sydow could have saved the film from boredom as the twists are telegraphed obviously and way too bluntly. In its favor, Scorsese plays deftly, if not a bit too obviously, with different camera angles such as bird's eye and visual images such as bright red blood, reminiscent of the stunning work in Sam Mendes' American Beauty.When you've directed Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull, you have a tough time topping yourself. Shutter Island is not a film to be ashamed of; it's just not as good as his greats.","

"troyhawke","19 February 2010","This review DOES contain spoilers.Right at the beginning of the film it becomes clear that this is supposed to be all spooky and scary. The movie tries too hard at creating an eerie mood, and fails miserably because it is so overdone, especially with the music. There are a few good scenes but most of it is repeated so many times it becomes tedious. The observant viewer will quickly understand (spoiler here) that the US Marshal actually is a patient there, and from there on in you just wait for him to ""get it"", and you no longer care about anyone or anything that happens. And the shocking twist at the end is no twist, its just a boring ""yeah, yeah, we get it""-moment. Of course he's on his way to get the lobotomy, yeah so he's not cured, maybe he chose not to be cured, blah blah blah, ""the ending leaves so many questions"" yeah whatever.It's too overdone, too obvious, too long and too boring. We are promised an exciting story but it does not deliver. This movie will probably be spoken highly of by all the know-it-all's, and if you didn't like it you'll be told that you ""didn't get it"".

"Richard-Nathan","3 March 2010","This review contains major spoilers. Please do not read any further if you have not yet seen this film and you have any interest in seeing the film at any time in the future.This film makes no damned sense, unless the point of the film is supposed to be that the people running the insane asylum are more insane than the inmates.For this film to make any sense, you have to accept the premise that psychiatrists who actually care about a mentally ill patient would try to cure such patient by doing things that would drive a sane person crazy; that they would play cruel head games that encourage delusional beliefs. How can any sane person believe that giving Teddy/Andrew evidence to support his delusions is going to cure him of delusions? In fact, as the film progresses, we see Teddy/Andrew getting more deluded, more paranoid, more violent. The role-playing is clearly counter-productive. Giving Teddy/Andrew reasons to believe his delusions would not cure him. This is proved by the fact that there are numerous people on the IMDb boards who believe Teddy was sane all along, throughout the film. If the role-playing can't even convince these viewers of the truth, how is it supposed to convince Teddy/Andrew?And for this film to make any sense, you also have to believe that these same doctors would give a startling degree of freedom to one of the asylum's most violent killers. Andrew/Teddy attacks a patient and knocks out a guard. He blows up a car, for goodness sake! That alone should prove it was insane to give him any freedom to wander alone, even for a short time. The movie was set up as a mystery - what is the secret of Shutter Island? But the resolution (that Teddy/Andrew was insane all along, and the doctors were pretending to be evil because they thought that would cure him of his delusions) makes no sense. There is nothing worse than a mystery where the solution breaks all rules of logic. It reminds me of the following joke:Dennis Lehane: What is furry, has four legs, purrs, and reads the newspaper every day? Richard Nathan: I don't know. Dennis Lehane: A cat. I lied about the newspaper.I thought that joke was annoying the first time I heard it, and it's annoying as the basis of the mystery in ""Shutter Island.""Furthermore, the resolution is not the result of any actions taken by the protagonist. The role-playing game doesn't lead Teddy/Andrew to discover the truth himself. He is merely a passive listener as the solution is explained to him. The breaks several major rules of screen writing.And what about the very end? Most people interpret Teddy/Andrew's last line as meaning Andrew is only faking his regression, so that he can get a lobotomy and avoid facing the truth. But if he were faking it, why would he give this away to the doctor playing Chuck? And why are so many people moved by this act of cowardice? Can there be anything more cowardly than someone choosing to get a lobotomy to avoid facing the truth about himself? Are we supposed to empathize with someone who chooses to destroy his own intellect because he doesn't have the guts to face the truth? I cannot understand how anyone can think this is an intelligent screenplay.","

Was it meant to entertain mostly teenagers, because the presentation was so over the top that M. Night Shayamalan will probably blush when he sees it? It was a psychological drama without any psychological depth. Leo was again cast in a role that was not right for him. What was needed was someone to physically embody the emotional turmoil the character had endured. And the flashbacks only make the intelligent viewer ask the obvious question, which is, why should we care so much about this one person's troubles when all those people were killed by the Nazis (or survived with their horrible memories)? That was an idiotic thing to include in this film, totally undermining it. Scorsese tried to do way too much here. He could've tried to do a ""modern"" version of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" for example. Then ending also didn't make sense to me, and was almost an endorsement of suicide, though considering how this impressed me as ""career suicide,"" perhaps it makes some sort of ironic sense.","

"howard.schumann","28 February 2010","Based on a novel by Dennis Lehane and adapted for the screen by Laeta Kalogridis, Martin Scorsese's psychological thriller Shutter Island is set in 1954 on a remote island off the Massachusetts coast that houses Ashecliffe, a mental hospital for the criminally insane. This is where Teddy Daniels, a United States Marshal played by Leonardo DiCaprio, arrives with his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando, a patient who was incarcerated after murdering her three children. The missing woman appears to have vanished barefoot without a trace from her locked cell during the night after leaving a strange note.Backed by production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Robert Richardson, Scorsese builds a dark, foreboding atmosphere that soon escalates into full-blown uncertainty and dread as the story unfolds. Incorporating aspects of different genres, Shutter Island keeps the viewer off-balance and unable to ascertain with certainty what is real and what is fantasy until the very end. As the investigation begins, we soon discover that the marshal has some back stories of his own that are making things more difficult for him. These include nightmare visions of liberating Dachau at the end of World War II and of lining up and shooting Nazi guards as payback. He is also beset with migraine headaches and flashback visions of his wife Delores (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire.Teddy and Chuck question patients and orderlies who last saw the missing woman but things become more interesting when they interrogate the psychiatrist in charge, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). Cawley talks a great deal about his disdain for pre-frontal lobotomies and use of Thorazine and his preference for talk-based therapy but puzzlingly refuses to provide the investigators with important documents they need for their investigation. Also interviewed is Dr. Naehring (Max Von Sydow) whose Germanic persona causes Teddy to have flashbacks of Dachau and raises doubts in his mind that he is being told the truth. People talk in whispers and everyone seems to be keeping a secret and the attitude of Warden (Ted Levine) and Deputy Warden (John Carroll) only adds to the mystery.As a Category 5 hurricane rolls in, it becomes apparent that no one is going to get off the island anytime soon and doubts begin to arise in Teddy's mind as to whether or not there really was a patient that disappeared or whether he may have been lured to the island under false pretenses. Before long we are immersed in whispers of government experiments being conducted on prisoners in the island's lighthouse, an item straight out of today's headlines where a fully clothed, mutated human body was recently reported washed ashore on Plum Island in Long Island Sound where the U.S. allegedly studies dangerous animal diseases.Fear is ratcheted up even higher when Daniels reveals a personal agenda of his own that sends the investigation off on a tangent. Unfortunately, the flashbacks, visions, and other visual pyrotechnics pile up, and what began as an intriguing mystery becomes an ordeal of repetitive psychological horror with the screen often filled with tasteless images such as those of dead children and holocaust victims. Though the last fifteen minutes brings a degree of resolution, Shutter Island ultimately wastes the considerable talents of its outstanding cast with an overwrought and overblown production whose premise is neither logical nor believable.","

"webmaster-3017","5 April 2010","Dark and intense mental therapy...Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor and together with director Martin Scorsese, DiCaprio moves up a notch. It is not an understatement to claim that Shutter Island only works because DiCaprio makes it convincing. It may seem to be one of Scorsese lesser work in first glance. However, the film does not disappoints, with enough suspense and interesting moments to get us through to the finish line. The ending itself is what made this film a cut above genre conventions. The film ends by raising more questions than it answers and in turn allowing the audience to decide for themselves as to what really happened. For me, it works, but for those looking for answers, it will probably just leave you wondering. Shutter Island is like a classic noir flick, its dark, its murky, it's even depressing, but it is also quite a satisfying experience to sit through.The movie goes like this: DiCaprio plays a cop who is assigned to an isolated island with a mental hospital. The year is the 1950s and a mental patient have escaped the maximum security of the Shutter Island. Together with his counterpart (played by Mark Ruffalo), they explore the island and like a haunted house or a horror story, nothing is what it seems to be.Ben Kinsley is what you call a method character actor. He has the unique ability to make even the griminess of smile into something hidden or evil about it. He has the grin and looks of a cunning interior. Kingsley plays a mental health professor, but somehow he is more to it than that. A clever actor in his own right, Kingsley made his character quite an interesting one to watch. DiCaprio as mentioned before carries the film with both of his shoulders. Maturity has certainly passed him by and not for the first time, he continues to impress me with the emotional range that he possesses. His moment of mental breakdown is a joy to watch and if that moment near the end is given to a lesser light, the film may have already been blown off the rails. This is a steady-fast performance that works.All in all, Shutter Island is a departure from the director usual aim of winning awards, but that does not mean that Shutter Island is any lesser of a movie. With strong acting turns from the increasingly reliable DiCaprio and the ever intriguing presence of Ben Kingsley, Shutter Island is convincing enough to be believable. The thought provoking ending may actually be a blessing in disguise. There is a quote that leaves us pondering: ""Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?"" For me, what it means is that DiCaprio chose to erase his memory and die a good man. The reason to it is simple. One of the saddest and toughest aspects of life is to have a good memory. Memories are what shape us, but also is what makes us more cynical and bitter about the world. At the end of the day, Martin Scorsese has created a movie that allows the audience to come up with their own viewpoint of what happens. Whether that is a good or bad thing, it is really the way you approach and think...(Neo 2010) I rate it 8/10www.thehkneo.com","

"bob the moo","23 January 2011","When a dangerous patient/prisoner manages to escape a secure and remote mental institution, US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his partner are sent to investigate. Arriving on the island they begin their investigation but find oddity and suspicion everywhere. As their investigation stalls and is hampered by those in charge, Daniels starts to realise that not everyone is who they claim to be, and that not even he has been honest about his motivations for leading the investigation.Shutter Island came and went and it got mixed reviews. My girlfriend watched it on a plane and disliked it, so it took me longer than normal to get around to watching it. What I found was a solidly enjoyable b-movie thriller which treads a familiar path but mostly keeps the viewer guessing right to the end. Those who have seen more than one film involving an investigation in a mental institution will not be surprised to learn that things are not what they seem, and the film does well to buy into this tone and embrace the rather OTT sense of reality or unreality. The soundtrack is full of heavy horns that compliment this atmosphere further. So in terms of what it is doing it all works really quite well but the problem is that it is overly long and needed to be tighter with a shorter running time. By being in excess of two hours, I was still held by it but at the same time it felt that it was a bit excessive and the longer it took to get to its destination, the more likely the audience were to be pulling at it to move faster.The performances are good. DiCaprio marked quite a 2010 with this and Inception, both roles that are genre films but with which he was able to do a lot more in terms of his character's psyche. Here he keeps the mystery alive and he takes the viewer with him really well. Support is strong from Ruffalo, Sir Kingsley, Levine, Mortimer, Clarkson, Koteas and others – all playing things close to ensure that there is this air of menace and mystery maintained. Scorsese directs with excess in a good way – striking images are used and I liked the way that there are no obvious visual triggers between reality and hallucinations/memories, this works well and I enjoyed the blurring for the viewer.Shutter Island is not a perfect film by any means; for what it is it is excessively long and takes too much time at the risk of the viewer getting impatient with its pace. However it does engage and it does work well with the material thanks to strong direction and performances. Well worth a look as a b-movie thriller despite the big names involved.","

"markgorman","14 March 2010","I don't want to be cast asunder for words of heresy but is Martin Scorsese losing it? I only ask because Shutter Island is a load of old claptrap. The reviews I've read seem to be unable to make their minds up about it and IMDb seems to have lost its marbles a little by awarding it 8.1 and a place in the coveted all time Top 250. Surely not for long when common sense kicks in and people review it for what it is. A mess.The movie really is a tram smash of ideas, styles and plotting. There's a neat twist in it but the utterly gratuitous Dachau strand to the movie is verging on the disgraceful. Parts of the film, certainly in the first half flashback to Di Capprio's experiences as an American GI liberating the Dachau concentration camp would be, you'd have thought, central to the plot. Not a bit of it. This strand hangs about meaningfully but without meaning. But that's the issue with this whole movie. It seems to want to inject meaning into a genre that really is just about entertainment. In doing so it lifts ideas from The Shining (some brilliantly), Silence of the Lambs (unconvincingly) and Hitchcock (at his worst) but they go nowhere. The cinematography flits about from the stunning, the scene in which DiCapprio and his young bride embrace during a fire is mesmerising, to the laughable - again DiCapprio is featured driving through a forest as a passenger with the Asylum's head warder in front of a blue-screened background that could have been shot in 1954 (the year the movie is set) - I suspect the latter was deliberate. If so it was another misguided idea.The grading leaps about from 21st century hi-def to 1950's colour-noir and can't seem to decide what it is that it wants to be.Dicapprio is unconvincing, so too Rufallo and Sir Ben Kingsley? Well, he is actually lampooning himself. Awful, truly awful.Do not waste your money on this rubbish.4 out of 10","

"maureenmcqueen","21 February 2010","Yes, Scorsese's eye is all over ""Shutter Island"" what I din't feel was his gut. And for me a Scorsese film bears his gut. From ""Mean Streets"" to ""The Age Of Innocence"", ""The King Of Comedy"", ""New York, New York"" The presence of his gut, his poetic gut, his Scorsese gut, made those experiences, emotional and timeless. ""Shutter Island"" is extraordinary to look at. It has some bravura shots that will take your breath away. It's no uniquely Scorsesian like, ""Raging Bull"" ""Casino"" or ""Goodfellas"" It doesn't have the energy and passion of ""Taxi Driver"" or the commitment of ""Bringing Out The Dead"", ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" or ""Gangs of New York"", doesn't have the freshness of ""After Hours"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" Doesn't have the scope or ambition of neither ""The Aviator"" nor ""The Departed"" but I liked it very much.","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","20 February 2010","Well, after months and months of waiting, Shutter Island was finally released this weekend. I've been dying to see this movie, I love Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio. These two together just equal gold and you are always sure to have a guaranteed good time at the movie theater. But maybe it's not always a guarantee; unfortunately, Shutter Island was a huge disappointment to me. The weird thing is, it's over something silly but important, the editing. We have fantastic actors, a great story, awesome direction and a spooky atmosphere. But the problem is, the movie does run a bit long, being at almost two and a half hours, it was exhausting to get through the movie. The beginning is so slow paced that it looses track of it's characters and by the time for it's exciting conclusion, I just felt a bit empty.It's 1954, and up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Shutter Island's Ashecliffe Hospital. He'd been gunning for an assignment on the island for reasons of his own -- but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's code-breaking skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals ""escape"" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues proliferate, Teddy begins to doubt everything -- his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.I feel so awful because I wanted to love this movie, I was expecting it to be my favorite film of 2010. Still Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo held their own and carried the movie very well. The whole feeling of the film was extremely spooky and does have some very frightening and intense moments. I absolutely adored the ending as it's a puzzle for the audience and it lets you make up your own decision on what has happened throughout the film. The story does have some clever twists and turns that should keep you locked in the movie. But like I mentioned before, the story really did need to be cut down. I have a feeling that if the movie was more like an hour and forty-five minutes, it would have worked a lot better.The tension just wasn't enough for me to keep interest, my friends were also a bit disappointed, they felt the same. By the time the ending and all the answers came together, they were just disinterested in the story and characters. Now, I don't mind a lengthy movie, but that comes with the exception that the makers of the film keep up with the action and whatever is needed to keep the plot going. I felt like the Nazi story that Teddy kept dreaming about could have been kept to a limit, it's constantly brought up. Also another question I had was that it seemed like Teddy seemed to favor his daughter over his other children and I don't know why; because when he finds out that his wife killed his children, he immediately rushes to his daughter vs. the sons, he also dreams more of her than the boys. The ending was also semi anti-climatic. The critics were saying that the ending makes the movie all worth it and while I agree it's a great ending, it fell flat the very last second for me. I'm thinking this movie would be better as a rental, because you have the chance to have better concentration at home with what is going on in the story. Martin and Leonardo did a good job, but the film just wasn't what I expected, but I guess we all can't be perfect, right? Just why did this have to happen with Marty and Leo? Well, here's to the next project with them, maybe it'll be better.7/10","

"Coventry","6 March 2010","Perhaps I should better begin this user comment by underlining that I'm primarily a horror fanatic and, moreover, that I have a specific exaltation for genre movies taking place on (A) remote inescapable islands and largely set in (B) mental asylums. I've seen numerous cheap horror movies, ranging from astounding to abominable, featuring one or both of these keywords and I personally think they are fundamental components to help determine the creepiness impact of a certain horror movie. ""Shutter Island"" features both these key ingredients as well, so normally this should have been one of my most anticipated movies ever, but instead I was quite skeptical ever since I first saw the trailer. First and foremost I'm annoyed again that everybody seems to avoid labeling this as a horror movie. Like it's still common to think horror is in an inferior genre that acclaimed directors and actors don't even lay their hands on. If you look on the main page on this website, ""Shutter Island"" is categorized as drama, mystery and thriller. I assure you, given the subject matter and the scenery featuring here, this is a horror film. It has everything to do with atmosphere and nothing with bloodshed or ax-wielding maniacs. Secondly, I tend to be very tolerant and easygoing on those aforementioned cheap horror movies because they're often low-budgeted and struggling movies from aspiring and hard- working directors. However, in the case of ""Shutter Island"", where the budget is practically unlimited and all the involved people are highly respected and critically acclaimed names, I feel I'm entitled to be extra demanding. I expect everything to be impeccably perfect, including the plot, the atmosphere, the set pieces, the acting performances, the directing, the continuity and the tension level. The greatest news to announce is that ""Shutter Island"" lives up to most of these expectations, especially when it comes to atmosphere and choice of locations. Right from the opening seconds already, you can tell this will become a thoroughly ominous and gripping film with a professional eye for detail. A ferryboat appears from a thick cloud of fog, there are clear signs of an approaching hurricane, there is recitation about an ""asylum for the criminally insane"" and the first long images of the titular island are brought under the guidance of excruciatingly sinister musical tones. The intensity of the opening sequence promptly grabs you by the throat and you want the two main characters – Federal U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule – to get away from the island as far as possible before they even set foot on it. ""Shutter Island"" first unfolds as a compelling mystery set in the paranoid and depressing post- WWII era of the early 1950's. The island is a controversial governmental place where the Doctors Crawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max Von Sydow) are running a mental institute facility for ""normal"" male and female cases as well as incurably dangerous patients. The Marshals are called to the island to investigate the inexplicable disappearance of a female patient, but there's obviously a lot more brooding underneath the surface. The doctors and wardens deliberately boycott the Marshals' investigation and Teddy Daniels has a personal and much more critical agenda to fulfill. He's looking for the pyromaniac patient responsible for the death of his wife and he intends to expose the island as a place where the American government uses mental convalescents as subjects to experiment upon. Teddy also suffers from painful War traumas, like the sights of frozen cadavers in a German concentration camp, and he still has conversations with his deceased wife Dolores. When the hurricane vanquishes the island, Teddy and Chuck see an opportunity to sneak into the infamous C-Block, where they lock away the worst cases and presumably the experiments, but the revelations where Teddy stumbles upon as from that moment are certainly not what he expected or hoped to find out. ""Shutter Island"" is the type of film that overwhelms and deeply impresses you with plot twists, subliminal themes, red herrings, convoluted conspiracy theories, character drawings growing increasingly complex and intriguing but ultimately irrelevant sub plots. The script feels like a solidly structured and tightly woven wholesome for as long as you're watching the film, but it's definitely worthwhile to analyze the movie afterwards. Unfortunately I can't elaborate too much without revealing some essential plot elements, but I urge you do it yourself. Once you leave the cinema or take the disc out of the DVD player, starting thinking back about the little things that were done or said throughout the entire film. Movies like this deserve to be discussed and analyzed rather than to just walk away with a feeling of overall astonishment. You'll notice that some minor details fit in perfectly with the denouements revealed at the end, whereas other story aspects will suddenly become illogical, senseless and implausible. And also, if you've seen a lot of grim, obscure and long-forgotten horror movies (the kind I talked about in the first paragraph), well than you honestly won't be surprised at what you see that often. You won't hear me claim that ""Shutter Island"" is unoriginal or predictable, but like so frequently the case, it does incorporate many little facets (whether just a certain noise, bizarre characteristic or tiny plot detail) that I spotted already in other movies. That really isn't a complaint; merely a footnote. I don't intend to say that ""Shutter Island"" ripped any other films, simply that horror fanatics are likely to be slightly less impressed than the more mainstream audience. My only main complaint is that I personally found ""Shutter Island too long. Admittedly I have a bit of an aversion towards long films, but I really felt that some of the sub plots and repetitive hallucination sequences could have been cut shorter. The filming locations, set- pieces and scenery are tremendous and particularly the re-creation of the 50's atmosphere is admirably accurate.","

"robert-temple-1","2 September 2010","Martin Scorsese should be ashamed of himself. He is such a brilliant filmmaker, and yet time after time throughout his career he has played footsie with the dark side, and supped with the devil. After all, there are all those gangster movies. What are they, if not glorifications of evil people and evil acts? Here we have Scorsese getting carried away with his own vanity and being 'ever so clever'. He has come up with an ingenious plot twist (although it is not new and has been used in various old movies), which I shall refrain from revealing because it concerns the end of the film, which one is prohibited from discussing on IMDb. But however clever Scorsese is, there is no disguising the fact that this film is dark, sinister, infinitely depressing, and a bad influence. When will vain geniuses like Scorsese exercise a little 'voluntary self-regulation', or indeed just the tiniest bit of self-control? Or are these spoilt brat genius film directors so thrilled by wallowing in their own vanity that they believe anything they do is wonderful and if we don't like it we are stupid? I say this film is bad not because it is badly made, but precisely because it is well made and thereby exerts its insidious influence all the more effectively. Somebody ought to tie Scorsese to an automatic spanking-machine which would wallop some sense back into him. But as long as he is subject to universal adulation, his vanity will swell to inhuman proportions until one day he bursts. And that day cannot be far off. Scorsese has made some wonderful films, such as KUNDUN (1997), MY VOYAGE TO ITALY (1999), and THE AVIATOR (2004). His love of music is very touching, and everyone appreciated his contribution to THE BLUES (2003). But when he tries the horror-thriller medium, as with CAPE FEAR (1991, a really terrible failure of a film, not worth reviewing) and this film, Scorsese descends to the depths of incompetence and uselessness. That is why Scorsese needs to be tied to a spanking-machine, because he is unruly and needs discipline. He needs to be kept away from these dark areas of the evil mind and restrained from manic indulgence, just as young boys used to have their hands tied up at night (see THE WHITE RIBBON) so as not to fiddle with themselves. Leonardo DiCaprio has worked with Scorsese before (superbly, in THE AVIATOR), and when offered this juicy part, where he is allowed to grit his teeth a great deal and show us how grown up he now is by leaping into action at the drop of a hat, squared-jawed and determined (the very essence, he imagines, of a cinema hero, in the hope that one day he might become Harrison Ford), he took it! No surprise! Actors and actresses accept parts! What else is new? Whether they are taking part in a wicked enterprise does not seem to occur to them, which must be why Jodie Foster agreed to do SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. So this dark film about an insane asylum on an island in Boston Harbour does not enhance the value of human existence, but rather adds to the forces of the dark side, and we gain nothing from it but a sterile titillation of the most vacuous kind. And not all the cleverness in the world can disguise the fact that this film is empty.","

"morrison-dylan-fan","2 August 2012","After having recently finished reading Dennis Lehane's smart,tense Gothic Horror mystery-Noir novel Shutter Island,my anticipation for seeing the film adaptation greatly increased when I found out who the director and cast were that are connected to this movie,which started to make me really looking forward to going on a holiday to the island.View on the film:Smartly focusing on the essential elements of Dennis Lehane's novel,screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis cleverly makes sure that the Neo- Noir and Horror elements of the plot stay evenly balanced,with Teddy's flashbacks to the last days he spent with his wife allowing Kalogridis to create some very strong macabre moments,whist Daniel's (played by a tense Leonardo DiCaprio) and Aule's (played by a fantastic ""by the book,sir"" Mark Ruffalo) increasingly dangerous search for the ""truth"" on Shutter Island allows Kalogridis to build a good Neo-Noir feel,as Teddy and Chuck get deeper in the murky waters surrounding the island.Although Kalogridis does not build the solid foundation which made Lehane's ""turning of the cards"" truly masterful,and also shockingly gets near to giving away the ""twist"" early on, Kalogridis is still able to get some ""kick"" from the ending,by including a number of moments,which initially look completely minor,before the film unleashes its ""surprise"" and makes those moments look like some of the most important sections in the movie.For Teddy's dreams,director Martin Scorsese shows an amazing eye for just using the right amount of CGI to make the scenes really unsettling,whilst never taking the easy option of completely going overboard with the CGI.Despite the film having an absolutely fantastic setting which looks like a near guarantee for the movie to be filled with thrills and chills,Scorsese unexpectedly shows a restrained side to his directing for most of the film,which despite having a misty feel never transformers into becoming a truly under the skin haunting atmosphere which would have made Shutter Island a place that you would never want to leave.","

"dave-sturm","21 February 2010","Acting? Top notch. Cinematography? Perfect. Grotesque images? In spades. Foreboding music? You bet. Gothic atmosphere? Ooo-eee-ooo.The problem here is the story and the way it is told. I had read Dennis Lehane's novel going in and knew the basic arc of the story and the big reveal at the end, but this version stuffs way too much into a relatively simple mystery story. Shutter Island could be ... THIS! Or it could be ... THAT! Or it could be ... SOME OTHER AWFUL THING! And why do we need World War II flashbacks? What do Nazis and Holocaust victims add to the story, except to give Scorcese a chance to show mournful starving Jews, a pile of bodies topped by a heartbreaking little dead girl clutching at her dead mother and an, admittedly masterful, tracking shot of Nazis being mowed down by righteous GIs. Take that, Quentin.And here's a small annoyance. As the GIs enter what is clearly stated as Dachau concentration camp, which is in Germany, we see the famous arch that says, ""Arbeit macht frei"" (work sets you free). Trouble is, that arch isn't at Dachau, it's at Auschwitz, which is in Poland. Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army. Why can't Scorcese leave well enough alone? Things are over amplified. You can't just show a Nazi commandant's office, it has to be full of blowing paper. You can't just have stormy weather, it has to be a raging hurricane. You can't just show a woman living in a cave, you have to be sure we see the canned rations and canteen of water that keep her alive. Things to marvel at, for sure, but ultimately distracting.After a while, it's hard to tell when U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leo DiCaprio) is hallucinating and when he is not. In one scene, he wakes up from a bad dream and immediately begins hallucinating ... or is it more of the bad dream? Hmm. One can almost hear Scorcese say, ""Hey, let's not just blow up a car, let's put Teddy's hallucinated wife and daughter into the explosion!"" Taken together, these things cause a lot of suspense to drain out of the movie and it ends up being a gorgeously made creep-out flick.","

"Medacakathareal","20 March 2010","The trailer for the film gives away far too much and essentially ruins what would otherwise be an effective twist.I've never been too fond of twist endings, save maybe a few of the twists from old Twilight Zone episodes but I felt the twist in this film really made the film entirely pointless.We spend most of the movie engrossed in a detective story with a few flashback puzzle pieces and are left to wonder how those fit into the twist we all know is coming. The fact we all the twist from the trailer means its basically only a matter of time.I left the theater feeling hollow and annoyed. What is the point of all this? What are they trying to say about crazy people? In the end Andrew (Teddy for most of the movie) is to be lobotomized, so the message is about how sometimes drugs and respecting patients doesn't work so let's carve them open? Rather than creating an expertly crafted detective story we instead get an obvious twist (even to those who turned the channel every time the trailer was on) that halts the story. I cared about Teddy's demons, wanted him to get off the island but you can't yank the character around into someone else and expect me to still care about him when everything he's been characterized as and experienced has been one big delusion.It was still an okay film... just apparently not my style of film.","

"dfranzen70","21 February 2010","Leonardo Dicaprio stars as a U.S. Marshal sent to a remote and forbidding insane asylum in 1954 to investigate the disappearance of a patient. As he proceeds, Teddy Daniels uncovers far more than he bargained for - or is it? In a movie in which nearly everything is actually something else, the audience is redirected too many times for this to be an effective thriller, and some gaping holes in the plot should relegate this to the dustbin in no time.We first see Marshal Daniels (Dicaprio) on the way to the island via ferry, with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo). Immediately, we size up our protagonist: prone to seasickness, a little grizzled, possibly wrestling with inner demons. Also has a prominent band-aid on his forehead, and as we all know any time a character shows up with a bandage and no explanation, that bandage will come into play later in the movie.The asylum, Ashecliffe Hospital, is run by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), a pipe-smoking medical reformer who nonetheless looks down his nose at everyone else. His right-hand man is the assistant warden, McPherson (John Carroll Lynch), who informs the marshals that they must surrender their guns before they can enter the grounds. Again, something this obvious means that the concept will come up later in the movie, and sure enough it does.Something doesn't quite add up about the missing patient, Rachel Solando. Solando apparently vanished from her room, barefoot, without anyone noticing, on an island. That is covered in rocky terrain. Daniels finds a note hidden under the floor tile that seems to indicate that there's an additional missing patient who's not accounted for. Further galivanting around the island simply unearths more and more facts and clues that don't make much sense. And then we find out that Daniels himself might be hiding something. He fits in very well with everyone else in this regard.The movie is appropriately shot (by Robert Richardson, who's won two Oscars): moody, unflinching, terrifying at turns, well matched to the setting. But the movie has too many problems to be wholly satisfying. During the movie, one of the characters informs Daniels that being declared insane means that anything you do afterwards can be held up as evidence of your insanity. That makes sense, of course, but the trouble is that that logic can be applied to anything in this movie as well, a sort of self-justification. I Call it lazy screen writing.And, honest to goodness, I still don't think Leonardo Dicaprio is much of an actor. His matinée-idol looks are already fading - he's got the head of Charlie Brown at this point - but his range hasn't really improved over the past decade or so. He seems to struggle with his reaction shots, and he doesn't have the gravitas necessary for such a heavy role. I'm supposed to believe he's a federal marshal? I'd have trouble believing he's dressed up as a marshal for Halloween. Here, he's supported by a very capable cast - particularly Kingsley, although he seems to be slumming it a bit, and Patricia Clarkson. But for the most part, his character is on his own, and Dicaprio flounders.Shutter Island is, at best, minor Scorcese, a movie that's high on mood and atmosphere but a little light on a plausible plot. There are too many moments that don't make complete sense when they happen and that can only be supported by the notion that someone - or everyone - is insane.","

"imagiking","13 March 2010","Shutter Island, the new film from Martin Scorsese, has a hell of a lot to live up to. Personally, I had great faith in the film and was quite looking forward to it. The premise seemed quite interesting and possessing of wonderful potential.And that it was: Leonardo DiCaprio is US Marshall Teddy Daniels, sent to investigate the disappearance of a prisoner from the eponymous institution for the criminally insane. Working through the stress of a recent tragedy, he falls deeper and deeper into the mysterious case, where everyone seems to be hiding something.When I first saw Teddy's partner Chuck, and heard in my head the words he was about to say (""You okay boss?""), I knew things were not going to go as well as I hoped. Predictability reigned supreme. From that clichéd 50s detective line to the ""twist"" ending, bearing all the subtlety and surprise of a loud and luminescent train, things were often painfully obvious. The beginning is annoyingly over-dramatic, the score astoundingly over the top. Plot-exposition-by-numbers soon follows, as well as the overstated oddness of this island. After a very flawed introduction, the film does turn in a better direction. The middle was far more enjoyable than what came before, winning me over somewhat with its developing strangeness. It's not long, however, before the clear signs are given and we see the ending about halfway into the film, making the rest rather a waste of time. We plummet dramatically into a worse third act than first. I was shocked at Marty's descent into intensive plot explanation, taking perhaps half an hour of drawn out dialogue followed by dramatisations of that very dialogue and making me feel as though he thought I was a child incapable of understanding what was happening. For goodness' sake, Ben Kingsley even unveils a drawn out explanation from beneath a velvet cover. Grow up Marty, and don't be so condescending. The movie also owes far more than it cares to admit to The Shining, desperately yearning to be the infinitely superior film for a good portion of its running time while adding the music of Cape Fear gone mad. My poor ears.Shutter Island is riddled with flaws. It is clunky, overly long, shamefully evident, unoriginal, inconsistent in quality and poorly derivative of a far more enjoyable film. There is enjoyment to be found, however, in the fun middle section and closing statement; one which did at least lend gravitas to its climax. A poor film it may be, but it is at least a fun one at that. Scorsese has underperformed here, though not entirely terribly.","

"thinker1691","19 June 2010","The Second World War was one great big mess and those who survived a visit to the Concentration Camps were doubly affected. Famed film director Martin Scorsese and novelist Dennis Lehane teamed to bring his book to the big screen. The movie, like the novel is called "" Shutter Island. "" The year is 1954 and two U.S. Marshalls Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are sent from the mainland to an offshore island for the criminally insane. The reason is simple, a violent and dangerous inmate Dolores Chanal (Michelle Williams) has somehow escaped the maximum prison and remains at large. The two Marshalles are introduced to Dr.Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) who seem very reluctant to divulge any pertinent information on any aspect of the place, patients or their protocol. With the warden (Ted Levine) watching their every move, it's difficult to proceed. However, with dogged skill, Daniels finally discovers much more than he's suppose too and finds himself the target of what he believes is a monstrous conspiracy involving Nazis, illegal experimental drugs and murder. The movie begins suspensively driven, shifts quickly into a dark mode and then flings the audience into the realm of the diabolical. All in all, the fast paced drama is another triumph for the team of De Caprio and Scoresese. Easilly recommended. ****","

"JoeyGreen","21 February 2010","Scorsese hit his peak with Raging Bull and it has been downhill ever since. Teaming up with Leo instead of keeping the franchise going with De Niro (OK, he's old but he can still act) was a major mistake. Gangs of NY? A snoozer except for Bill the Butcher; the Departed, overrated, now this turkey.My wife and I were laughing out loud at Marty's lame attempts to emulate the master, Alfred Hitchcock, at trying to ramp up the tension. It was embarrassing -- spiral staircases, gleaming knife, rocky cliffs, ad nauseum -- never once creating a genuinely believable moment. It was as though a modern artist was trying to repaint the Mona Lisa. This was all by-the-numbers.A few minutes into the movie, we need Teddy was nuts and hallucinating, and yet we had to endure two hours of sordid flashbacks, dead concentration camp kids, a dead wife who keeps reappearing throughout the movie saying the same thing over and over, and the usually overacting of De Caprio, who can't seem to utter a line without making a face of some sort. All I can remember is his dancing eyebrows and histrionics through a fake boston accident.Leo would have been a bit player in One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, but here he is the big star that somehow the entire island devotes 2 years, entire staff as well, trying to ""cure"" him of his insanity only to resort to lobotomy in the end. Now that's realistic. Certainly, asylums spent two years on each patient trying to reconstruct their personalities by everyone playing a different role to accommodate the needs of the nutcase. It would have been a lot easier to lock him in a padded cell and be done with it, but then there would have been no movie.Mr. Hitchcock, if he could, would roll over in his grave at this blatant and failed attempt at honorifics. Time for Marty to take his millions and play video games.","

The boss, Teddy, asks a lot of questions, but doesn't get a lot of answers. The story he is told makes it seem impossible for the patient to have vanished from her cell. We soon see things aren't what they seem and there is an even more dangerous patient on the lose.FINAL VERDICT: It's OK, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out what is going on.","

"oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx","17 March 2010","For me Shutter Island was revelatory, in sympathy with the protagonist Teddy Daniels, the Marshal who comes to investigate the mysterious McCarthy-era Shutter Island asylum, I experienced feelings associated with metanoia. This is the theoretical process whereby the mind, or more specifically the model by which one understands the world, reforms itself as a result of challenge and becomes uplifted after a period of apparent mental illness. The feeling that it culminates in is a realisation that everything you understood before is wrong. By the end of the movie I felt lifted out of myself, as in a moment of clarity.Shutter Island therefore seems to work the best when you associate with Teddy. If you do, you're forced into a deep introspection, where you realise how much of your persona is built out of coping strategies. The feelings it provoked in me were very personal, but I would expect that if the film ""worked"" for you they might be similarly cathartic. I felt I could feel how deluded I often am by depression, I felt how beautiful some of the people I know are, as if seeing them for the first time.Aside from this wellspring of emotion, the film has plenty to offer in visual terms. Mr Scorsese and director of photography Robert Richardson provide strange and beautiful images in the movie, a darkened chamber, pools of dripping light beneath an antique, coffered, barrel-vaulted ceiling; golden hair, and a golden locket mingling with red blood; a family room softly snowing ash. There were also some horrifying images, concentration camp scenes that have drawn flak from critics. I think though that if you reject the film because of this, as Pontecorvo's concentration-camp-set Kapò was rejected, you throw the baby out with the bath water.A big pitfall for twist movies can be the expositionary info-dump at the denouement, but for me it worked here, because I felt involved in the struggle for Teddy's soul.Good acting is to be found all over, sprouting in abundance, like the daffodils in Spring; Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo di Caprio I feel steal the show, though the jeep ride with Ted Levine's Warden is one of the most astonishing things I have seen in a cinema, pure dream fabric.I wonder if the choice of Penderecki and Ligeti in the soundtrack is a Kubrick homage (he used these both for The Shining). In any case the soundtrack choices are an triumphant. I was close to tears listening to a resetting of Dinah Washington singing ""This Bitter Earth"" over the credits, and I'm not prone to such behaviour.Obviously I can't recommend this film enough.","

"archiecm","27 March 2010","The movie is unrealistic. What Institution would have had the money to produce a fake scenario with a cast of hundreds, numerous rehearsals and time taken from their regular jobs to convince one patient his fantasies were just that. They could and would have lobotomized him instead or simply kept him in solitary. Lobotomies were de reguer at that point in our history. Ditto for shock treatments. And according to the last scene this is the second time in a year that the whole facility has gone through this charade to try to ""wake"" this guy up. Like I said, who's got the time and especially the money to devote to just this one patient? Never happen. Some of the scenes were intriguing. The actors were compelling in certain scenes. But the movie as a whole was a ridiculous and unrealistic film with the credo that, ""if we surprise you, (no matter how far-fetched), you'll like it.""","

"Simon_Says_Movies","10 March 2010","I often enjoy it when what some may call 'prestige' directors forte into what some may call 'mainstream' move-making for a film or two. You get the best of both worlds; a film palatable for a Friday night, and as well as weight behind the camera. Few would argue that Spielberg's War of the Worlds or Ron Howards Angels & Demons are their respective best work but I'm not one to throw on Citizen Kane over Bad Boys II when I simply want to relax after a day in the grind.The same can be said for Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. While I don't want to make unfair assumptions about how other filmmakers would have handled the material, his prowess behind the camera certainly adds some pizazz and gravitas to the material. Shutter Island is the third successful instance of a Dennis Lehane novel, after Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone, being brought to the big screen and here's to hoping this streak of winning adaptations continue. This time around we follow U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) as they investigate the disappearance of a mental patient from a stormy island penitentiary off the coast from Boston in 1954. The shifty resident doctor (played deliciously by Ben Kingsley) does not make things easy for the two as Teddy is haunted not only by the facility itself, but by past demons of his wartime traumas and the death of his wife years earlier.Revealing much more than that regarding the plot would an injustice to the viewer so I shall say no more. What I will reveal is that DiCaprio turns in another star performance and while I feel it may be lost in the shuffle of the year to come, it is an award worthy exploit. His character complexly navigates between instances of professional integrity and unhinged paranoia. Ruffalo is by all means good in his role but it is, to be blunt, unmemorable. Not for his acting but for how the character is written. The real star is the set design and art direction which never release its grim grip for the length of the film.There is nothing overtly terrible about Shutter Island only that there is nothing outwardly remarkable about it either. The middle portion sags before its fantastic conclusion and there are a few too many flashbacks and dream sequences all of which add up to a solid, but not great genre exercise. Contrary to the ominous aura of the film, the score utilized is far too brash for its own good; clanging and banging its way through the Gothic atmosphere. While I would not go as far as to create a direct comparison, it recalls the disastrous score from 2008's Blindness. It could have gone a long way to use more Drag Me to Hell style acoustics, which utilize everyday objects and sounds to eerie effect.As is the unfortunate case with many thrillers and horror flicks, I cannot see Shutter Island standing up to repeat viewings with much potency. I will not deny however its sinister mood and great performances kept me more than entertained for 120 minutes and with its complex and rewarding twists it is still the best movie of this young year.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com","

"Eumenides_0","14 April 2010","I watched Shutter Island a few hours ago and I'm shocked to imagine that I almost missed it on the theaters. The trailer made it look like a modern horror movie: full of silly jump scenes, dissonant music, grainy cinematography, fast editing. I found the trailer so disgusting to look at, I nearly missed the movie.Well, I'm glad I watched it after all, because I wouldn't hesitate to consider it a modern masterpiece. It's also the best Martin Scorsese movie I've seen by him since Casino.The movie, a mystery set in 1954, follows US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, as they arrive at Shutter Island, a desolate place that holds a mental hospital for the criminally insane. Their original mission is to find a patient who disappeared, but Teddy has a secret mission: he believes Shutter Island is keeping sinister secrets, involving experiments on the patients. And he took the mission to get on the island and gather evidence to prove it.To reveal more would spoil the movie.In recent years Martin Scorsese seems to have been making only Oscar bait - his historical epics, Gangs of New York and The Aviator were clear attempts at getting the prized statuette, and it's ironic that it was his least ambitious, more banal movie to date, The Departed, that finally got him an Oscar. But it seems that it released him from this obsession and he has gone back to making great movies without Oscar concerns. Shutter Island is his first movie in a long time to make a good combination of plot and character, and use pacing in an exciting way, drawing the viewer into the story slowly but hypnotically.Leonardo DiCaprio has improved a lot in recent years, taking more interesting projects. In Shutter Island he gives a great performance as Teddy, an ex-soldier who witnessed the liberation of Dachau, haunted by the horrors of the Holocaust, who became a US Marshall only to be hit by a tragedy in his own country. His face and body language, but especially his eyes, transmit the pain of a man who's seen too much and suffered too much and yet continues to cling to life. Although the movie starts as a mystery, it's in fact a character study of Teddy.The supporting cast is just as good: Mark Ruffalo is hit and miss for me, but here he hit it as Teddy's likable partner, Chuck. Ben Kingsley gives a great performance too as Dr. Cawley, a man who radiates nothing but caring for his patients and yet Teddy thinks there's something evil in him. Max Von Sydow, with less screen time than any of the others, is also perfect as a truly sinister doctor.The rest of the movie is in the hands of Scorsese's usual team: Thelma Schoonmaker, Dante Ferretti, Francesca Lo Schiavo and Sandy Powell. I loved the cinematography throughout the movie, every shot was so well framed, so elaborate, the movements so fluid and unusual. I was quite happy to learn it was Robert Richardson (Platoon, JFK, The Aviator) in charge of the cinematography: he's one of the best DPs working in Hollywood nowadays.Another aspect that captured my attention was the music; it seemed so fit for each scene I was amazed to discover none of it had been composed for the movie. I especially loved the use of Max Richter's music in it; he composed one of the best scores I've ever listened to - Waltz With Bashir - and his non-film music can be quite good too. The piece used, On The Nature Of Daylight, was one of my favorite tracks in the movie.Shutter Island is an exciting, tense, and heartbreaking movie. Leonardo DiCaprio made Teddy Daniels such a likable person, the ending might leave some people sad over his fate. It's not death, but this movie shows that there are things worse than death in this world. And perhaps that's the best praise I can give this movie, that it shows new types of horrors we're not accustomed to think about. For that, Martin Scorsese and everyone involved in Shutter Island deserve a lot of praise.","

"raulfaust","9 March 2011","You know, while reading this film's reviews you get to think it's the best 2010 movie. But after really watching, you get disappointed.The cast does it's job, the director as well. The suspense is well created, the atmosphere is tense and it's very intriguing. But the conclusion of Shutter Island is similar to the end we've already seen in a bunch of other movies, such as ""Identity"", ""The Others"" and ""Never talk to strangers"".I strongly wished the writers of this film were a little more daring and could have had more creativity to make it more original and amusing. But it's a good watch anyways.","

"trans_mauro","19 March 2010","...one can see the twist in the story miles away.SI is slow boring and not as smart as some of the reviewers think it it is. This film is one more of those films that question sanity and whose main character (in this case Leonardo di Caprio) is found to be living in an alternate reality. A person with half a brain would have seen that after the first 15 minutes. Well, all SI does is to jump back and forth from ""the realities"" experienced by Di Caprio's character at the beat of a dreadful and annoying musical score (it gave me a head ache...). To make things worse it ends in an ambiguous way, another gimmick to make the viewer question his own reality... not very original.SI tries hard to be a horror movie, to create an eerie atmosphere, to involve the spectator with a mystery and a drama that simply are not there. It fails poorly.SI is another example that Hollywood has run out of original ideas.","

"spelvini","20 February 2010","There's a certain betrayal that seems to occur between filmmaker and viewer when a psychological thriller on screen is suddenly revealed to be the madness of a character. Movies that trick an audience this way always seem to guarantee a particular anger from the audience for doing so. We only want the truth but when that truth is clouded by insanity, unless we know the rules, we resent being taken for a ride, especially in a film like Shutter Island which is ostensibly a 2-hour character study.When movies show us reality through a madman's eyes we are bound to follow the gnarly logic of that character, and with some actors this journey can be exciting and fascinating to experience. In Shutter Island however the character is suffering under the burden of personal psychosis and the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't fully justify the parameters of the characters' mental capabilities. Additionally there is no logical mooring for the story or character and the filmmaker must resort to increasingly shocking images to hold the viewer. This is problematic because we remain outsiders through the course of the story and are never fully able to experience viscerally the characters' needs.When we see images of a frozen mother and child at Dachau we are certain that director Martin Scorsese will use these dead bodies in a later image of shock for Teddy, and sure enough the dead come alive in a dream for the disturbed character and continue throughout the rest of the film to haunt the viewer as well.Like Pavlov's dog, Teddy salivates at the idea of getting back at the German nation by inflicting some sort of pain on Dr. Naehring played by Max von Sydow. As striking as many of these images are, they add up to more character definition as if the film was an excuse for the actions of this investigator played by Leo DiCaprio. What we keep wanting, after a good hour into the movie, is some real exposure of injustice that's being foisted on society and watch as Teddy puts the kibosh on those responsible and make the world a happier place.The world of Martin Scorsese is a darker place. The film is a promotional film for the advances of Psychological Treatment in the 1950s, and Scorsese's aesthetic betrays his own sense of justice, and that of the public at large. There is a concerted effort by Ben Kingsley's Dr. Cawley to voice the heart of the film that good humane treatment of mental patients leads to a better society but if that is the case then why not make the movie about him, and not about a psychotic detective.Novelist Dennis Lehane loves mystery. His novel ""Mystic River"" was adapted for the screen by Clint Eastwood and achieved blockbuster status due to its powerful psychological overtones. Another one of his books, ""Gone Baby Gone"" was adapted and directed by Ben Affleck as a debut directorial project in 2007 to great success. Both films have a strong connection to psychological motivation and an equally strong objective correlative that defines plot as character goal-fulfillment. Shutter Island as a twisted psychological story with the metaphorical images of insane asylum and derangement are the kinds of things that work in a textual story as a novel but do not translate ideally into a film without some compensation.Martin Scorsese likes the noir allure of the story as a detective yarn better than the possible alternative, that of a life-affirming tale about advances in psychiatry. The film utilizes all the tropes of film noir- detectives in Fedoras, shadowy hallways, suspicious doctors, mental disorder, dark foreboding stormy weather, but these elements are all supports for the fractured character of Teddy Daniels, and if we identify with him we have to feel that we are controlled by our own demons as he is driven by his demons.The film does have moments of humor which keep us involved in the character of Teddy Daniels, as in the way DiCaprio shows us how he is affected by the warm memory and sense of loss connected with Michelle Williams' Dolores. Especially affecting is a moment late in the movie when Daniels uses his tie to create a car bomb while apologizing to his wife's' accompanying specter about the ""ugly"" clothing accessory she had given him.On the TV show ""Dallas"" that aired from 1978 to 1991 an entire season was developed around a series of events that essentially brought an end to all of the characters and the great Ewing Empire. When toward the end of the season viewers were up in arms about the complete erosion of the bond they had developed over the years with the world of JR and all the machinations of the Texas night-time drama, the last episode revealed that the preceding events had all been a bad dream of one of the characters- this allowed the producers a ""get-out-of-jail"" card after being given the death sentence by their viewing public. Shutter Island has a similar effect but no renewed season to win back all those who watch disheartened as the screen fades to black.Considering the $12-dollar price tag for movie tickets in New York, this film will look better on disc with additional commentary from the director and actors- watch it then.","

"TxMike","29 July 2010","The story is set in 1954, within easy memory of World War 2. While it is in color, but with subdued colors, it evokes memories of the 1940s and 1950s film noir genre.A prisoner named Rachel has escaped and two US Marshals are on the ferry to Shutter Island, dispatched to help investigate the incident. Things become even more complicated when a storm, which they refer to as a hurricane, hits.Leonardo DiCaprio is certainly good and convincing as US Marshal Teddy Daniels. The Marshal with him, and who refers to Teddy as ""boss"", is Mark Ruffalo as Chuck Aule.In the institution are Ben Kingsley as the head doctor, Dr. John Cawley. Another doctor is Max von Sydow as Dr. Jeremiah Naehring. Ted Levine with his ominous voice is the Warden. John Carroll Lynch, who was Marge's husband in ""Fargo"", is Deputy Warden McPherson.As Teddy gets inside the gates of the institution we notice that his treatment by the staff is a bit unusual. Yet when he requests information, or a meeting with others, it is usually provided for him, but it appears with some reluctance.This is a very good mystery, and one where seeing it a second time can give the viewer a whole different perspective.MAJOR SPOILERS follow, where I explain my take on the whole movie. There probably are other explanations that are plausible. Please read no further if you have not seen the movie.This is an example of a story with an unreliable narrator, otherwise it cannot make sense. Daniels is that unreliable narrator. He tells others that his wife died from smoke inhalation in their apartment, but later we find out that is a made-up memory to mask what really happened. We also find out that Daniels isn't is real name, it also has been made up to mask unpleasant memories, his real name is Laeddis. His wife was Michelle Williams as Dolores Chanal, we only see her in flashbacks. After the fire in their apartment they moved to a Lake House, where Daniels (Laeddis) comes home to find she had drowned their children, and in a fit of passion he killed her. He is not a US Marshal, he has been a patient for the criminally insane for two years. In a last-ditch effort to get him to recognize and live with reality, his ""visit as a Marshall"" was set up, and his partner was really his primary psychiatrist. In the end it didn't work, he was still not dealing with reality and what must have been an accepted procedure in 1954, was last seen headed for the lighthouse where a partial lobotomy was to be preformed. In the alternate explanation, he DID realize who he really was and acted like he didn't in effect choosing the lobotomy because he couldn't live with the reality.","

"evanston_dad","28 July 2010","Martin Scorsese's Gothic thriller works overtime to wring chills from its creepy setting (an institution for the criminally insane) and mysterious plot twists. But despite, or maybe because of, all of the obvious and heavy-handed directorial flourishes (moody film noir lighting, constant rain and thunder, a screechy score that announces every emotion you should be feeling before you're allowed to feel it), the film is surprisingly unengaging and, even more surprisingly given its stylish director, fairly pedestrian.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a federal marshal who travels with his partner (Mark Ruffalo) to the eponymous island to investigate the disappearance of an inmate. They butt up against uncooperative administrators (Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow) and uncover a possible conspiracy that involves inmates being used in mind-control experiments similar to the ones inflicted by the Nazis on concentration-camp Jews. Throughout, we're treated to dream-like flashbacks in which we learn things about DiCaprio's past and help us understand the personal vendettas driving his behavior. Everything builds to a surprise plot twist that's meant no doubt to make us question everything we've watched up to that point in the film but which frankly didn't come as that much of a surprise.The film is chock-full of recognizable faces in brief cameos: Michelle Williams, Jackie Earle Haley, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, Ted Levine and most notably Patricia Clarkson. But despite the film's high production values and A-list cast, it's hard to believe that someone as talented and capable as Martin Scorsese made this. It's not a bad movie, but it's an awfully mediocre one. There's a reason a film by such a high-profile director was dumped in theatres in the dead of winter.Grade: B","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","24 February 2010","I knew I had to watch this the moment I saw the trailer, I went in with high expectations, and this still blew me away. Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York... OK, not Cape Fear, but that was a mistake from day one(it didn't need a remake), the talent involved notwithstanding... I've loved everything(with the one aforementioned exception) that I've seen by Martin Scorsese, and this, while it might at first appear excessively mainstream, is another example. This is beautifully shot and edited, and the lighting is just astonishing. The look is amazing. This also has outstanding FX, though they are clearly not the focus, only a tool to tell the story, which is rather brilliantly put together. In general this is immensely well-written; the dialog is clever and there are numerous memorable lines, the script is smart and every character is credible, well-developed and psychologically accurate. The acting is flawless. Levine gets an unforgettable speech that he delivers impeccably, Lynch does his ""there's something funny about that guy..."" thing perfectly, and the entire principal cast are spot-on. The score is grand and really helps set the tone and the mood, if it is arguably over-dramatic in a place or two. This is quite creepy, terrifying and exciting. There is plenty of bloody, at times gory, violence and disturbing content, relatively infrequent strong language, brief nudity and a sexual description. I recommend this to any fan of the director and thrillers that mess with your head. 10/10","

"onelyfunitd","28 August 2010","An avid movie-goer such as myself always steps into a Scorsese movie expecting benchmark cinema and why not?The man has raised the bar time and again.Having said that,Shutter Island is an exceptionally well-made movie staying true to its plot and premise throughout.But once the credits roll, deep down you will feel, that there is a fine line between ""Good"" and ""Great"" and it is that line which this movie fails to cross.Scorsese has previously excelled in psychological thrillers when he gave us ""Taxi Driver"" and made Robert DeNiro a legend.Shutter Island, on the other hand is slightly different,closer to Hitchcock and the likes of ""Psycho"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"".Set in Post WWII America it explores the story of U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), who has been assigned the investigation of the disappearance of a patient on Shutter Island's Ashecliffe Hospital.He is partnered by Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo).The hospital is headed by Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), who is shown to believe in radical techniques to treat the mental patients instead of adopting the barbaric and sinister practices,namely Lobotomy, which were in practice during that era.From here, weird occurrences in and around the hospital coupled with a peek into Teddy's troubled past slowly blur the line between what's real and what's not and lead towards a gripping finale.Scorsese gets most of it spot-on.The plot is tight and the casting perfect.Cinematography is top-notch creating a sense of macabre and desolation.The score too,lends to the eerie atmosphere.There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you hooked and confused till the very last piece of the jigsaw is revealed ,rendering the entire movie a worthwhile experience.The movie hits jackpot as far as the performances are concerned.DiCaprio delivers his best performance till date, and yes,I mean better than Inception.The movie revolves around him and its a stellar act from him;perfectly nuanced,subtle and yet very sharp.He portrays contrasting traits,almost contradictory;shrewd yet vulnerable;keen yet hesitant and its in the uneasy gray between black and white where he successfully manages to color himself.Ben Kingsley is a delight to watch.His persona brings to the movie a sense of haunting and foreboding which it would have otherwise lacked.The rest of the supporting cast are fine too,especially Michelle Williams, who,playing a manic depressive, delivers a short yet chilling act.But then where does Shutter Island fall short?It does actually.In more ways than one.The script,though well-written, has its share of loopholes.DiCaprio's character and the reason for his insanity is never quite established.Neither do we ever come to know why his wife lost it one fine summer morning, and what exactly propelled her to committing murder.Besides, there are numerous sequences,which in hindsight seem unnecessary as their connection to the plot is never fully revealed.Especially the sequences of Teddy's dreams pertaining to his military exploits do not add much to the story except for telling us that he hallucinates about his family a lot!All of that not withstanding, Shutter Island is an entertaining watch.It is fast,well-acted and well made.Its a handsome tribute to the noirish productions of the 50's and 60's and stands tall and strong among the plethora of the mediocre which we are regularly subjected to.It does not disappoint.But then Scorsese never does.Does it leave you impressed?Perhaps.Amazed?Maybe. Awed? Not quite.","

"SimonJack","10 January 2019","""Shutter Island"" provides early clues that something is amiss with the lead character, Teddy Daniels. And that leads one to think that the mystery has a twist that is different than what the film purports to be about. I didn't read Dennis Lehane's novel on which the film is based. But, if he wrote it in the way this film portrays the story, it had to be a difficult read to follow. Flashbacks are a nice (and convenient) tool in storytelling and motion pictures, but they should only be used sparingly. Otherwise, they can distract from the story. In this case, their frequency and disconnectedness soon wear the film out and tire the viewer.I watched this film in the theater when it came out. I watched it again recently, and have a less enthusiastic response. I particularly enjoy good mysteries. The when, and how, and who, and why of a good suspense or crime story can be gripping and hold one's attention and interest. But these psychological thrillers sometimes muddle the plot and leave one wondering if a crime actually happened. So, the mystery isn't in solving a crime so much as it is in finding out if one was even committed at all.That's the sort of feeling one gets with this film. Then, it has elements that may seem like red herrings. The idea of Communist insurrectionists, plotters against the government, and some other items might be intended as red herrings, but they seem to be more overkill in the makeup of a crazy character.The use of so many flashbacks is probably necessary to arrive at the conclusion of the film. But they ignore the usual aspects of good movies and storytelling. So, instead of a tight plot this film seems to be a collection of different stories and random scenes and incidents tossed together with techniques to otherwise tantalize an audience. That may be very convenient for Hollywood, but it doesn't smack of superb mystery storytelling and filming.The acting is good all around and can't be faulted. Of course, the ruse of the film can raise many questions. Did the hospital use real inmates to role-play with the delusional Teddy Daniels? If so, how could professional health people justify that? If they didn't use real inmates, then they just happened to have many other folks around who would like to role-play in an asylum for the criminally insane.Unfortunately, psycho thrillers of this sort don't have to answer questions like that. Or make any sense at all. Real mysteries should allow people to rely on their senses and common sense otherwise. While I do enjoy such films from time to time, when they go this far off the track of good mystery telling, they go to another genre. They still involve crime but become more horror stories than human drama. And, then, the elements of the story don't have to fit or even make sense.The use of flashbacks seems to be the modern Hollywood and fiction writers' technique for getting around the historical tenets of good writing and storytelling. So, plot, plot, plot (as in solid story development) becomes plod, plod, plod (as in toss things together and hurry them along to be done with it). Give me a good old-fashioned Agatha Christie or Dashiell Hammett mystery any day.","

"zardoz-13","21 February 2010","Oscar-winning film director Martin Scorsese's latest movie ""Shutter Island"" with Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, and Mark Ruffalo, qualifies as his worst epic since ""Boxcar Bertha"" in 1972. Mind you, Scorsese received an Academy Award finally in 2007 for his absorbing Bostonian undercover crime thriller ""The Departed."" Previously, he missed bagging the bronze statuette for ""Raging Bull"" in 1981, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" in 1989, ""Goodfellas"" in 1991, ""The Age of Innocence"" in 1994, ""Gangs of New York"" in 2003, and ""The Aviator"" in 2005. Based on ""Mystic River"" author Dennis Lehane's 2003 bestselling psycho-thriller, ""Shutter Island"" constitutes a masterpiece of art direction, set design, cinematography, computer-generated special effects and top-notch acting. Nevertheless, you'll hate this gimmicky claptrap as soon as Scorsese and ""Alexander"" scenarist Laeta Kalogridis trot out their mind-boggling eleventh hour revelation! Talk about getting the rug yanked out from under your feet! Indeed, Scorsese seems to be channeling Alfred Hitchcock of ""Vertigo"" and ""North by Northwest"" during the first half of this portentous two-hour and eighteen minute melodrama before he shifts gears and imitates director M. Night Shyamalan of ""The Village"" in the last 20 minutes. Contrived and complicated from the start, this gloomy Gothic mystery thriller about a Houdini-like escape from a Federal maximum security asylum for the criminally insane, which resembles Alcatraz in Boston Harbor, is as delusional as a dog chasing its tail. Visually, ""Shutter Island"" could pass muster if it had stuck to its fairly predictable police procedural plot. Unfortunately, Scorsese weaves quite a tale that takes some strange turns before the bottom falls out. People that hate movies about elaborate mind games that lead them by the nose through a maze and then surprise them with a bad ending won't enjoy ""Shutter Island."" Meantime, audiences scavenging for visceral shocks to chill themselves are going to be sorely disappointed.""Shutter Island"" opens in 1954 in the Boston Harbor Islands as a storm is brewing offshore. Hard-boiled World War II veteran Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio of ""Titanic"") and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo of ""The Last Castle"") are U.S. Federal Deputy Marshals who have been assigned to investigate the mysterious disappearance of an inmate patient at Ashecliffe Asylum. Ashecliffe occupies an island of its own, like Alcatraz Prison, and its terrain is both craggy and forbidding. A bald-headed, pipe-smoking Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley of ""Fifty Dead Men Walking"") welcomes our gumshoe heroes to the island. Ashecliffe is more than an asylum; it is a hospital and a laboratory. Cawley lets Teddy and Chuck know from the start that he favors drugs over lobotomy. He struggles to bring moral order and peace to the troubled inmates, most of whom are murderers. Cawley has summoned the Marshals because a convicted psychopathic killer, Rachel (Emily Mortimer of ""The Pink Panther 2""), has vanished from her cell. Rachel is a murderess who drowned her three children. Deputy Warden McPherson (John Carroll Lynch of ""Grand Torino"") has dozens of uniformed guards out turning over rocks while all this is transpiring. Teddy is just recovering from the voyage to the island. He suffers from seasickness. Cawley offers him aspirin. According to Cawley, when the attendant locked Rachel into his cell, he locked her in from the outside. When the Marshals scour Rachel's room, all they find is a cryptic note about 'the law of 4.' Moreover, Rachel left behind both pairs of shoes, and the terrain is far too treacherous for her to negotiate it without footwear. Deputy Warden McPherson points out that swimming under the current circumstances was out of the question. The currents would have driven her body back ashore. Meanwhile, Teddy and Chuck are livid with indignation when they learn Cawley let the doctor treating Rachel take his long overdue vacation at the genesis of an investigation. Essentially, Teddy and Chuck spend most of their time interrogating the doctors, the staff, and the patients. Teddy wants to scrutinize the personnel records of everybody that dealt with Rachel. Cawley refuses to open the books because the information is confidential. Initially, since neither senior psychotherapist Dr. Naehring (Max Von Sydow of ""The Seventh Seal"") nor Cawley will allow Teddy to examine the personnel records. Eventually, Teddy discovers that Rachel could have slipped past one attendant when he went to the restroom. During their wanderings around the island, Teddy and Chuck get caught in a bad storm that forces Cawley and company to mobilize the staff and patients for an emergency. Our heroes wind up drenched to the skin, and Teddy resigns himself to staying on the island since the storm prevents their departure. ""Shutter Island"" doesn't look as bad as its plot is. Scorsese creates a palatable sense of paranoia, and the atmosphere simmers with tension. Early long shots of the ferry penetrating a fog bank on its way to the island reminded me of the ship in ""King Kong"" approaching Skull Island. Unfortunately, ""Shutter Island"" simmers but never comes boils. Despite ""JFK"" lenser Robert Richardson's incredibly flavorful cinematography and long-time Scorsese editor Thelma Schoonmaker's brisk cutting, this film takes too long to unfold and its payoff doesn't equal the time spent conjuring it up. A major flaw for any Hollywood movie is the absence of a sympathetic hero for whom we can root. The Leonard DiCaprio protagonist may generate a modicum of sympathy, but he lacks charisma. Nobody in this movie is remotely likable, especially the eerie Dr. Naehring. Naehring and Teddy have an intimate moment in the hallway and Naehring gets a taste of his own medicine. Moments like that aren't enough to redeem this potboiler. Altogether, ""Shutter Island"" amounts to utter hokum.","

"onepotato2","24 February 2011","From the opening seconds of this movie, it is dismaying to observe that a) this is clearly going to be the type of movie that hinges on a big twist, and that... b) Scorsese hasn't even been able to disguise that! It's clear in less than 2 minutes that Teddy Daniels (!) is an unreliable narrator; and Mark Ruffalo's character (who has precious little to do) is obviously only there to query Teddy and keep him talking, to relay his viewpoint as a narrative workaround; until the actual truth can be revealed at some arbitrary moment. I got news for you Marty; That is simply not interesting enough, and no amount of flashy technique will help. On top of that the story arc is indecipherable. We're asked to ingest very familiar ""startling"" developments from the very start, and about every five minutes after that. So none of them seem terribly important.Scorsese is not assisted in this effort by a thoroughly mediocre Leonardo DiCaprio who can barely disguise his ambition to join the lineage of Scorsese's tough guys; no matter how much he doesn't fit the mold. DiCaprio can barely convince a viewer he's an adult, let alone a tough one. Not since Tobey Maguire appeared in 'The Good German' has an actor been this out of his depth. Given the pedigree of all involved, you'd think someone would have figured out this stinker had no potential. There is no merit to be found in this pre-digested, overproduced dud. There is nothing to sustain this irrelevant trip through the machinery again. Sometimes in the pursuit of thrills and and innovative imagery in an effort to be interesting, it's a good idea to just stop what you're doing and be interesting.","

"Matt_Layden","20 February 2010","After the disappearance of one of the patients on Shutter Island, two Marshalls are assigned to the case and figure out what's going on. The only problem is that the people working there aren't really helping, and weird things start happening. Scorsese and my favourite genre? Instant win. The film is so masterfully crafted and well shot that it almost feels too good to be a part of this genre. Yet the script and theme fits perfectly. Yes, I knew the ending when they first showed the trailer ages ago, but that did not spoil the intrigue and suspense this film had. There were even a few surprises added on which was nice. Dicaprio is again, on his game. He pulls out crazy very well. It's not a spoiler that he goes a little crazy while investigating, it's all over the trailers. Added to the cast of characters if Mark Ruffalo, he does his best as the sidekick, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as eerie doctors , Elias Koteas in creepy make-up in one scene and a scene stealing Jackie Earle Haley.The film has it's Kubrick feel here and there, but it's Scorsese's stamp on it. It doesn't reach the heights of his previous efforts, but it's still better than 90% of the stuff that's out there. Scorsese knows this genre well enough to know where to pull the strings. The music is a key part in this and the restriction of jump scares shows that this is a well done film that wants to focus more on it's story, than to scare the audience. That being said, the film is not scary, but it does make you feel uneasy at times. When they go to Ward C, you can't help but feel the hair on your neck stand up as they search the halls.The twist is obvious, but the unravelling of everything is interesting enough to keep your attention. At times I did question myself, but in the end I knew I was right. Scorsese is able to chip away piece by piece the lead character's sanity to make the film work. Some people may feel cheated, others will like it. I found myself liking it, even if some of it is a bit out there.Shutter Island is one of the better films you'll probably see this year, it's no masterpiece and it tends to be a the long side of the running time, but it works.","

"tigerfish50","28 July 2010","A pair of detectives arrive at a fog-bound island where a dangerous female patient has mysteriously disappeared from her cell in a mental asylum. 'Shutter Island' crudely announces its grandiose delusions as the soundtrack blares the two men are entering a world of mystery and danger. Unfortunately it's also signaling the introduction of a tired collection of generic characters, wasted talent, mundane screen writing and melodramatic directing. The plot's big twist is obvious within the first 15 minutes, after which it plods relentlessly on to the 'surprise' denouement. All suspense having drained away at an early stage - something of a drawback in a suspense film - there's little to hold an audience's interest, so the film stagnates like a bloated whale.Since artists frequently steal ideas from one another, it shouldn't be a serious problem that the basic concept has been taken from a much earlier German film - only that it has been re-imagined in such a prosaic manner. The core idea is a clever conceit, but it requires subtle handling which seems utterly beyond Scorcese. It's difficult to remember another mystery thriller with Shutter Island's rich production values resulting in such a desperate state of boredom.","

The cast is amazing. It's a great stylish noir at the start. It's dark. It's creepy. It has a very weird vibe. There is a twist and it's very unsatisfying. I was buying into the movie but it pulls the rug from under me. It feels like the writer cheated and breaks any connection from the first half. I won't even comment on any believability or reasonableness of the twist. It was well on its way to a great movie. It's a small disappointment of what could have been.","

"sme_no_densetsu","24 July 2016","Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" is based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, author of ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone, Baby, Gone"", among others. The story revolves around a missing persons case at an isolated hospital for the criminally insane circa 1954.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshall sent to investigate the disappearance. However, he has already formulated his own hypothesis about the incident, one that involves secret government testing. The clues steadily accumulate, often creating more questions than answers, all the while ratcheting up the tension until we reach the final, climactic revelation.DiCaprio does a good job of carrying the film in what develops into a challenging, multi-faceted role. He is given strong support from the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Michelle Williams among several other notables in smaller roles. All in all, a talented ensemble cast.Scorsese's direction is as sharp as ever and he creates a number of memorable scenes. Frequent collaborator Robbie Robertson (of The Band fame) supervised the music, selecting existing pieces, some of which are quite striking. Multiple Oscar winners Dante Ferretti (production design) & Robert Richardson (cinematography) were also key contributors to the movie's atmosphere & authenticity.Having watched ""Shutter Island"" a couple of times now I feel that I have a better appreciation of the film's intricacies. Subtle touches that went unnoticed the first time around now take on new meanings with foreknowledge of the mystery's resolution. I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed by the story's conclusion on my initial viewing but the fact that the movie stands up to repeated viewings is a testament to the quality of its construction. Ultimately, ""Shutter Island"" certainly deserves to be seen once but I feel that a second viewing is key to experiencing everything that the movie has to offer.","

"ofumalow","18 February 2010","Of course this is impeccably produced and acted (though DiCaprio here might be a matter of taste), but it's a pretty long slog in which not enough happens and the resolution isn't worth the wait. The supernatural elements hinted at by advance materials turn out to be nonexistent. Worse, this is a throwback to 1940s/50s Hollywood feature in that (HERE COMES THE SPOILER) various action and intrigue happens for the majority of the film...then the final reel is spent with some psychiatrist or other figure of authority explaining at length ""Well, what REALLY happened previously was just an elaborate and implausible charade designed by us to induce a healing repressed-memory catharsis in our patient! Now all is well! Blah blah blah blah...."" That ending NEVER worked (even in ""Psycho""), usually coming off as a con job and turning everything before it into one big red herring. Which is just what happens here. There are good performances by Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley (the latter two just getting one big scene each). Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams and Max Von Sydow are in a fair number of scenes yet get pretty much wasted in generic narrative-device roles. The movie is of course well produced, designed, shot, et al. But you know something is wrong when you're watching a supposedly terrifying thriller and midway you think ""Gee that 'creepy' island setting is attractive! I'll bet that would make a nice vacation spot!"" I realize even Martin Scorcese has to do one for the box office every so often, but this uninspired genre piece (with a story more contrived and less resonant than the prior Dennis Lahane ones adapted for ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"") feels like a marking-time exercise for everyone involved.","

"fallyhag","13 March 2010","Either I am very clever or this was rubbish. I had the so called twist sussed within 5 mins of the film starting. It was just so painfully obvious that it had me doubting whether I had it right or not. But sadly there was no clever story writing...it really was that obvious. Don't watch this and expect a Sixth Sense ending.The editing was awful and the scenes were choppy. This movie was a blooper fest...full of scenes that just didn't join together.This is probably the hardest review I have written on IMDb because the film bored me. I just didn't care about the ending. From the very start til the end I pretty much knew I had it figured out so I didn't really care about all the pointless scenes in-between.When the end finally came I was glad I didn't care because my intelligence had been assaulted by another ""Bobby waking up in the shower"" ending mastered by the cult TV series ""Dallas"". All my watching was pointless because you were hit with a dumbed down ending that was partly explained by some poor dialogue.Some scenes were done OK (concentration camp) but some were just so green screen (rock climbing). If you are a fan of Cluedo then have a look at this but if you want a great film with a original ending then stay clear.As for the IMDb rating...another example of this website being managed by the film PR hype team. Never in a million years does this film deserve such a high rating. Probably the worst over inflated rating yet.Cant recommend...there are better things to spend your money on.","

"the-movie-guy","19 February 2010","(Synopsis) In 1954, U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are assigned to investigate the escape of a patient at the federal maximum security hospital/prison for the criminally insane located on Shutter Island. Once on the island, they find that the hospital and prison staffs aren't really cooperating with their investigation. It seems that the staff is hiding a big secret and Teddy is going to uncover it. Teddy believes that if he can see the records that he would break the case. In the meantime, the island is hit by a hurricane, and more dangerous patients escape and must be captured. This gives Teddy and Chuck the opportunity to check out some of the buildings to which they had been denied admission. Teddy finds the answer he was looking for.(My Comment) Shutter Island has an eerie atmosphere with flashbacks to the concentration camp at Dachau and haunting dreams throughout the entire movie. At times, you will wonder what is real and what is not. Then you will reach a point where you don't care. I started looking at my watch wanting it to be over. If you are a Leonardo fan and decide to see it, you will see that he does a good job of playing the character, but the creepy storyline is disappointing and is only good enough as a B movie. It will not take you very long to figure out the plot, especially, when you are inside Teddy's head. Overall, this movie is dreary and totally depressing.

"meeza","10 April 2010","Welcome to my Punner Island where all your pun dreams can come true! Of course I am going to punhabit my review of Director Martin Scorsese's brilliant ""Shutter Island"" as I do to all of my reviews. ""Shutter Island"" is not associated with the documentary based on every time that Paris Hilton opens her mouth, that one is called ""Shut-her Island"". OK, I will focus on ""Shutter Island"" before you guys think I belong on ""Shut-him Island"". Leonardo Dicaprio, collaborating with Scorsese for the fourth time, stars as Teddy Daniels; a 1950's U.S. Marshall who travels to Shutter Island to investigate a case of a missing patient. The island is primarily comprised of a hospital for the criminally insane. Sounds crazy ha? OK, sorry. Moving right along Teddy's marshall partner is Chuck, played by the reliable Mark Ruffalo. Teddy was a soldier in World War II and played a big part in rescuing Holocaust victims in a Nazi concentration camp. He is a recent widower whose wife accidental death still haunts him as he keeps having hallucinations of her. In the hospital for the criminally insane, they are met by numerous peculiar characters who do not help Teddy & Chuck much with the investigation; and I am not primarily referring to the patients also. I really cannot indulge more in providing you plot lines of ""Shutter Island"" because that would have me institutionalized in the hospital for the spoilerly insane, they have that? It is not insane to state that Leonardo DiCaprio's masterful performance should garner him another Best Actor Oscar nomination. The supporting performances of the film were also sanely proficient. Besides Ruffalo's fine work, I was psyched with the stellar performances of legendary actors Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as the hospital's primary psychiatrists, Kingsley playing the head mental honcho. The up-and-coming Emily Mortimer and the always stupendous Patricia Clarkson were scene-stealing in their brief performances as a couple of zany Rachel patients. Michelle Williams was not spectacular in her work as Teddy's deceased wife Dolores, but I would not say she was ""dead in the water"" also with her moderately commending performance. Kudos also goes out to veteran character actors John Carroll Lynch and Jackie Earle Haley for their powerful supporting work; Lynch playing a head guard and Haley playing a loony patient held at the hospital's ""critical psyche condition"" ward. The film's cinematography and art direction were vivid enough to also be called as Oscar nominees at next year's show. Laeta Kalogridis' twisting screenplay based on Dennis Lehane's novel made me ""twist & shout"" with literary pleasure. But who is crazy and daring enough to put all of this together- the one and only highbrow eyebrow maestro, Mr. Martin Scorsese. His daring direction of ""Shutter Island"" does not depart from the fact that Scorsese is still at the top of his game. So take that surreal cinematic voyage to the bizarre but worthwhile ""Shutter Island"". ***** Excellent","

"thunderfoot1812","23 February 2010","Summary: This is bad movie. Don't waste your time or your money on it. There was not a single convincing, or memorable, scene in the whole two-plus hours. There was not a single character to care much about. Most egregious is that this is a suspense film with almost no suspense. The movie was full of clichés -- but virtually every one of them was handled without the grace that made them clichés in the first place. The ending was predictable. The plot was stupid. The music was not the least bit memorable. On the good side? Hmmm, I suppose the cinematography was very nice, and there was a lot of technique (mostly ineffective) with the cameras. Oh, and I liked the double-basses playing the fog-horn motif.In the elevator in the garage on the way back to my car, a couple was complaining about a movie they had just seen. ""What the h..l was THAT?"" ""I don't know dear. What a stupid movie."" ""I can't believe what a mess it was!"" and so on. I asked them what movie they had just seen: Shutter Island. We agreed with each other as they left the elevator: ""Hitchcock, except without anything good in it."" I will now do my best to pan this movie without producing any spoilers. However if you want to be *absolutely* certain to enjoy the ""suspense"" in all possible aspects then don't read any farther.Suspense? This movie certainly falls in the category of Suspense. Except, er, the movie has almost no suspense to it. There was no rhythm to the sequencing of shots, no building of tension, no small releases. The whole movie was flat, like watching a collection of skits pasted together. Alas, despite his success with Cape Fear (which was much more literal), Scorsese just seems to have no feel at all for Hitchcock-style suspense.Plot? The plot for this movie is both trite, and baroque. As narrative fiction goes it is about on the level of movies made from video games, except they don't bother to pretend. (Hey, for that matter, Silent Hill had a better plot than this movie did.) No part of this movie, not even a single one of the scenes, was believable. Most of it was just absurd. In the interest of no spoilers I have to tread lightly here. Scorsese might argue that he was trying to represent a particular plot device, but boy did THAT ever fall flat. Don't expect to make much sense, either, of the bits and pieces snatched from the real story in the original book. Plenty of scenes could have been dropped without the slightest ding to THIS mess of a plot.How trite? Nazi doctors, concentration camp memories, ""mysterious"" psychiatrists, ghostly presences, all of the most hackneyed and ineffective type. Let's see: the spiral staircase from The Haunting of Hill House, the Boogey-man from Silence of the Lambs, the shower from Psycho... need I go on? And, too bad, the list of trite / iconic references here is more interesting to ponder than the actual boring manifestations of them in the movie.Horror? I am not sure how, but Scorsese managed to make eerie, dripping, insane-asylum corridors not the least bit eerie or menacing, violent, criminally-insane killers on the loose not the least bit scary, or interesting, menacing psychiatrists with drugs in syringes not the least bit terrifying.Character? Sorry. Not a single character was convincing or interesting. There was no chemistry between DiCaprio and Ruffalo, no sparks flying between DiCaprio and Kingsly. The great love of DiCaprio for his wife was entirely cardboard. The ooky prison-guards looked great for about five seconds and then went absolutely nowhere. What a disappointment from the guy who brought us all these rich characters in, say, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, and Taxi Driver (""Stop a car at a hundred yards -- put a bullet right through the engine block!""). The actors had nothing to work with in this movie.Engagement? Hmmm. If you can't manage to involve your audience with Nazi death-camp images, and children being murdered, you've got to admit that is pretty lame. But, this bomb manages to make both of these devices and many others sterile and void of any emotion. You also don't care about the wronged do-gooders locked away in an insane asylum, the hero of the story, or his side-kick...O.K., so maybe it gets two or three stars out of ten, but the hype is just too annoying for this weak effort from an excellent director.This movie was just dumb. If you believe the hype and go to see it anyway before word gets around, don't say I didn't warn you.","

I promise you however, it's not confusing at all. It's still a plot that's easy enough to understand and the twists and turns aren't overwhelming or overdone. The ending is just a masterpiece as well, I can honestly say I never once expected it to end in that direction and I'm so glad it did because it was a perfect end to the whole viewing experience.Special mention to the performances of Leo and Mark as well, both did superb and I can't imagine anyone else doing as well as they did.I know it sounds like I'm just brown nosing the film and nothing else, but personally I don't see any real negatives in the movie.

"ferguson-6","20 February 2010","Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh yes, the psychological thriller is my favorite movie genre. Not sure what that says about me. There are so few good ones, at least since Alfred Hitchcock passed on. Director Martin Scorsese often includes some psychological warfare in his films, but with ""Shutter Island"", he leaps feet first into the world of the criminally insane.This is a very difficult film to comment on because it is crucial that the viewer watch with a clean slate ... in other words, don't let someone toss out some spoilers if you plan to see the film. All I will say regarding the story is that it's fun to watch and my brain was working non-stop the whole time (that's a good thing!). Scorcese uses many different camera angles, close-ups and bright red to go with the island storm. The film has some of the style of his Cape Fear, but even more darkness to the story, as here, EVERY character is a bit off center.Scorsese has, as usual, assembled an excellent cast. Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead as Teddy. His partner is played by Mark Ruffalo and they ""investigate"" the disappearance of a patient from Shutter Island - a treatment center for the criminally insane. This is no vacation island and at the center is a civil war fort that houses the worst of the worst. The creepy place is run by Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, who could both make afternoon English Tea seem downright ominous.The cast is so strong that Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson are basically limited to one scene each and Jackie Earle Haley continues his resurgence with a wicked one on one scene with Leo. Michelle Williams makes her appearances via flashbacks, visions and sweaty, late night dreams. By the end of the film, her ugly yellow dress was itself a frightening prop.To cap off the mental and emotional turmoil, Scorsese adds an unusual score that at first seems overbearing at odd times, but later reveals itself to have been ""right"" all along. My favorite shot of the film is at the very beginning when the ferry first breaks through the fog. Funny enough, it was ME in a fog for the next 2 hours!","

"martinmcdonough","22 March 2010","I will write this as if a critic instead of dissecting it as I have no desire to re-hash this truly forgettable film.Shutter Island bills itself as a taut, psychological, edge-of-your-seat thriller brought to you by Martin Scorsese who managed to channel the essence of Alfred Hitchcock. It fails miserably on all those account. It had no suspense whatsoever, plodded along for the majority of the film, was incredibly predictable, and provided no plot twists or surprises at all.At the opening of the film, when the two US Marshalls played by DiCaprio and Ruffalo approached the hospital, the overbearing cello music was meant to build a heightened sense of suspense. It was more annoying than anything. When seeing that the island had a semi-detached lighthouse, one HAD to know that the climax of the film would take place either in it or around it. And when told that the most dangerous patients were kept in the old Civil War fort, you HAD to know that some key piece of evidence or information would be found there, and probably not easily. Predictability on all accounts did not disappoint.Another key sign that DiCaprio was not who he thought he was came early on with the alcoholic flashbacks and being given aspirin that was conveniently at the ready in a paper dispensing cup rather then being dispensed out of a standard bottle. And when he and Ruffalo were given Orderly uniforms while their wet clothes were being dry-cleaned, well, all bets were off by then.There came a point where the suspension of disbelief completely vanished and where the unbelievability of the plot / premise set in. I think that part happened when Koteas showed up for a few seconds and the audience behind me began to chuckle and remarks of ""oh, come on"" could be heard.One review of this film I have read states that Scorsese achieved a sense of suspenseful claustrophobia. The only time I felt that was when it seemed the walls of the theater were closing in on me after I lost interest in this movie. Either then or when I asked the girl at the box office for my money back.","

"md-ulus","20 February 2010","This is one of those rare films that only a genius could make. And having said that, I wasn't particularly *entertained* by it. In retrospect I realize there is a lot to it, a lot of implying, a lot of symbolism. Now, I like Scorcese, but I don't love Scorcese. The maestro can direct, no doubt, he can tell stories like none other, and he wields a camera like Davinci, but can he scare us? Not quite, though I don't think he meant to.This is a movie that just oozes quality, its like a Mercedes, you ride around in a plush and finely crafted interior, but somewhere along the way you lost the feeling of being in control, the passion of driving.To me the passion is missing in this film. I admire this film for its technical quality, but I was bored. I have two main issues with this film, first, no matter what the artistic intentions were, I disliked the music. It was either an unorthodox use of music in the narrative, or just plain over the top schlock. Second, the storytelling just fails to really engage. I never got caught up in the happenings on screen, in the emotional flow of fear or whatever this was supposed to do to us as we watch. It's broken up by strange dreams and hints and implications that ultimately add up to not really knowing anything, and maybe that was what was supposed to scare us, but I wasn't scared.When you reach the end of the film, you've been brow beaten into a paranoid state where nothing can be trusted, and then voila' you are shown that everyone was just playing along in a little game. This is both disappointing and interesting to watch, but not frightening. Its more of a relief, all the questions have been answered...So, in the end, all the questions are answered, that is good to know.","

"vostf","23 March 2010","This is the third time, and thus the last time, I decide to go watch a Scorsese/DiCaprio movie. A utter disappointment. Di Caprio teamed with Scorsese so he could have a great director to secure a couple of solid films over the years. I don't know who's at fault here, but Gangs of NY, The Aviator, and now Shutter Island are all devoid of emotion. They are symptomatic of this Hollywood cancer were everything looks utterly professional, well designed and nicely crafted, lots of work, energy and dough that can't make up for the lack of creativity. Lots of TV series are much better at that, and no wonder since the best writers are continuously fleeing towards non-cinema formats.The good points are the location, which would really deserve a better story, Dante Ferreti's settings and the cast - although I'm bored with good boy DiCaprio doing his best with the contrived emotional range stuffed for the main character in those scripts. Scorsese is just a journeyman in those flicks. The story is so heavy handed, it's a pity to see his devoted editor patch together dead-long scenes overflowing with pathos and deliver such this overlong and overblown continuity. There's nothing in Scorsese's direction that makes you feel the ever-present insanity. It's all in the annoying score and cheap horror tricks.Nuff said. Scorsese can't do great movies if they're not about Italian American marginals and mobsters. With Di Caprio he is bound to do overblown impersonal stuff. And Di Caprio should start to look for a real villain part because we've seen him to much trying to do good with his chubby face.Bottom line: if I had downloaded this movie instead of going for the big screen, I would most certainly have stopped watching and erase it 45min into the story, would have saved me lots of time and the bore of a movie becoming worse and worse as it rolls out on the sickening pretense of being clever.","

"Geeky Randy","26 February 2010","Scorsese's first feature-length film since ""The Departed"" finds itself wallowing in the shoes of a meaningless and predictable thriller. DiCaprio plays U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels, who's investigating the disappearance of a dangerous mental patient (Mortimer). Accompanied by a new partner (Ruffalo), Teddy begins to question whether they're investigating an escapee or if the patients and staff on Shutter Island are involved in a conspiracy that will hinder their investigation and even their safety. The film neither starts nor ends on a high note, there is no peak in this ""thriller"", and the clichéd choppiness of the filming in order to create a sense of delusion ceases to impress in the slightest. From the beginning, you know how this one will end. The splendid acting by all actors, including even those who are portraying minor characters, is grade A; and the claustrophobic mood of being stuck on the beautiful, but creepy, Shutter Island is where Scorsese's talent can be seen. There is also some noteworthy scares.**½ (out of four)","

"colinrgeorge","6 April 2010","""Shutter Island"" is a schlocky, second-rate screenplay--which has the incredible good fortune of being directed by Martin Scorsese.A psychological thriller wasn't really what anyone expected from the acclaimed filmmaker, and although he sometimes feels lost in the unfamiliar genre, Scorsese lends a natural authenticity to the predictable plot and an earnestness to the would-be flat characters that salvages what might have been another ""Wolfman"" for something half-way memorable. And, hey, he won his Oscar. What better time to branch out?The problem with Scorsese's experiment is ultimately that it feels safe, which is half a function of an unremarkable script, and half his unfamiliarity in directing horror. He approaches the genre in the way a famous baker might prepare a steak—He goes back to the recipe. Sure, he sears some effectives sequences, with palpable suspense and unsettling visuals, but it's missing those hand-written notes in the margins that bring you back for seconds.His take on the story, while infinitely superior to, say, Joe Johnston's, still isn't quite ideal, and he seems to cling to the familiar whenever possible. He has a tendency to play up the noir element, with a fetishistic infatuation for the fifties period trench coats and fedoras that Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffolo sport, and for conversations punctuated by cigarettes, with a performance vocabulary that screams of the gangster flicks he's known for. That ""Shutter Island"" so clearly bears Scorsese's fingerprints is sort of the issue: a film about an insane asylum should be anything but predictable.But the director's successes should not be undermined either, and when ""Shutter Island"" works, it really works. For instance, DiCaprio as Marshall Teddy Daniels suffers from a particularly disturbing recurring flashback (compelling perhaps because it wasn't spoiled in the trailer) that features the young man as an Allied soldier liberating a Nazi concentration camp. The grotesque imagery of the war blends beautifully with the heady horror, and the cinematography is so sharp that one might wonder why Scorsese has never taken on a war film.Scorsese also achieves some masterfully atmospheric scenes on the island itself. He has a way of making the omnipresent hurricane a character, and the way the rain beats against the windows and leaks in during the night is subtly threatening, ratcheting up the intensity that he skillfully pays off in exteriors. These great moments are hardly lonely, but even the director's eerie visuals and tight pacing falter by the final third of ""Shutter Island's"" overlong 138-minute running time.The film becomes so suddenly talky and expository at its end that the whole thing almost capsizes under the weight. There is a twist, and you will likely understand it long before Scorsese is finished spoon-feeding you the solutions to each presumed non sequitur and tying up absolutely every loose end.But even though Scorsese is feeling his way through the dark in directing a modern psychological horror film, watching him work is still enjoyable, and I stress that the vast majority of the problems with ""Shutter Island"" on the screen are problems with ""Shutter Island"" on the page. Scorsese elevates the mediocre script into an above-average thriller that, if nothing else, is better than what's playing down the hall. Whether you enter as a fan of the genre or the director, ""Shutter Island"" is a palatable film. Just don't expect to be hungry for seconds.","

"Putzberger","5 July 2011","Because honestly, it looks like you grabbed Leo DiCaprio, a couple of wind machines, a rough draft of the screenplay for ""Inception"" and made ""Shutter Island"" over a long weekend. Granted, your genius is evident throughout the movie . . . ""Shutter Island"" is muddled, confusing and ultimately pointless, but it's littered with raw, brutal, beautiful images that are much more disturbing than the nonsense storyline. What a masterpiece you could have made if you'd taken a few months to meditate on those visions of Dachau and drowning children. They could have been the heart of this movie instead of red herrings that ultimately have nothing to do with Leo's quest for . . . well, we're never really sure, since he doesn't seem to know either. Okay, maybe I shouldn't blame you for the inconsistencies of the plot, I've never read Lehane's novel. But I will remind you that some novels shouldn't be filmed, and maybe ""Shutter Island"" is one of them. I don't mind ambiguity. However, my idea of ""ambiguity"" is not knowing why Leo came to the island. Your idea of ""ambiguity"" means getting Leo to the island and then inventing five different competing reasons for him to be there . . . is he trying to find the man who murdered his wife? Is he trying to expose atrocities committed by the US government? Is he trying (and failing) to prove that he can keep an accent for an entire movie? He has to fill in the blank along with the audience, and I'm sorry, that's not as interesting as trying to solve a riddle with a single answer.","

"TomCruisin4Pssy","29 September 2023","A movie renowned for its twist, but I'd already guessed it during the first scene- this isn't at all a problem if a movie has depth beyond (or because of) its twist, and I certainly expect such depth from a Scorsese movie. And I like movies that deal with themes of guilt, trauma and repression, all of which work well with this movie's twist. Many of the complaints against it- choppy editing, continuity errors, obvious green screens- I actually liked, as I felt they added to the movie's dreamlike ambitions.Unfortunately, figuring the twist so early made me overly aware of the ""clever"" hints throughout that can feel more like awkward exposition than a natural part of the unfolding story, and I find the premise a bit absurd for a movie with a presentation so gritty and (ironically) literal- I love Scorsese more than just about any other filmmaker, but Lynch he is not. (If anything, indulging the protagonist's delusions would make them worse)Scorsese has gone from raw and resonant psychological films to operatic and formulaic tragedies; I've no inherent objection to the latter, as it's an approach that can work wonders on material it suits like The Wolf of Wall Street, but with the more intimate potential here, I feel modern Scorsese lets it down a bit; it winds up a bit sterile.","

"karlericsson","23 February 2010","In a book or a film, which is not there in order to instruct, but instead there to enlighten and construct - in such books and films, authority must never be right! In the propaganda-film, authority is always right and something to be trusted, not questioned. Furthermore, a film or book that cannot be generalized as an example for something can be described as a case-study, which, together with many other case-studies, can give rise to an interesting new theory with a possible general usefulness. A single case-study is however only interesting if it overthrows an existing theory and this film does not. On the contrary. This film (case-study) does instead glamorize existing authority.In the other films by the same author, Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River, we find the same abominable tendencies as in this film. Generalized as propaganda, Gone Baby Gone, leads us to believe that missing children are taken care of by better parents and Mystic River insidiously tries to tell us that we shouldn't feel to bad about doing wrong against the forsaken, since their lives are f-d up anyway (hinting closing-scenes in Mystic River).Of course, it is not difficult to be published as an author with this kind of content in your writing. Machiavelli managed to let the whole thing go ""over the top"" in his ""The Prince"", so that we today can read his book as a revelation of what power is all about, while he, in his day and with some courage, managed to sell as praise what in fact was its very opposite. This author's work does not go ""over the top"" however and what can be learned from it is only abominable, if you allow such ""learning"" to take place.The word is again ""fascism"", which is the idea that an elite of humans should be allowed to govern the vast majority as they, the elite, see fit and if you have a lot of money and/or power, you are a member of the club and you then publish whatever enhances your chances to stay in power, like works that defend authority.","

"Troy_Campbell","19 February 2010","In the space of a week we have been given two very distinct examples of how to (and how not to) generate genuine scares. Joe Johnston's The Wolfman exhibited cheap, shallow attempts of frightening the audience, mostly consisting of lazy ""don't look around the corner"" moments that relied on loud noises and sudden movements to make you jump. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Martin Scorsese - as you would expect from such a virtuoso director - demonstrates an innate knack for producing goose bumps, combining atmospheric sound design and terrifyingly vivid images – most notably during Teddy's dream sequences – that get under your skin to brilliant effect. Shutter Island is not a horror flick mind you. It is more akin to Hitchcock's The Birds; eerie, chilling and deeply disturbing. You'll probably not jump out of your seat once but, like Scorsese understands and Johnston needs to learn, it is what stays in your head after the credits roll that is of greater significance.Based on Dennis Lehane's novel, Shutter Island's narrative doesn't hold its punches back. Dealing with murder, corruption, alcohol abuse, mental sickness, genocide and torture; no dramatic stone is left unturned. Occasionally it feels a little heavy-handed, but what else can you expect from the guy who penned the source material for Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone? Screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis commendably keeps Lehane's story moving, never allowing it to be bogged down with one particular issue ensuring the thriller aspect of the film – arguably what the majority of audience members will be seeing the movie for - gets plenty of room to develop. With a handful of twists here and there and information drip-fed methodically, you'll never be wholly confident in what you think is happening or, more importantly, what is going to happen.Regular Scorsese collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio (he's starred in the director's last four films) is in top form yet again, adding clout to the ever-increasing opinion of this reviewer that he may well be one of the best actors of our generation. Willing to give himself over to the material completely, the onetime Romeo embodies his character with such verve and preciseness that he's never less the entirely convincing. Meanwhile Michelle Williams is quietly carving out a niche for herself as the tormented soul, her eyes able to convey so much emotion that words almost seem unnecessary; old-timers Kingsley and von Sydow provide their psychiatrists with the perfect amount of ambiguity; Haley is gruesome and sympathetic in a cameo role whilst Ruffalo plays the unfussy part of Teddy's partner with more subtle cleverness than initially noticed.Due to the class of Scorsese throughout his illustrious career this may not even make his top five, however 99% of directors around the world would gladly call this their masterpiece.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)","

"brahmjeetsinghnagpal","17 October 2019","'Shutter Island' is perhaps one of the best, if not the best, movies ever directed by Martin Scorsese. One cannot comprehend the experience in one-go. You will have to watch it twice or thrice to understand it enough, which is why Scorsese himself said back in 2010 that the movie would earn double profits because of people going to watch the movie twice.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow. They have, without doubt, given an excellent performance. And since it is directed by Martin Scorsese, you will of course be appealed by the cinematography and direction. But what's the most striking feature of this movie, the thing that makes this movie a real success is it's plot. The movie is an adaptation of the 2003 novel 'Shutter Island' by Dennis Lehane. The first half of the movie is calm and steady, but it is only a setting up for the terrific, unexpected ending which is absolutely shocking and jaw-dropping. There are several clues and intentional continuing errors that foreshadow the twist ending. The film is also filled with anagrams reminding me of which, did you know that the title 'Shutter Island' is actually an anagram for 'Truth and Lies'.The background score is also amazing, especially the one by Gustav Mahler. The background score maintains the rythm of the movie.There is only one inclusion by Martin Scorsese in the film which was not originally in the novel, the dialogue ""Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?"", which happens to be one of the most famous quotes in cinema.Overall, 'Shutter Island' is completely watchable and enjoyable. There is a lot to learn in this film while it intensifies you. Personally for me, it is the best psychological thriller.","

"lavatch","24 August 2018","While there were some merits to ""Shutter Island,"" including the fascinating island setting, the film was labored in the first half, then turned on an intriguing plot twist. Still, there is the clear impression from this reviewer that an actor other than Leonardo DiCaprio would have discovered greater depth in interpreting the main role of Teddy Daniels.The time is 1954. The setting is Boston Harbor. The more precise locale is an institution for the criminally insane in an Alcatraz of the East Coast. An innate is on the loose on the island, necessitating the arrival of the marshal, Teddy Daniels, and his sidekick, Chuck Aule. Unfortunately, the film really drags for the first hour as Daniels and Aule explore the island and are sized up the medical staff, including the two principal doctors, Cawley and Naehring. Ben Kingsley and MaxVon Sydow are in top form with an undercurrent of menace in their treatment of the visiting cops.During his whirlwind experience on the island, Teddy appears to be prone to visions or flashbacks, based upon his World War II experience of having discovered the horrors of Dachau as an American GI who first entered the camp. He was also traumatized by the death of his wife in a fire. But the dialogue seemed strained and artificial when a girl appears to Teddy and says, ""Why didn't you save me?"" with Teddy's response a succinct, ""I got here too late."" Is Teddy recalling his experience at Dachau, or is it a more personal vision of a family member?In the essential structure of the film, the success depends in large part on the actor playing Teddy Daniels. DiCaprio often overacted the part. The role demanded many facets of the character's personality and nuanced responses to intense situations. Leo simply could not carry the film the way that was needed in the psychological dimensions of a complex character.","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","1 October 2017","'Shutter Island (2010)' is a film entirely about perspective, and the first time I watched the picture I was so immersed into the perspective of the protagonist - whose point of view is intrinsically inseparable from the narrative and integral to the success of its various reveals - that I was totally swept up and taken along for the ride, made to dance like a marionette to the thriller's tightly-timed and twisty tune. I was completely in sync with DiCaprio's increasingly disheveled detective and experienced all the same emotional beats that he did, ranging from fear and confusion to sadness and even denial. As such, I was captivated and totally on board no matter how outlandish or somewhat confusing certain aspects may have seemed. I've now seen it twice, however, and the second viewing was a very different experience as, while our perspective isn't entirely out of sync with that of the protagonist, the knowledge of what's to come provides a slightly different point of view which transforms even something as simple as a sideways glance into something altogether more monumental. While the second viewing inevitably isn't as impactful as the first (in fact, it exposes a number of issues such as some second act pacing problems), it holds up remarkably well under the scrutiny of examination afforded by the separation of audience and character that occurs once you know the flick's final hand. It's still surprisingly emotionally resonant, too. 8/10.","

"Lejink","25 July 2010","Not quite sure what genre this piece of psychodrama schlock from Martin Scorces belongs too, but it's an interesting piece, straining perhaps after the heights of say Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" or Clouzot's ""Les Diabolique"", but falling a little bit marooned on its own shore by the time we reach the conclusion.For one thing it's too long and frequently disappears up its own backside in its clever-clever exposition, plus, I guessed the ""twist"" very early on in the piece. Also Leo DiCaprio is no Gregory Peck and for me never really engaged my sympathy or even general interest as Scorcese explores the canyons of his mind.The symbolism throughout is a little heavy - handed too, the bleak, isolated Shutter Island itself akin to DiCaprio's tortured mind-scape and the lighthouse as his shining way-out, although I suspect Mr Scorcese doesn't really want us to get too metaphysical here. If anything it comes off best as a homage to that strain of movie psycho-horror usually peopled with Vincent Price or possibly the comic pulp fiction of the same era.I enjoyed it and applaud the director's left-field excursion away from the mainstream - interestingly the last time he ventured near this territory was in the unashamedly populous ""Cape Fear"". I got into it more once I realised Scorcese was presenting entertainment over art, but felt it could have been drawn tighter together into a more coherent and exciting whole.","

Two cops go to an island to investigate a break-out.As the story continues with riddles of which you know you'll get the clue somewhere at the end of the movie, you already know Kingsley is behind the whole thing. There is something about Kingsley you know as a viewer you can't trust.The SS past of DiCaprio is almost well done. I like the fact Scorcese made this aspect a part of the movie, even with Kingsley in it who made his movie about Anne Frank's history. But when there is a line up and people are getting shot, they are shot all together at the same time but they drop on the floor at the time the camera is shooting them.The movie is exciting until the end. The end, where the plot drastically and originally changes, is wonderful. But then I got the feeling this movie had some flavor of the movie ""a beautiful mind"".

"kosta-pap","4 April 2010","I was very surprised to find this film was either loved or hated by most reviewers. Of course, it tends to be an inherent quality of publicly posted comments that people with strong opinions will be the ones who will bother to post, but still... I thought the film was a decent and well-made one. Predictable - yes. Over the top acting - come on, it's Marty! Too long - again, Marty. However, I must insist that the predictability of the ending was rather a strength of the film: If one were to follow the ""conspiracy/detective"" plot through 2 hours, it's logical that the ending will disappoint - but that's your problem, dear viewer! Not only is the insanity plot much more interesting, the film becomes much more interesting once you watch it from this premise. For example, the warden who drives Teddy back from the cliffs, who isn't buying into the doctors' tactics and gives him the ""you're dangerous and violent"" comments: great scene, but merely weird if you haven't suspected the context. Flaws: The score was horrible. Horrible. Destroyed many scenes, and I'm so glad Marty toned it down toward the end. The dead children scenes were redundant and extremely overused; then again, Marty always does that with his favorite ""symbols"": rubbing it in, again and again. Some of the dialogue could have been much better written, but it's a mainstream movie after all. One last note on the history of psychiatry: the struggle between psychosurgery and modern psychiatry devoted to the phenomenology of the patient's narrative - that is a true fact, and it did begin in the fifties. Furthermore, going along with a patient's delusion at crtain points of the therapeutic process: I'm appalled that many reviewers found this so absurd. I'm a psychiatrist and it's my line of work. Granted, the film is an exaggerated version of that, but it's fiction after all.","

"luke-a-mcgowan","28 November 2015","If David Fincher directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it would probably come out something like Shutter Island. Dark, deep, twisted, menacing and extremely cold - Shutter Island is by far the least Scorsese movie I've ever seen. It misses the moments of levity that made Taxi Driver, Casino and Goodfellas so captivating in their dark themes, but the dark stuff is done so well that its hard to complain about anything in that sense. It doesn't feel at all like a Scorsese picture, but it certainly feels like a well-directed one. The film is probably Scorsese's most visually arresting film since Taxi Driver, and the atmosphere is terrifying thanks to fantastic lighting and sound design from the crew. Some of the film's most incredible sequences are during flashbacks to Dicaprio's war memories, including a long take of his man massacring Nazi guards. There's some horrifying scenes in which slow falls very slowly through a scene in which a big eyed Emily Mortimer stares at the screen.I find it almost impossible to review Shutter Island without spoiling the twist(s) so I'm doing so. I knew Shutter Island's final twist, but what I really enjoyed was the massive misdirect they threw at us regarding Patricia Clarkson's Rachel and the decision we have to make between whether this is a conspiracy movie like Changeling or a psychological thriller like Memento. Shutter Island falls far closer to The Usual Suspects in execution than something like Se7en - its fun to watch clues for the big reveal even when you know what is coming. The script is tight, with some well written dialogue and incredible themes that radiate all through the film - the recurring comments that ""once you are declared insane, no one cares what you have to say"" being a prime example. The film's final line, spoken by DiCaprio to Ruffalo, will knock your socks off if you interpret it the way I did.Thelma Schoonmaker deserves most of the film's kudos for editing the film together so flawlessly to fit the suspense. She makes key decisions not to cut to Kingsley's or Ruffalo's face when Dicaprio learns something extremely important for his ""case"". Clues are dropped subtly within the film for us to pick up on, and the film rarely drags except on a few scenes that could have been cut altogether (most of John Carroll Lynch's scenes past the first half). Shutter Island gathers probably the year's finest cast, with everyone doing fine work from Ben Kingsley all the way down to Robin Bartlett in a one scene character. DiCaprio makes for a solid protagonist and does typically fine work but there are a number of moments in which it feels like he is acting, not a real person. The acting is still good, and its hugely benefited from Scorsese's cast and crew - other actors start speaking to him different, a set of circumstances force DiCaprio to wear white clothing. Above all else, his desire not to sound crazy makes him come across as crazy. Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow are both superb as men who might be conspiratorially evil in one scene and then nothing more than a kind doctor in another. Ruffalo is in his pre-The Kids Are All Right/Foxcatcher excellence phase, but does solid work throughout. The film's actresses - Patricia Clarkson, Emily Mortimer and Michelle Williams - all land slam dunks in their roles. Jackie Earle Haley aces the small part of George Noyce.Shutter Island is far from perfect, however. Jennifer Dunnington's score is at times overbearing and far from subtle. DiCaprio sometimes overdoes it. Killing his wife because she murdered their children was a big let down after being called ""an unspeakable crime"". The twist requires us to suspend a bit of disbelief - does Kingsley's experiment make him in control of the weather? Did DiCaprio seriously believe that Ruffalo killed himself after being told to stay put? All of DiCaprio's war stories end up having very little effect on the story, which padded the pretty substantial run time.Shutter Island is a fine film. Its not remarkable work that will stand out of DiCaprio's or Scorsese's resume, but its a taut, exciting thriller that is worth the time to watch.","

So, I know this review will be thumbed down by those who don't like the hard truths in life but this movie (or should I say novel by Dennis Lehane) was a nice piece of plagiarism based upon a 1920 silent film called The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.The same basic plot exists in both as well as the exact same twist ending. The lead character investigates an insane asylum and tries to put clues together to figure out the mystery surrounding the place but as we near the end, we learn that the lead character isn't there to investigate anything. He's an inmate there who has invented much of what he was investigating as part of his coping mechanism.Shutter Island would have been a good movie if it hadn't ripped off The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari so blatantly. Lehane obviously knew that the old movie was in the public domain but instead of telling the viewers that it was based on that movie, they just pass it off as his (and/or Scorseesi's idea). That, my friends, is the definition of plagiarism.I don't recommend this whatsoever for this reason. It is a shame and Lehane should be called on it but who will do it? Too much $ to be made reheating the old dishes and calling them made from scratch.Watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (it's on y o u t u b e if you want to compare the two and see that what I'm saying is 100% correct).I almost never write reviews but this time, I had to.","

You are led by director Martin Scorsese to a point where the truth takes you completely by surprise.DiCaprio and Kingsley are magnificent, and ably assisted by Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Ted Levine, and Emily Mortimer.A very suspenseful film that really challenges your mind.","

"freemantle_uk","17 March 2010","Martin Scorsese has proved time and again that he is one of the greatest film makers ever to have lived, with even his not so good film are still better then most of the films that come out. After winning his long awaited Oscar for The Departed Scorsese took his time before delivering us Shutter Island.Set in 1954, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are assigned a case to go to a mental institute on Shutter Island, off the coast of Boston. A patient, Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer) had escaped from her cell and it's clear that there was no way she could have done it alone. Teddy starts to suffer dreams and flashbacks involving when he helped liberate a concentration camp in Germany, and messages from his dead wife Dolores (Michelle Williams), offering him guidance. Whilst investigating Teddy becomes paranoid, believing there is a wider conspiracy, with patients being coached, and that the leading psychiatrists Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) were conducting experiments on the patients and that Teddy's arrival on the island was a trap. Teddy also plans to find the man who torched his apartment building where his wife died. He too was an inmate on the island.Scorsese shows once again his skill behind the camera, giving the audience a stylist, neo-noir story with a very eerie atmosphere throughout. He keeps the mystery going in this fast paced film. He tells a very compelling thriller with good horror moments in what must have been a complex novel. It is stylist, but also has a lot of substance. He give justice to Laeta Kalogridis' screenplay.Once again Scorsese turns to Leonardo DiCaprio for the lead role and DiCaprio gives one on his best performances, and a very mature performance as the guilt ridden officer. He has proved like Brad Pitt that he is more then just a pretty boy but also a very talented actor in a long career. Ben Kingsley has finally performed in film where he can give a more understated performance which he is better at. He offers a sly performance as the main antagonist of the film. Mark Ruffalo is an actor who has made his career in supporting roles, and again he does a good performance as Ted's main ally.Despite all the positives to the film, everything did not add up and by about the two thirds of the way through I guessed the big twist. However, that does not diminish the quality of the film.Shutter Island will easily make my Top 10 for 2010.","

"cdjh-81125","9 June 2016","It's always a delight to see directors have a variety of genres in their careers that's one of the reasons a love Shutter Island so much it's something completely different from Scorsese. The editing and directing in this movie is fantastic Scorsese keeps the suspense and tension he was able to achieve with The Departed and uses it even better here adding a lot of mystery leaving the viewer guessing to the very last second. This became apparent in the dream sequences as they could have come across as pretentious and melodramatic but they fit in perfectly.This is definitely a movie that's best experienced knowing as little as possible because this first and foremost is an investigation movie and you want to be able to experience that investigation with the characters. Leonardo DiCaprio returns for his fourth collaboration with Martin Scorsese and he is fantastic in this movie not only is he a character the audience can get behind he is also very complex and makes sure DiCaprio can give it everything. Mark Ruffalo was also very good in this movie he was likable and subtle. Ben Kingsley isn't in the movie much but he definitely makes the most of that screen time. This was one of the best movies of 2010 and Scorsese' most underrated movie. 96% from me would absolutely recommend this movie.","

"bmennen","21 February 2010","With this tripe, Mr. Scorcese enters into my ""hit or miss"" category. He has made some great flicks, no question, with the latest being ""The Departed."" But, Marty seems to have gone totally derivative here (Kubrick, Hitchcock and Bergman, for example) and left his creativity somewhere else.The most remarkable thing about this movie is Max van Sydow...he's 80 years old, for cripes sake and looks 65! This is silly stuff, overwrought and overlong, with dead children being the device from the black hole of creativity that is used to horrify us and cement the plot (did John Irving work on this script?).I believe the good reviews came only because Scorcese directed, and would love to have read them if the reviewers were blinded as to who was the director.Looking back, I am trying to remember one memorable scene...but I can't. One thing's for sure: I have seen enough close-ups of Decaprio to last a lifetime.","

"eddie_baggins","13 October 2019","In a career littered with cinematic masterpieces and beloved gems, Shutter Island sometimes appears to be one of the more forgotten about Martin Scorsese films, living in the shadows of granddaddy's like Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed but there's no doubt this pulpy, over the top and entirely great thriller is one of the living legends most accessible and enjoyable rides.Adapted from Dennis Lehane's book of the same name, Shutter Island is a rained drenched and atmospheric mystery with more intrigue, suspense and twists and turns than you can count, as Scorsese and his favourite leading man Leonardo DiCaprio get caught up in a missing persons case on the haunting lunatic asylum island that houses the Ashecliffe Hospital, run by its potentially devious boss Dr. Crawley, played with gleeful intensity by Sir Ben Kingsley.Filled with stunning shots by DOP Robert Richardson, a moody and nerve rattling score and fantastic supporting turns from the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley, Shutter Island is a complete of a picture as one would expect from a filmmaker of the caliber of Scorsese with the bonus being Shutter Island feels almost like three films in one.At first a more straight up mystery that morphs slowly into a horror like battle against the mind and potential nefarious forces that then becomes a haunting examination of trauma and grief, Scorsese ensures that Shutter Island is jam-packed with memorable imagery, unexpected detours and contemplative questions too become so much more than the film the synopsis or narrative might at first suggest.It's a wild ride and one that the first viewing will take many by complete surprise that's enhanced by a terrific DiCaprio performance that must surely rank amongst some of the best work the leading man has ever done.Great in other Scorsese efforts Gangs of New York, The Aviator and The Departed, for my mind DiCaprio's turn as the traumatized widower and war veteran turned U.S Marshall Teddy Daniels is one of the actors most assured performances.Tasked with inhabiting a range of different emotions and character traits, DiCaprio's transformative turn as a man battling his own demons as well as the demons of the island is awards worthy and a main reason why Shutter Island is still so regarded by casual viewers to this day.A unique film in both a genre sense and in Scorsese's career sense, Shutter Island may not get the plaudits that its other Scorsese relatives get but there's no reason to suggest this isn't as good or even better than many of its other highly regarded bloodline.Final Say -A seriously enjoyable and deeply haunting experience, Shutter Island sees Scorsese and DiCaprio on the top of their game, having fun, exploring important themes and making movies like only the best of them can dare dream to do.5 magic glasses of water out of 5","

"zetes","21 February 2010","For those who complain that Scorsese, in the 2000s, spent a decade trying to win a Best Picture Oscar, Shutter Island might be for them. It's essentially a B movie, an insane asylum-based thriller adapted from a novel by Dennis Lehane. You'll probably guess the film's final twist within a matter of minutes, but it doesn't matter too much. It's a heck of a ride. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a Federal Marshall from Boston visiting an island asylum for the criminally insane after one of their patients mysteriously vanishes. He has an idea that there might be something more sinister going on on the island. Mark Ruffalo plays DiCaprio's partner, Ben Kingsley the head psychiatrist of the institution and Michelle Williams is DiCaprio's deceased wife (in frequent flashbacks, dreams and fantasy sequences). They round out the main cast. The supporting cast includes Max von Sydow, John Carroll Lynch, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine and Jackie Earle Haley. Everyone in the film turns in an excellent, heated performance (Ruffalo is a tad more laid back than the rest). Some of the movie plays out like a first-rate horror story, especially DiCaprio's entrance into the dreaded Cell Block C, which contains the most violent criminals in the institution. As I stated above, it's pretty easy to guess at what this is all leading to, and, when it gets there, Scorsese spends far too long explicating everything. But the very last moment of the film is quite good. All in all, it's a worthy film in the Scorsese canon.","

"dansview","6 September 2015","OK, the atmosphere here was good. I like the idea of a spooky island with a mental institution on it. I also liked the 1950's motif. The pairing of Dicaprio and Rufalo was also fresh.But frankly, I've had one too many intense Leo/Scorcese movies with Leo faking some hard-boiled east coast accent and getting into a lot of arguments. Give it a rest. Everyone played themselves. Ben Kingsley, Mark Rufalo. Which is fine sometimes, but not much of a challenge.This thing went on forever. There are multiple scenes of bloody dead children and grotesquely mutilated adults. It flirts with some left wing propaganda about anti-Communist witch hunts or brainwashing, and dabbles in ""America is just as sinister as other countries"" narrative.Why not? The book writer and the movie people involved are probably Leftists. I'll give it some credit for a few good lines here and there, good acting by some of the bit players, and great atmosphere.But I don't recommend watching this thing in one sitting. You'll be looking at your watch. I like the first half set-up, but like most films, it fell apart in the second half. Scorcese is so overrated.","

"budmassey","20 February 2010","I'm not particularly fond of Leo DiCaprio as an actor, although he is steadily developing into what may one day become greatness. But director Martin Scorsese has been great for so long he is worth seeing just on principle. And of course the previews were enticing. The movie itself was, however, entirely inert.Once the anemic premise of Shutter Island unravels, which beings almost immediately and progresses with alarming rapidity, all you have left is a tedious and numbingly long dénouement that has been done before, only better. This movie has been likened to the work of M. Night Shayamalan, and the comparison is every bit the insult it was intended to be, as Shayamalan, unlike Scorsese, is known for crafting movies so pretentious, so insubstantial, and so dependent on their own hype. With Shayamalan it would have been expected. For Scorsese, I have to admit I was a bit shocked.There were protracted financial and artistic complications that delayed the release of Shutter Island. The real tragedy, however, is that they couldn't prevent it altogether. The lurid score is almost mockingly overwrought. The endless and intentionally distracting flashbacks are tawdry and ineffective. Shutter Island is beautifully filmed, and its stars render creditable performances, but it is all for naught, as the film drowns on the ferry before its stars ever reach the island.I am convinced that if Scorsese had been truer to Dennis Lehane's novel, rather than supplanting it almost entirely with Laeta Kalogridis' completely incongruous screenplay, there might have been something worthwhile. Shutter Island is a psychological drama grotesquely masquerading as a big budget thriller. If you want to see how it should be done, try Identity instead.","

It so overwrought, so desperate to make the scenes succeed, so completely contrived and overdone that it almost defies description. And no, I'm not talking about the jump-cuts or continuity breaks. I'm not talking about ANY of that. That I can deal with.

Just about EVERY SINGLE CUT is wrong... arbitrary, poorly timed, ill-advised, non-sensical.I just watched a 40 year-old episode of ""Night Gallery.""

"daniel-mannouch","14 February 2020","From the writer of Terminator Genisys and Atila: Battle Angel and directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is one of IMDB's top rated movies and i was indeed puzzled. Whilst it is a good film, it's not a standout one at all, not even within the sub genre of psychological thriller.Let's get the third act twist out of the way because that was the crucial lynch pin which snapped. I found it to be far fetched and though it was telegraphed well enough, the twist was near absurd. Dicaprio's character being a mental patient and the whole plot being part of an elaborate psychoanalytic experiment just simply was not sold to me. The amount of risky situations the patient went through and put others through were too many i found for Ben Kingsley's character to allow. He might be an eccentric psychiatrist, but he himself is not psychotic and anything short of would mean he would have called this whole thing off a while back.So what though? Did I like the film up to that point? Well, the references to MK Ultra and Mccarthyism i thought were really cute and added some much needed spice to a story that i thought was tethering on becoming cliche at times. Decaprio is not on top form, but I still found his performance to be bold. Not intentionally phoned in, just unfocused. Performances are decent, but none are really that good either. The only emotionally affecting scenes I found were the concentration camp flashbacks which i found to be the most effective of the entire film, whether they were illusions or not. The bodies frozen in ice, that arresting tracking shot, the best of the entire picture, showing the camp guards lined up and gunned down by incensed GIs. However, this is probably due to the historical context. When Daniels' kids are drowned and he kills his wife. I don't know, it just didn't have the weight it should have.Overall, Shutter Island is a good effort, but it's not one that matches up to the reputations that Scorsese and Dicaprio had previously set for themselves in their respective careers. This is one of the weakest of their collaborations I find. Stereotypes of the mentally ill, dated cinematic devices and a forced period setting makes for an experience that is underwhelming considering the talent involved.","

"Leofwine_draca","4 August 2011","After two decades of making the gangster films that his name's synonymous with, Martin Scorsese goes for something else entirely: a period-set mystery/horror/thriller that takes place in a remote, island-bound lunatic asylum during the 1950s. Scorsese openly admitted that his film's highly influenced by the Val Lewton-produced horror films of the 1940s, where lighting, camera setup and atmosphere play key roles and the emphasis is on toying with the viewer's imagination, conjuring demons in the shadows instead of trolleying in the latest variant on Frankenstein's monster.And for the most part, SHUTTER ISLAND is a decent piece of filmmaking. The movie's distinctive look is a highlight, with the old horror movie clichés (dark and stormy nights, forbidding buildings) brought vividly back to life. Scorsese even employs some dodgy back projection during the car journeys in homage to the films of yesteryear. Leonardo DiCaprio is another strength, bringing to life the character of his tortured investigator Teddy Daniels and experiencing some highly disturbing nightmares along the way.The supporting cast is packed with familiar archetypes played by familiar actors: the reliable partner (Mark Ruffalo), the urbane but slightly sinister asylum head (Ben Kingsley), along with many others including a trio of villainish types (Ted Levine, Jackie Earle Haley and Elias Koteas). As the film went on, things began to jump out at me: clues, sometimes over-obvious I thought, pointing towards a twist ending. The suspense builds and the story deepens and I become more and more convinced of the way the film was heading. In the end, I turned out to be right; I'd sussed it early on.As the credits rolled, I realised that I hadn't been entirely impressed with the production overall: it's well-made, certainly, but it covers exactly the same kind of ground that I've watched in countless B-movies from the 1930s onwards. I couldn't help but sense a slight pretentiousness to the script, a 'look aren't we clever' feel to the plotting. When compared to a similar psychological movie like THE MACHINIST, SHUTTER ISLAND comes up short. It's fun to watch once, but slightly vacuous, and once you find out the nature of the joke you're not going to want to go over it all again.","

"buckikris","9 February 2012","I went to see this at the theater on opening day, not only did I see it once but twice, it's that good. Imagine an ex US Marshal who was put in an Institution for the mentally ill/criminally insane. It happened to Teddy Daniels, an Ex US Marshal in the 1950's. The story starts out as an interesting on to Marshal's show up on Shutter Island for an investigation. Once there clues start to pop up about a missing patient Andrew Laddius. Daniels and his partner start to investigate this so called missing patient or # 67. The viewer starts to put the puzzle together, with the help of other patients at Sutter Island we see that this is not a real investigation, it is a last ditch effort to cure Teddy Daniels. He was committed two years ago when he found out his wife killed their 3 children. I would say maybe he had some sort of break down or something that part wasn't clear to me.Teddy's doctor is doing a new treatment in order to cure Teddy Daniels of his violent behavior. It is like a role playing game they are preforming at Shutter Island. Teddy/Andrew Laddius, must convince the doctor he is cured of his delusions of being a current U.S. Marshal or else this experimental treatment is all for nothing and the next step for Teddy is a Lobotomy . This treatment has most everyone involved, that works there; as well as some of the patients, and his partner is really his psychiatrist. In the end Teddy/Andrew finds out the truth, what his doctor is doing, what happened to put him as a patient at Sutter Island, but in the end when you think he would snap out of it he doesn't. I thought with an experimental treatment, maybe it would work. Then the ending comes and he begins to talk to his psychiatrists/doctor, like he's still with the Marshal Service. Then U see the psychiatrist shake his head; and they come to take Teddy away.I loved the movie; but the ending I thought could have been better. I thought sure he would snap out of it and realize that it was a therapeutic way to treat him; but it failed. I guess if anyone when though the psychological trauma he did, it would be a miracle if you could heal from that. THX, Kris L. CocKayne","

"Willie-12","22 February 2010","When it comes to directors who are of the caliber of Martin Scorsese, even when they're not producing their best stuff, it is still so much better than most everything else out there. That is the case with Scorsese's Shutter Island. This was not a perfect movie. Not by any means or stretch of the imagination. It was a bit long, and some of the material felt a little recycled. In fact, there's a sequence near the beginning of the film where it seems that Scorsese was borrowing a little too heavily from movies like The Shining or Psycho. However, this was still a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat, and thoroughly entertained. And I have to say, Leonardo DiCaprio turned in one of his best performances to date. His reaction near the end of the movie when his character faces a reality that is absolutely horrifying, was both heartbreaking and genuinely moving. I have to admit, even I got a little choked up during that scene, and that is something that almost never happens. It's interesting. When Paramount pushed back Island's release date to February 2010, I got a little nervous. After all, this time of year is a notorious dumping ground for production companies' crap. However, the fact that it was Scorsese kept me interested. I don't know why Paramount pushed the release date back. And I really don't care. All I know, is I'm glad they did. It was nice to go to the movies in February and not feel like I was throwing my money down the drain.","

"ianlouisiana","5 June 2015","Not a ""Horror Flick"" as far as I'm concerned,but a Hitchcockian exercise in delving beneath the surface of a routine Cop story. Much the same as ""Psycho"" in many respects then. Clearly Mr Scorsese has studied The Master's oeuvre and come up with a smart tribute hiding behind the schlock - horror label and the trappings of slasher - flickdom. It is 1954.Traumatised cop Mr L.de Caprio is called to what used to be known in less sensitive times as an Insane Asylum when a patient goes missing. He has his own agenda as he believes the arsonist who killed his family may be detained there. With his partner he starts making investigations that lead him to believe some kind of ""Reds under the beds"" conspiracy has taken place. The Superintendent,Mr.B.Kingsley,is less than helpful,adding credence to the cop's suspicions. A convoluted plot ensues whereby - aided by liberal use of flashback - Mr de Caprio is drawn more and more deeply into the mystery of the missing patient and its wider significance for him. Twist follows twist until the ultimate turn at the end which is open to various interpretations. After about 15 minutes a vague memory was nagging at me and eventually I recalled that I had read ""Shutter Island"" in novel form two or three years ago and it says much for Mr Scorcese's skill that I still found the ending brilliantly ambivalent. Mr de Caprio plays the deeply troubled detective quite brilliantly. He is a man who has seen things no person should have to see,both in wartime and peacetime.Just how much more can he take?","

The first clue was that inane pounding, silent-film-organ-like music that introduced every scene you in which you were supposed to scream--and not laugh hysterically. If they had cut out all that flashback nonsense, which of course I am sure Scorcese thought was so wonderfully 'artistic', they could have got the film down to about 90 minutes and could have had, well, certainly not a GOOD movie but one that was definitely not as awful as what was produced. Reminded me a lot of Gangs of New York, which also started out very strong but then went on for 100 hours. At least that was an interesting subject and prompted me to buy the book it was based on and read it. I certainly don't feel that way about Shutter Island.

I was so bored, dozed off twice, that I did not really care where the plot tried to take me. The saving grace was the strength of the cast but the cast could not overcome a very poor screenplay.

"ackstasis","23 March 2010","Most psychological thrillers of late, stylistically, have been somewhat cold and clinical – I'm thinking along the lines of Nolan's 'Memento (2000)' and Anderson's 'The Machinist (2004).' The last thriller I can recall with a dazzling colour palette was David Fincher's 'Se7en (1995).' Yet, compared to this film, 'Shutter Island (2010)' has an incredible gracefulness about it. Martin Scorsese has spoken many times of his love for Powell and Pressburger (particularly 'The Red Shoes (1948)'), and this film seems like a very deliberate, and worthy, attempt to mimic the lush visual style of Jack Cardiff's unforgettable Technicolor cinematography. There's a potential problem in painting a thriller film with such warm, inviting colours; the viewer is embraced, rather than repelled, by what he sees. This, however, is exactly what 'Shutter Island' aims for. The audience is thrust into the mind of Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), and his perception of the world becomes our reality.Teddy Daniels is a Federal Marshall sent to an isolated Alcatraz-like penitentiary to investigate the disappearance of a female prisoner/mental patient. While battling personal demons of his own, Teddy must get to the bottom of an impossible mystery, all the while faced with hostility from the island authorities. A friend of mine noted that Scorsese was probably inspired by 'The Shining (1980),' and one might cite the use of György Ligeti (one of Kubrick's composers of choice) as evidence for this. However, 'The Shining' was, stylistically, a cold and sterile film, John Alcott's cinematography eerily detached from the horrors perpetrated in the Overlook Hotel. No, Scorsese's primary inspiration was The Archers, and his use of lush, brooding colours and lighting is unforgettably atmospheric {perhaps the closest same-genre reference-point would be Roger Corman's Technicolor Poe adaptations, such as 'The Masque of the Red Death (1964)'}.Unfortunately, thanks to the inherent dangers of trawling the internet, I entered the film already aware of its ending. In any case, Scorsese seems uninterested in orchestrating the typical ""gotcha!"" narrative twist that is common to the genre. Even from the outset, the disturbance of the leading character is evident, the viewer frequently a party to his painful delusions. For most of the film's running time, we are quite happy to go along with Teddy, willing to believe his conspiracy theories. We expect to be deceived by the supporting characters, and resolve to see through their deceptions. Then something happens: the film tells us that we've been wrong, and we switch paths. All of a sudden, as he sat thoughtfully on the steps, I felt oddly distant from Teddy Daniels, his previously well-founded theories now dismissed as the musings of a mad-man. Are we, the audience, really that easy to sway? Have we just betrayed a perfectly sane man?","

"sschimel","7 March 2010","Filmed with one of the worst screenplays of the last few years, this has been compared to Hitchcock and to Film Noir, insulting both in the process. Tag line could have been ""I See Dead People 2"". Leo has grown on me as an actor, and I think he gives an extraordinary performance, but the script does him no favors. And frankly, I guessed at the beginning of the movie what the twist was, but would have preferred being wrong. I think it would have been a bigger twist. Max von Sydow is wasted and Ben Kingsley plays Ben Kingsley. The flashbacks/dream sequences/hallucinations are ludicrous, portentous, and pretentious. I hated this movie from beginning to end.","

"secondtake","21 June 2010","Shutter Island (2010)You know when a friend tells a story and includes lots of interesting details, and tells it really well so you listen to everything, and then they finish and you think, ""And?""There is a lot of that on Shutter Island. Martin Scorsese is a director who knows very much how to tell a story. And this movie, told so well, might become famous for having no punch line. It's not that the end is bad or illogical, or that getting there was so bad. Just the opposite. The end is heartwrenching and sensible, and the two hours getting there is fabulous stuff, great movie-making, and filled with all kinds of strange and beautiful moments.So you have to realize this is more about being there than the actual story. It's a finely tuned work of art, really, as a visual experience, and with a fabulous score. Expect another solid, impassioned performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, along with a whole host of superb secondary acts. Even just the island with its cliffs and gloom and sprawling old brick buildings is creepy and fantastic. The characters on it, from the glaring cops with shotguns to the host of crazed and criminally insane people, are colorful to say the least, but not exaggerated. Once you realize that the cunning Ben Kingsley is in charge or that Max von Sydow is possibly an ex-Nazi at the end of his life, you really pay attention. And then, as if this isn't enough, there begin flashbacks to World War II, and to a brutal murder, and other visions appear, including some really dreamy moments of magical realism. And you wonder how real it all is and whether it actually relates to the basic point of DiCaprio's being there as a federal marshal.As usual with this kind of movie, the setting is a pastiche of places far apart, though all in the North East, including famous Peddocks Island in Boston Harbor (which is a park, not a prison). The horrible treatment of the German (and other) prison guards shown in the Dachau scenes has some basis in truth, but in fact was probably more sporadic and messier, and did not apparently involve a whole lineup of American shooters. You can look up the Dachau Massacre for details, but of course, the bigger (much bigger) massacre that is Dachau itself belongs to Nazi cruelty, and is represented with reasonable (if cinematic) fairness here, toning down (if anything) the gruesomeness. There is a long history of unethical experiments on mental patients held by the U.S. Government, though nothing I could find that involved this particular surgical option (by the government). Lobotomies (including those made with an ice-pick sort of instrument from the eye socket, into the brain, scrambling it up a bit) were still an option available to doctors in the 1950s, when this movie was made.Still, I wouldn't take any of this movie as a history lesson. It simply layers up lots of real horrors with the imaginary ones of the fictional plot, which is pretty horrible, too. In all, we have a formal gem, a masterful construction that will dazzle and beguile your eyes and ears. But might leave you, as it has many viewers, wanting a little more for your own unscrambled brain, too.","

"moviewizguy","20 February 2010","SHUTTER ISLAND is the story of two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, who are summoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane.SHUTTER ISLAND is Martin Scorsese's first jab at doing a horror/thriller-type film since CAPE FEAR. However, there's no doubt that the film will disappoint many who are expecting a straight up horror film as the TV spots and trailers suggest. In fact, it's further from the truth. At its heart, SHUTTER ISLAND is all about atmosphere and the building of uneasiness, which, at times, do fail to work. It's not a perfect film, at least for me. It's far from it. I found the pacing to be slow at times and the mystery didn't quite pull me in as I expected it to be. Director Martin Scorsese also seem to have a hard time trying to build up suspense, especially towards the end.I also found it to be a frustrating movie experience, but I say that as a compliment. The film does get it at you in the head with the intentional inconsistent editing of scenes and making the viewers very confused with what the film has to offer. In the end, however, Scorsese manages to put all of the puzzle pieces together without cheating the audience. Sure, some might find the ending to be very bad and others might find it very obvious, but there just can't be a movie that everyone ends up liking.I loved how Scorsese refrained from using clichés from certain scenes that begs to have clichés be used. You know those scenes where the music builds up to a huge pop up scare? Well, there's none of that here. Scorsese lets the scenes play out for themselves, rarely using any building up of music at all. This is how he achieves the tone and atmosphere of the film. It's the working relationship between the cinematographer, production designers, director, actors, etc that molds every scene together which is one reason for this film to stand out on its own.The film brings along a lovely cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives it his all in here. He gives a terrific performance even as his mental state breaks down as the film progresses. Ben Kingsley does a great job in here as well along with a few scenes by Michelle Williams in her Boston accent and Emily Mortimer. Patricia Clarkson also shines through with her brief but important role. The film is also visually stunning. It's obvious that attention was put in every detail of a set and every other thing surrounding it.SHUTTER ISLAND is a film that is handled with precision and care, although sometimes losing it's focus on the big picture. It's not an Oscar-worthy film as some might hope it to be, but I enjoyed the psychological game Scorsese plays with in the audience's minds and the film's overall haunting story and tone. See this film if you like to enjoy a psychological thriller with a good story that supports a great cast and a fantastic director.","

"MovieZoo","19 February 2010","The trailer had me wondering if the movie would miss its mark. I was expecting the haunting atmosphere with a mystery to boot. I kinda wondered if there were going to be ghosts or evil creatures. But I left that in the back of my mind. I opted more for the mystery and atmosphere.Unfortunately, I expect DiCaprio to disappoint me because he just doesn't have that ""quality actor"" appeal for me. I am also aware I am probably not in the majority. But as it goes, I am slowly coming out of my cloud of negativity. This was one of DiCaprio's better roles. I liked him best in The Departed but Shutter Island is going to stick in my mind for a long time.Ben Kingsley was at the top of his game here as the mysterious Dr. Cawley. He was an easy man to be suspicious of thanks to his squinty eyes and devious smirks. Thanks also to the implications and direction of the movie. While DiCaprio and Kingsley easily filled the bill for leads, all the actors did a great job of keeping this viewer's attention.The atmosphere and scenery provided satisfactory background while the action and actors merged well to make this such a great, void-less movie. Yes, the sea was angry that day my friend, but actions, icons, trinkets and memories kept the restless mind rolling. Push came to shove when doubt tried to overrule belief. ""Up"" and ""down"" had no meaning or relevance when it came time to analyze. What did have meaning was the love for the mystery and love itself.Once again, Scorsese puts it altogether in such a beautiful way. You sir, are the boss! And I mean that in a good way. Thanks! 9 of 10","

"Meven_Stoffat","6 December 2010","Look guys, I do get it. The film is a study of insanity before a thriller/horror. Doesn't make it good. Furthermore, if you read the book you'd see my point.I read the book nearly a year before the film got released and I loved it. Quite possibly the most edge-of-your-seat book I read in a long time!!!! Furthermore when I saw the trailer and heard Scorsese would be doing the film adaptation I got ecstatic. Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers, and he directed my favorite film of 2006- The Departed. That movie was just spectacular, and it changed the way I saw movies forever. It blew my then-teenage mind, and I'll never forget the first time I saw it.So could tell, I was excited, and flocking to the theatre on opening day, I was ready to place this at the top of my list.The film is true to the book, yes. Is that a good thing? It depends. I was happy they stuck with the book, as basically it seemed like they used the book as the film's screenplay.However, I have the feeling that this would be a one star review if I hadn't read the book. For one, even my girlfriend, who hadn't read the book, knew the ending about 10 minutes in. The plot worked well in the book, but as a movie, just simply fails, again showing that not all books that are great make good movies. The movie is pretty alright, as it is lush and colorful in a few scenes and at times even seems like a Gothic horror film. Again, pretty pictures does not equal good movie.Another thing ruining the film is its ""punch in the face"" musical score. Come on, the score was ridiculous. Spooky tingling piano music!!! Nazi-marching-into-town-music!!! LOUD BRASS music!!! Whoever did the score needs a kick in the teeth. The murder scene near the end was hilarious due to the inappropriate spooky tingling piano music.In short, honestly this film is pointless. I love Scorsese but this film just doesn't do anything for me. Skip it.","

"stefinlithuania","20 March 2010","Oooo! it's Scorsese! and The Caprio, and Ben ""Gandhi"" Kingsley. Let's start the praise, the ""masterpiece litany""!!!! The film is presented this way (the quote is from a review at IMDb's): SHUTTER ISLAND is the story of two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, who are summoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane. Try now to believe it. As the aim of the movie is to deny what you have just read. So what's the point? I can introduce Alice in wonderland like ""it is the story of a Chinese manufacturer who is hired by a mysterious underground tea dealer. Eventually she has to confront the mischievous queen of Tibet to defend a bunch of rabbits"". Shutter Island is a bad movie. Everything is built on a ""twist"" which is clear since the very beginning. In-depth explanation involving fire and water dichotomy (some review at IMDb's) must come from patient 64. There are a couple of nice shots (nice doesn't necessarily mean ""beautiful""), but there are a lot of flaws in the ""story"", boring clichés, incongruences, unexplainable behaviour even for an asylum... and the more you try to sum up things, the worst it looks.","

"Turfseer","24 June 2010","I have to liken 'Shutter Island' to another mystery-thriller: 'The Sixth Sense'. Both have a myriad of clues planted throughout the narrative, leading to a highly entertaining twist ending. I'll confess that I was pretty much fooled up until the climax but I did have my suspicions that things couldn't be what they seemed. At first, it seems that 'Shutter Island' is going to be a tale about some evil psychiatrists (aided and abetted by a corrupt staff) who are conducting secret experiments on a hapless population of psychiatric patients. Dr. Cawley (perfectly played by Ben Kingsley) does everything he can to stymie Federal Marshall Teddy Daniel's investigation including his refusal to hand over staff personnel folders. Before you know it, there are rumors that lobotomies are being performed at the lighthouse, on a different part of the island.I became quite confused after the hurricane when Teddy and his partner Chuck (later revealed to be psychiatrist, Dr. Sheehan) are so easily able to walk into Ward C, where the most dangerous patients are housed. After all, if this was where all the really bad things were happening, wouldn't Cawley and his guards make it a point to prevent Teddy from learning Ward C's dark secrets? My best reasoning held that the marshals were able to slip into the off-limits area due to the confusion in the aftermath of the storm. But it didn't look right; the guards supposedly knew who Teddy was and they were simply letting him casually walk into the house of horrors where he does in fact learn that patients are being mistreated (i.e. lobotomized).Was this simply an example of poor screen writing or was something more sinister afoot? As it turns out, Teddy's beliefs that everyone was out to get him on Shutter Island, was simply a paranoid fantasy. In fact, Teddy's 'investigation' was simply an elaborate role-play set up by Dr. Cawley, designed to break down Teddy's defenses. The ubiquitous Rachel Solando, who supposedly murdered her three children, was one of Dr. Cawley's staff members, pretending that she was a murderer in order to help Teddy realize that it was actually he who had murdered his wife after discovering that she had murdered their three children.Because all of this calls for a great suspension of disbelief, Shutter Island ranks up there as a solid piece of film entertainment but holds it back from being considered a true 'artistic masterpiece' (as some have argued it is). There are three big problems with the film's narrative.Firstly, there's a big assumption here that such role-playing could ever lead to such a huge improvement in a paranoid schizophrenic's psyche. Cawley and Sheehan concede that the role-playing can lead to a regression (as it did with Teddy nine months earlier, as they candidly admit). They call it a new ""experimental therapy"" but role-playing has been around for centuries. It looks awful nice how they get Teddy to confront his demons, but I would think that role-playing (as it's shown here) would tend to aggravate the patient, much more than it would lead to any kind of meaningful revelations.That leads to the second problem: why would the Board of Overseers countenance such a therapy? After all, those are the guys who approve the lobotomies at the slightest hint of violence amongst the mentally ill population. Back in 1954, lobotomies were actually believed to be helpful for patients. Why would such do-gooders, such as Cawley and Sheehan, be given the chance to turn Teddy around? Not only don't I believe such people would be in charge of a Federal lock-up for the criminally insane but even if they were, they would not be allowed to conduct such a role-play experiment.In reality such an experiment would place both the staff and the prison population in jeopardy. In a ridiculous scene, after Teddy bursts into the lighthouse, Cawley asks him, 'did you hurt the guard very badly?' In real life, he would never have been allowed to put any of the guards in jeopardy. Just imagine if Teddy actually had killed the guard by slugging him over the head with the rifle? And would Dr. Cawley allow his expensive European convertible to go up in smoke just to help the most dangerous patient on Stutter Island—simply out of the goodness of his heart?. I know he's a liberal but no one's that liberal when it comes to their own property that's worth so much money.So without the role-play taking place, there's no twist ending and no accolades for Dennis Lehane, the author of the novel along with Director Martin Scorsese. Nonetheless, there's much to admire about this picture. Scorsese has a terrific way with camera angles. I love all the subtle closeups such as when the Dachau Commandant reaches for his gun, as he lays wounded in his office along with the old Victrola, with the record playing over and over. Scorsese sometimes overdoes things, especially with those scenes involving the murdered children at the end of the film (just a little too much blood for my tastes). All the performances are quite good here including Kingsley (as noted earlier) along with a very cool Max Von Sydow (who at first glance is supposed to be the bad guy but on second viewing, is quite benign).Scorsese also smartly added the ambiguous line at the end suggesting that Teddy is cured but pretends to be insane since he can no longer live with the guilt of failing to save his children at the hands of his murderous wife.This is the type of picture worth watching twice. The first time around you'll be in the dark; the second time you'll watch it for all the clues missed. But after that, there are no profound ideas here to sift through. In other words, an Ingmar Bergman film it ain't! But as a solid entertainment—it hits the mark!","

"fung0","17 June 2013","Scorsese is surely THE most over-rated American director of all time. I vowed never to see another of his bombastic travesties, but was lured into this one by the interesting premise. Alas, only to discover I was right all along. If Scorsese ever makes another good film, it will be purely by accident. He should stick to doing inane commentary on disc releases of other people's films.Shutter Island seems fine at first: a 'mystery wrapped in an enigma' sort of thing. But it gradually unravels, like all Scorsese's films, as he tries strenuously to demonstrate his genius, rather than simply telling an intelligent story. The ending is a final insult - of the ""aren't you sorry you bothered"" variety. It's a silly trick that Rod Serling might have used for a half-hour TV diversion, and then only with a much-needed element of self-deprecating irony (a seasoning unfamiliar to the self-absorbed Mr. Scorsese).Scorsese knows how to move a camera around, and get good performances out of his actors. But if you value logic and meaning over surface gloss, you need to stay away from this piece of elegant drivel.","

"Dr_Coulardeau","11 April 2010","It is in many ways a great film. It questions the ""heritage"" of the Second World War and the horror the American soldiers discovered in the camps, in this case here Dachau. It is also more than clear on the passage of some of the researchers of Nazi Germany to the US to continue their research in peace, including if necessary with human experiments when dealing with medical research. It is unluckily well-known that prisons and orphanages were places of hellish torturing and violence in the name of research or reform. That's the first level of the film. The second level is: what can society do with the few human beings who are so bad that they can't be reformed? Various solutions are available: lobotomizing them to turn them into docile pets, pharmaceuticalizing their cases so that they become chemical zombies, or manipulating their minds to make them convinced of what they have done and of the necessary punishment called treatment they are receiving. The film goes even as far as imagining the production of human killing tools that could be used in wars. Surgery, drugs or mental manipulation, that's the choices envisaged here. The three of them are all just fully wrong. But the film is a lot more disquieting than that if we deal with the simple fact that the decision of a psychiatrist to classify you as anything psychic or psychological is absolutely irreversible and everything you may say or do to prove you are not will be turned into the evidence that you are and will be used against you. In other words the lady always protests too much. That's the Kafka aspect of the tale. But the film is even better than all that because Scorsese in his personal style builds a story in which we do not know at all at the end if the two cops were really what they pretended to be at the beginning and thus were kidnapped by the doctors to make sure nothing will seep out of their concentration camp, or if it is the doctors who are right at the end and that the two cops are what these doctors pretend, one is a killer and the other his doctor and that the whole tale was a medical procedure to reach treatment. At the end there is only one choice left: to live as a monster or to die in dignity. But what is dignity in such an environment? We are happily doubting everything at the end, which may create a feeling of frustration in the audience.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID","

"tburke85","12 June 2010","Shutter Island is an excellent suspenseful thriller with some flaws which I'll get into later but the good more than outweighs that bad in this one. Director Martin Scorsese is admirable in making Shutter Island giving audiences nearly everything they could expect or want from one of these films. Leonard DiCaprio is great as always as Teddy Daniels a US Marshal on route to a remote island for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a murderess who somehow escaped from her locked hospital room. Or as Ben Kingsley's mysterious head Dr. Crawley explains; ""We don't know how she got out of her room. It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls."" Leonardo DiCaprio brings an intensity to the role (like in Blood Diamond and The Deaprted to name a couple) and at times vulnerability. He continues to show audiences and critics his talent as an actor. This film is no different. Well done. The rest of the talented cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, and Max von Sydow in a small role are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Particia Clarkson, Elias Kosteas, John Carroll Lynch, Ted Levine, and Jackie Earl Haely are also very good in their brief extended appearances since most of the story's focus is on DiCaprio which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Shutter Island turned out to be much better than expected. It has an interesting story, suspense, an eerie mood, and atmosphere with strong performances from the cast. The movie also has some nice twists and surprises. One I sort of did suspect and others I found surprising to say the least. So it's better to avoid spoilers and watch this film without knowing too much about the plot for you to truly enjoy Shutter Island. I found this film to be much better than others who disguise themselves as suspense thrillers (The Grudge, The Happening, and Shutter to name a few). I enjoyed that Scorsese didn't heavily rely on CG except for some and instead used for the most part realistic locations and atmosphere to create the suspense. The location they chose for the island was a perfect setting for this story to take place and it added a lot to the movie. The flashback sequences of Teddy's time in World War 2 were an interesting touch that give us some insight into his traumatic past which continues to plague him while on the island. The pace of the movie was a little slow in the beginning before the suspense really started to kick into high gear but overall I can't think of all that much I didn't like about this film. Sure it might have some tiny flaws including a surprise I sort of saw coming but I thought Scorsese still did a good job with the execution of the twist none the less. In some ways Shutter Island reminded me a bit of the Shining because both films used actual locations, surreal images, and atmosphere to create suspense build up instead of relying on CGI. I was impressed with this movie and I plan to watch it again sometime because second viewings I think are needed to fully understand the story so it makes sense. Not that the story itself is very complicated but I believe Shutter Island's worth watching a second time even with a 138 minute running time because the film is that good despite it's few flaws. If you're in the mood for a suspenseful thriller or you're a fan of the genre, you can't go wrong with Shutter Island. It has an intricate story, suspense, twists, surprises, and solid performances by the cast (especially DiCaprio, Ruffalo, and Kingsley) who make this thriller worth the time to watch.","

"MrGKB","27 August 2010","...that leads me to question (once again) the movie-going sensibilities of the ""common man"" as represented by the denizens of the IMDb. I am utterly perplexed that this high-grade bit of noir-ish filmmaking has so impressed the masses; its current rating is far too generous for what's been delivered. Much like ""Avatar,"" Scorsese's latest is all about style and very little about substance. The ""twist"" to the story is so transparent that it becomes obvious long before the film is over, thus rendering the final reels an exercise in tedium. Hearkening back to the days of Hitchcockian psychological thrillers, replete with obvious dreamscape tropes like vertiginous cliffs, revelatory caverns, and hallucinatory warnings, ""Shutter Island"" mines its territory with no small degree of authority, but no lesser degree of familiarity and lack of tension and surprise. The professionalism of the work is admirable, but its creativity and heart are, sad to say, pedestrian and unremarkable. I have no doubt that the novel on which it was based is a better read than ""Shutter Island"" is a viewing.Scorsese scored his best box office to date with ""Shutter Island,"" so I suppose I shouldn't complain too loudly about how he's been progressively dumbing down his product (although, then again, maybe that's exactly what I should be complaining about); it's at least small blessing that his repeated collaborations with Leonardo ""Titanic"" DiCaprio have born financial fruit. Using established collaborators/luminaries like DP Robert ""Kill Bill"" Richardson, production designer Dante ""Casino"" Ferretti, and a host of name actors (even in peripheral roles) certainly didn't hurt, but unlike the aforementioned ""Vertigo"" and others of its stature, ""Shutter Island"" is destined to recede from the fickle memory of the great unwashed masses to take its place in the immense repository of ""better than a sharp stick in the eye"" films that Hollywood churns out by the hundreds.What is it with the lapdog idolization of Scorcese by the predominantly adolescent/young adult IMDb legions? The man has helmed a solid pantheon of ""great"" movies, including ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""Goodfellas,"" and arguably ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (and perhaps even ""The King of Comedy""), but this is little reason to elevate his lesser works to equal heights. Are his fans here on this site truly that indiscriminate, or unschooled? Perhaps it has to do with the man's intimate devotion to popular music, as evinced by films like ""The Last Waltz,"" ""No Direction Home: Bob Dylan,"" ""Shine a Light,"" and the upcoming ""Sinatra;"" I don't know. All I know, I suppose, is that Scorsese is finally getting his due, and I suppose that isn't all bad. If it takes LCD work like ""Shutter Island"" to do it, I guess I'll accept it. But it won't change my perceptions of quality storytelling one iota, nor my dismay at the easy acceptance of average as excellent by the bulk of young moviegoers.","

It largely inoculated me from the dreadfulness that would follow.But the rest of the audience was, apparently, not so lucky. As I left the theater what I saw were psychologically traumatized people as a morose darkness had descended upon their Friday night.If your idea of a good evening out is to be severely psychologically disturbed, this is a movie for you.

Throughout the entire movie, I had the annoying feeling that it was always rather obvious what was going to happen. The script isn't quite as mysterious or complex as the makers assumed it was, it's not particularly difficult to figure things out. All other aspects of the movie are nothing short of brilliant though. DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are both perfect for their roles, the scenes they share are the highlights of the movie. The style of the film is also very well-crafted, the images are beautifully gripping. Still, none of that quite holds up when the key twist is rather predictable.","

I am certain you will figure it out as I did and I am slow with these things. The acting by all is very good. I just wish the story was better. It was not, but the opportunities were certainly there. For all the hype that came with this movie, there was no suspense, tension and you really don't care about the characters. You'll see. Still, it will hold your interest even though you have figured it all out. Something, eh?Oh, I did watch it on a bright, sunny afternoon. Turns out, I didn't have to. Not scary. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes. Crude Sex Language: Yes. Language: Yes.","

"JamesHitchcock","16 December 2011","U.S. Marshal Edward Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule travel to the (fictitious) Shutter Island in Boston Harbour, which houses a hospital for the criminally insane. They are investigating the disappearance of one of the patients, Rachel Solando, who has been confined in the hospital after drowning her children.As the film progresses, however, we begin to suspect that Daniels may have other motives for visiting the island, motives connected to his troubled past. In a series of flashbacks we learn that Daniels' wife Dolores died in a fire two years earlier. We also learn that Andrew Laeddis, the arsonist responsible for starting the fire which killed her, is also incarcerated on Shutter Island. Is his real motive for seeking this assignment, therefore, to seek revenge against Laeddis? Or is it, as he claims, to investigate claims that the US government is using the hospital to conduct illegal psychiatric warfare experiments? The death of his wife is not the only dark secret in Daniels' past. We also learn about his experiences in World War II, where he was one of the American troops who liberated the Dachau concentration camp. He is also tormented by guilt about his part in the ""Dachau massacre"", when American soldiers killed a number of the German guards.One reviewer wrote that ""aafter four decades, Martin Scorsese has earned the right to deliver a simple treatment of a simple theme with flair."" I agree with him about the flair, but cannot agree with him about the film's simplicity, either in its theme or in its treatment. This is a very complex film indeed, and not only in terms of its plot, which I won't set out in any greater detail, as I don't want to give away the ending. The film deals with several interrelated themes, namely the relationship between reality and illusion, that between sanity and madness, and that between crime and law enforcement. Can Daniels trust anyone, including his partner Chuck or Dr Cawley, the head of the institution? Can he even trust his own memories, or is he suffering from hallucinations? Is he really who he claims to be? Is he really who he believes himself to be? At one point, one character points out the similarity between the word ""trauma"" and ""Traum"", the German for ""dream"". Etymologically there is no connection between the words- ""trauma"" is derived from the Greek for ""wound""- yet one feels that there should be, as a mental trauma and a dream are two different types of illusion.The influences on the film are also complex, and go much deeper than the standard modern thriller. An obvious influence is the film noir of the forties and fifties, the period during which the film is set. Another influence is the work of Alfred Hitchcock, who throughout his career, and especially in films like ""Spellbound"" and ""Psycho"", was fascinated by psychology and psychiatry. A third influence is the horror film; the plot can be seen as the modern equivalent of an Edgar Allan Poe story. (As in some of Poe's works, word-games and anagrams play an important role). Visually, too, the film, with its autumnal feel, mist-shrouded woods and graveyards, owes something to the horror tradition, although a distinctive visual style is also a hallmark of many neo-noir films. Some visual elements- a cave, a lighthouse- take on a symbolic importance of their own.I never really liked Leonardo DiCaprio in his teen idol phase in the nineties, but after ""Catch Me if You Can"", ""The Aviator"" (also directed by Scorsese) and ""Revolutionary Road"", ""Shutter Island"" confirms that he has become a fine actor and one of Hollywood's leading talents, especially as the mentally tormented Daniels, unsure of his own identity, must have been a particularly demanding role to play, as demanding as Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator"" and perhaps more so than the roles he took in the other two films mentioned. He receives good support here from Michelle Williams as Dolores (seen in flashbacks) and Ben Kingsley as the smooth and outwardly humane Cawley, who may be hiding guilty secrets of his own.As I stated, I won't give away the ending of the film, but I can say that it involves a startling twist when Daniels is confronted with new information which completely overturns everything we have previously been led to believe. This revelation seems to make perfect sense of all that has gone before, and it significantly takes place in the lighthouse, a structure whose very purpose is to lighten the darkness, so it can be seen in symbolic terms as an enlightenment for both Daniels and the audience. Or can it? Even when it seems that the truth has been made clear, there are troubling hints that this might not in fact be the case. What if Daniels has in fact been the victim of a massive and cruel deception? (To judge by the message boards on here, there are people who have interpreted the film in two quite different ways). This ambiguity, which in some films would have been a weakness, is here a strength, a good example of a film which actually becomes deeper and more profound because its meaning cannot be pinned down precisely.I was surprised that the film was not nominated for any Oscars, although part of the reason may have been the fact that its opening date was shifted, for financial reasons, from late 2009 to early 2010, thus making it ineligible for the 2010 awards. Despite this neglect by the Academy, however, ""Shutter Island"" confirms my view that Martin Scorsese is one of the finest directors working today. 9/10","

"DICK STEEL","7 April 2010","It's easy to get all riled up over the latest Martin Scorsese film starring his recent favourite actor of choice, Leonardo DiCaprio. After all, the destination is something of a big wool pulled over your eye, but as the saying goes, it's never the destination but the journey itself, and Scorsese pulls off a mighty fine psychological thriller whose horrific elements aren't what we get from the trailer with its chop-socky boo-moments, but were a lot more cerebral, tying in very closely with the entire feel of the film.In some ways, Scorsese helmed this film to Hitchcockian proportions, and constructed a tight mystery thriller which to my surprise, still had a lot going despite one knowing how it would end, either being a reader of the novel by Dennis Lehane (which I am not), or through the many clues that simply pepper the film from start to finish. There were some jarring moments which I thought pared down to bad editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, or wondered if Scorsese was being very slipshod in bridging cut scenes or continuity laced with perturbing errors, but all these were played out for a reason, and by the time the final reel unspools, the dust will settle.Which I felt was perfect in getting you under the skin of DiCaprio's Teddy Daniels, a US Federal Marshal assigned to the titular Shutter Island which houses a mental institution for the criminally insane, because one of the inmates, or patients as Chief Psychiatrist Dr Cawley (Ben Kingsley) insists they are called, have simply vanished through the walls, and a search has been deemed futile. Together with new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), the federal marshals soon stumble upon an uncooperative lot in the facility, coupled with the usual crazies who play on your mind with their various testimonies.And to make it a wee bit complex, there's a brewing hurricane that prevents our cops from leaving, Teddy's visions of his dead wife coming back to haunt him, and a growing conspiracy that involves inhumane experiments that those in power allow to happen clandestinely to be performed for the advancement of neuroscience, and to create almost zombie-like perfect killers/soldiers ala The Manchurian Candidate. As mentioned, the narrative sucks you in and keeps you engaged, though some parts because they can get repetitive (remember, it's all for a reason), may hang you out to dry if you're not paying close attention.DiCaprio has grown from strength to strength as an actor, and frankly, he almost single- handedly made this film work. Without his charismatic presence and fine performance, many elements presented in Shutter Island may not be pulled off successfully, since it relied heavily on the actor playing Teddy Daniels to really show a vast range of ability, and more importantly, to make you feel for him totally in his predicament to dig deep and discover just what hanky-panky is going on in the island, while haunted by many ghosts from the past. There were some physical scenes which were obvious a stuntman had taken over, but no substitutes can be used for his dramatic moments of course.The supporting cast also put up a commanding performance, from Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo, to Max con Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer and Jackie Earle Haley. Talk about a star-studded casting against a very gritty and scary backdrop, boosted by very nifty special effects when the narrative calls for it. And for those who prefer their horror in old fashioned terms, there are, in my opinion, eerie images enough to shock and make your goosebumps stand, thanks to anticipation being build, plus the actual deliverables that gave me the creeps.So climb onboard the ferry to Shutter Island, and allow the latest Martin Scorsese-Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle to bring you on a slow brewing mystery ride that straddles the fine line between fantasy and reality, complete with plenty of discussions on the mind and sanity check. Incidentally, the next DiCaprio film out later this Summer, also deals with the cerebral, and helmed by Christopher Nolan. Now that is something I want to see, but in the meantime, an excursion to Shutter Island is recommended.","

"pyx","11 April 2010","One commentator has noted that this movie is a direct remake of The cabinet of Dr Caligari from the 1920's, but more recently the even more abysmal ""For Sale by Owner"" took the identical premise - investigator turns out to be the mental one, and butchered it. With such recent failure, one would hope that the script-writers could do something more imaginative.Setting this movie in a mental home is such a cop-out because it means that nothing you see has to be real, or make sense.The excessively overbearing soundtrack is as unsubtle as the rest of the movie, which is to say that even to numb-skull like me, the ending glared out from 15 minutes into the movie, and it was only the precise details that remained to be filled in.Everyone's acting is first rate, but that does nothing to make up for the lack of satisfaction that this weak movie provides.Surrealism doesn't automatically make a good movie, any more than a ""twist"" ending. It would have been a far greater twist if DiCaprio's character had gotten away and proved that there WAS a conspiracy...I had such high hopes for this looking at the people involved with it, but now another great director is struck off my ""always trust"" list.Has Hollywood's desire for safety tainted even this great director?","

"davidhusainow","10 February 2016","This is my first film directed by Martin Scorsese. And I am amazed at the script, the actors play, storyline. Undoubtedly, this is one of the best movies I have ever watched. Why I was interested in?Firstly, it is the atmosphere of the film. 1954. Many people watch films like this because they want to plunge into the atmosphere of antiquity. So, the spirit of antiquity is shown dynamically. Since the beginning of the film the contrast between the island and the outside world emphasize very clearly. And when the story starts to develop in a bad condition for Marshall, you begin to understand the hopelessness of the situation - and this ending seems really confusing and intriguing.Secondly, it is an actor's game. DiCaprio. And that's all. Wonderful play, emotions, story comprehension. Mark Ruffalo is able to create a perfect image of partner. I especially want to mention the scene in the room when Rachel called her husband Marshall.Thirdly, it is a plot. In my opinion, the further the film, the more puzzles which keep us in the entire movie screen. And all of the solution - at the end, though all at once. The plot is the most important. That's why you must to see the movie. You never know what it will end.Fourth, this is the place. The island with all its old buildings is perfectly suited to the scenario. Weather, fortress, mysterious hundreds of rats, ominous cliff ferry with shackles and horror picture, lighthouse are created for the brilliant creations Scorsese. I was surprised by the memories of the main hero. Camp Dachau, wind, dead bodies, burning by hate DiCaprio or the burning house with his wife. Everything is shown to stop the viewer's heart. I recommend this film.","

"jullashanghavi","20 March 2010","After coming on this usually reliable site and seeing the high rating for Shutter Island, I decided to check the movie out. I was HIGHLY disappointed so much so, that it frustrates me to even give it enough attention to write this review.THE GOOD: The cinematography made this film somewhat tolerable. The opening scene was great, but then it went downhill from there THE BAD: Whoever wrote this film should be ashamed. There was no originality to this plot whatsoever, and the overacting almost made this film unbearable. The ending was so frustrating that I wondered if I actually missed something. I kept waiting for the movie to get better, but it never did. I just kept thinking that this couldn't have been one of those ""it was all a dream"" clichés, but sadly it was. The entire film was so redundant that all I could say at the end of the film was: ""seriously?"" Do NOT waste your money it will leave you angry and frustrated.","

"hall895","13 July 2010","We have seen before that a big twist at the end can make an otherwise ordinary film into something much greater. Think The Sixth Sense. But we have also seen that relying on a final big twist to save your movie can be a dicey proposition. Because if your big twist doesn't have as powerful an impact as you would hope your movie falls flat. Think M. Night Shyamalan films other than The Sixth Sense. Sadly Shutter Island falls into that trap. The ending doesn't satisfy and certainly doesn't redeem all that came before it. Because so much of what came before is rather mundane. But you hold out hope because you know the story is building towards some kind of big revelation. It has to, this is a movie which screams ""Twist!"" from its very beginning. This was never a story which was going to play out in a straightforward, conventional manner. So for whatever disappointment you may feel as the movie progresses the hope is still there that there will be a big ending to save the day. But alas that is not to be the case. The movie fizzles out. The ending, really the whole movie, turns out to be a dud.Now of course Martin Scorsese is not a man prone to churning out duds. So how did this all go so wrong? Maybe it's a case of a story trying to be too smart for its own good. It's a puzzle in which not all of the pieces end up fitting together properly. We start with an interesting setup. Two U.S. Marshals are sent to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a patient from a hospital for the criminally insane. The fact that this hospital is located on an island essentially cut off from the world ratchets up the intrigue and suspense. But right from the start you get the sense this movie's messing with your head. Something's not right. Somebody's hiding something. Somehow everything seems just a bit off. Is it the location? The characters? Whatever it is there's a great sense of mystery, the possibility of great discovery. But the movie never pays off that initial promise. Eventually you get the sense you are destined to be let down. And in the end you are.Leonardo DiCaprio does the best he can with the lead role of Marshal Teddy Daniels. Whatever failings the film has can't be laid at DiCaprio's feet. He is utterly convincing. But the story is not. There are plenty of fine performers to support DiCaprio. Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow and Michelle Williams all play their parts well and there is room for some fine work from other actors in smaller roles. But ultimately the fine cast is let down by the story. The story is the big problem. There are other problems too. The overbearing musical score comes to mind. But it is undoubtedly the story which dooms the movie. When the final piece falls into place you look back and realize the story's not nearly as smart as it needed to be. The end result is an utterly ordinary movie. It's one of those movies which demands a second viewing to really see how all the pieces come together. But it's not an interesting enough movie to make you care enough to go back and watch it again. Once is enough. A second viewing isn't likely to enhance your appreciation any. You can look back, put it all together in your mind, and realize it just doesn't work. Scorsese has made such a brilliant career for himself with tough, gritty, urban dramas. With Shutter Island he wanders a bit outside of his comfort zone. He's done so before to sometimes good effect. But this time he couldn't make it work.","

"brentn","15 February 2021","More psychological and atmospheric but no less effective, practically brilliant. Leo and Ruffalo are great as the leads and all the other players are very effective at bringing a secretive and haunting feeling with powerful realism. The setting is made to entice pure dread and is so effective that by the end you really do feel for the characters and are totally immersed. I have never been a huge Scorsese fan, not since Goodfellas but this got my attention and will stay will me. Great film.","

"dicksosa","19 March 2010","A fresh attempt to make a story with an unexpected twist to keep the audience guessing until the end is just what this films attempts to do. Attempts but doesn't quite succeed as well as others have before. The film does leave the audience wondering what really is going on. We have two detectives that arrive at shutter island and must figure out the mysterious disappearance of a patient.The set design and production values are well accomplished. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo are accompanied by Ben Kingsley and perform outstandingly through the film. The acting isn't over done and is spot on for each character. The acting really brings to life the story. Although in parts the plot is quite disturbing and can make one look away and cringe for the most part it isn't full of holes and does all tie together.This film falls short however in the fact that it's so much of a tale about trying to figure out exactly what the real story is that you already guess what the real story is and then have to sit and wait for the picture to tell you what you already know. It's like watching the DaVinci code and knowing what the solution to the puzzle is, the intrigue loses something when you already have the answer to the riddle.All in all the film is something fresh and tries to be new, It's acting is superb and story line flows fairly well. It simply falls a little boring once you know the punchline. The ending line of the movie however does bump up the score one point just simply because you don't really know how it ends even after you know how it ends.","

"griffolyon12","19 February 2010","Director Martin Scorsese weaves a tale that I can't quite place words upon. Shutter Island is part drama, part thriller, part horror. It is a touch film noir, while also being a pinch trippy. Regardless as to what it truly is, the mystery of Shutter Island is one worth seeing, but perhaps not the director's best in his long pantheon of work.On an island off the coast of Boston, engulfed in the fog and on the rim of a hurricane, there lies a mental hospital called Aschliffe. The hospital only takes the most dangerous, most mentally unstable patients. A patient has recently escaped, and no one can explain her mysterious disappearance. Two U.S. Marshalls come to the island, our hero Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner. But is there more going on upon the mysterious Shutter Island than meets the eye? That is what Teddy is trying to find out, while also searching for his wife's killer, who is an inmate in the institution.This film is what one would call a mindbender, and for that Scorsese should be duly applauded. While I figured out the big twist at the end about halfway through the film, I was severely impressed at how well Scorsese painted a portrait of insanity in this film. To call this film crazy would actually be a compliment and not a detriment to its storytelling abilities. It is an insane film, making you feel as if you ventured inside a crazy man's head for 2 hours. Dream sequences, hallucinations of the ghosts of his past, Teddy is our guide through this look at sanity and its breaking point, and it is there that the film is the most stunning.The dream sequences highlight Teddy's past, his traumatic history. The death of his wife, his time serving in World War II where he came across a graveyard of dead bodies in a Nazi concentration camp. A man with such a tragic past, it is very easy to see how he eventually snapped. Though, it is with these dream sequences that Scorsese evokes his adoration for film noir. Teddy is the quintessential film noir protagonist. He's a troubled man, haunted by his past, and he is madly in love with the elusive woman he can't have. DiCaprio is stunning as Teddy, delivering a timeless performance that at times is reminiscent of Bogart or Cagney, but he always remains true DiCaprio and makes the emotional scenes between Teddy and his deceased wife all the more believable and heartbreaking.Martin Scorsese instituted his trademark visual flare here with the marvelous dream sequences and well done flashbacks, but as a whole the film lacked that special something to make this one of Scorsese's best. The film starts off riveting, dripping with suspense, and oozing with mystery. The latter half of the film is not as strong as the first, and it is debatable as to whether or not the ending was the right one for the film, because it kind of feels as if the story kind of just comes untied and feels incomplete rather than satisfying. Regardless, the film is a visual feast and is a cinephile's dream, and don't get me wrong, the film is entertaining and mindbending, but it does not manage to live up to the suspense, nor the mystery set up at the beginning of the film.I give Shutter Island an 8 out of 10!","

"wrbones","28 February 2010","I'll start by saying that I did enjoy this film overall but there are a lot of really annoying aspects to it. First off is DiCaprio's stubble, which in 1954 would have made him a vagrant, not a US Marshall. Then there was the ridiculous music that accompanied an inconsequential scene of the marshals entering the asylum gates for the first time. It built up and built up, then nothing happened. That kind of thing is really annoying. The score overall veered from terrific to grating and inappropriate in places. I often found it quite distracting. There were many continuity problems throughout. If it was meant to add another dimension to the film, it failed. Instead it was distracting and gave the impression that they ran out of time/budget more than anything else. The plot is largely obvious from early on. If it takes you more than 15 minutes to work out what is going on, there is something wrong with you. OK, the full extent of the revelations at the end is harder to divine before it's revealed but the thrust of it is obvious. The film was, as you'd expect, beautifully shot and the cast was pretty good, although DiCaprio's Boston accent came and went at different times. The setting was also magnificent, which added to the overall effect. As a genre film, Shutter Island doesn't work nearly as well as others. Identity comes to mind as a far better attempt at the same kind of story. It's probable that it's strength is that it is not really a genre film and will, therefore, appeal to a broader audience. However, it is definitely not one of Scorcese's best. If I had to rank it, it would sit somewhere near Bringing Out the Dead.","

"nelson_keith","17 February 2010","I read the novel so I knew the story going in, and I still got chills in several places and really was moved at how incredibly good this movie is. I won't get into the plot, because that could spoil things, but Leonardo DiCaprio investigates a missing patient/inmate in a top-secret island fortress for the criminally insane. He keeps getting frustrated as his interviews with doctors and patients raise more questions than answers. Ben Kingsley, who plays the primary doctor on the island, deserves a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, and we will see how far the rest of the cast and movie will go into next year's awards.The best comparisons for me were the Shining, for the psychological horror aspects of both movies. And a little bit of Silence of the Lambs, when the hero goes into a row of cells to talk with one of the inmates/patients. DiCaprio is good, but not up to the level of a younger Jack Nicholson, who would have been absolutely brilliant in this part when he was in his mid-thirties.I am not sure if someone who hasn't read the book will be confused by some of the story... or simply be blown away at how it unfolds.I have seen all of Martin Scorsese's movies and this is one of his top 5 or 6, better than Cape Fear, Aviator and the Departed but a hair below Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver.This is a very scary movie, the truest horror film Scorsese has ever done. I can't recommend it to my wife or otherwise squeamish viewers, there are too many terrifying moments for them to enjoy it.What a great movie, I will surely see it again in the theaters. Haven't seen one twice since the Hurt Locker, and before that one it's been 10 years.","

"Robert_duder","8 July 2010","Everyone I ever spoke to that had seen Shutter Island raved about it. I don't disagree that the film was very entertaining and a solid thriller but I felt like maybe people saw more originality in it than I did. It was well worth seeing and impressed me so don't get me wrong but it wasn't a mind blowing Scorsese classic in my opinion. In fact I think this was one of Scorsese's more mainstream films, although I've never really seen him as the 'amazing' 'monster' director everyone else does. I usually find he tries too hard to be unique. Still Shutter Island's creepy setting, and isolated prison is very well done and keeps you enthralled. The entire film happens on Shutter Island but you won't soon be tired of the setting as it takes the lead character from the prison like rooms to the coast of the island and back. Add in the time period of the mid fifties, and then toss a Hurricane at the Island to boot and you have the perfect suspense thriller setting to keep things moving. But by the time you add some of these key features it might start to feel a little predictable which you don't really expect from the film or from Scorsese. You can say a lot about him but predictable isn't usually his alma mater.Leonardo DiCaprio, who truly impressed in Scorsese's previous smash success The Departed (see my review), and is great in his role as U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels. You very quickly realize that something far more sinister is at work through the eyes of DiCaprio. Despite a solid supporting cast the film does really revolve around him and if anything you can say that DiCaprio can carry a film. He is very watchable and always gives a roll his all and makes everything seem mysterious in the film. Mark Ruffalo plays DiCaprio's new partner and right off the bat his vibe is one of mystery. Ruffalo has really honed his acting skill over the years because I used to find him downright dull but he really is showing some spirit. He plays a great role and has solid chemistry opposite DiCaprio. A master of his craft Ben Kingsley seems like the ideal choice for Shutter Island lead doctor Dr. Cawley. And indeed he is however somehow I expected for maniacal behaviour from him. But in essence that does defeat the purpose of the story. Kingsley gives a solid very interesting performance. On top of that the amazing Max von Sydow plays Kingsley's partner in a small but very effectively disturbing role. John Carroll Lynch has a small role as well but is really excellent as the Deputy for the Island. In fact I would have liked to have seen him more in the film.Shutter Island's big hook is the twist to the whole story and the unravelling of the mystery. My issue is that the final solution is really a bit predictable and not very exciting. I don't consider myself very smart when it comes to solving cinematic mysteries but I think I had it all figured out by the time the ending rolled. I don't know what I wanted from the ending but with the set up and the creepy atmosphere of Shutter Island I guess I felt a little bit let down. With that aside you won't be disappointed in seeing Shutter Island. Maybe I had high expectations given how many people raved about the film. If you're looking for a solid thriller or even something with a dash of horror film then you won't be disappointed with Shutter Island. 8/10","

Dennis Lehane (Novel).Directed by Martin Scorsese.This is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen.At first I didn't like it at all. I couldn't stand the annoyingly loud background score and the artyfarty dream sequences. And right from the beginning I couldn't take to Mark Ruffalo's character, there was just something weird about him and his accent that I couldn't put my finger on.But as the movie goes on it builds up to an amazing and shocking climax. I didn't see it coming although I had a feeling something wasn't quite right! Looking back, this one is one hell of a cleverly constructed script and I'm guessing we have the original novel to thank for that. What started out as an annoying movie actually turned out to be really good and I want to watch it all over again to (without spoiling anything) see what references I missed.I still think it was a bit too artyfarty at times and that background music was too loud and annoying and there was something about the cinematography that I didn't quite like, but overall I think it actually worked.9/10","

"Horst_In_Translation","10 November 2013","Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" went a bit under the radar after the big hype ended as it was released right before Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio also. This adaptation of the Dennis Lehane novel turned out very nicely, however. The screenplay was written by Laeta Kalogridis, who was also in charge of the script to the infamous ""Alexander"", but if her talent was somehow in question, it's all been made up by her work for Shutter Island. Some people say that Scorsese needs to move on to another recurring lead actor than Di Caprio, but I say, if Shutter Island has any kind of influence in that decision, he should actually be working with nobody else. ""Shutter Island"" runs considerably over two hours and DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels is pretty much in there from start to finish and commands the screen incessantly.The whole supporting cast did a decent job as well, some more, some less. I'd like to emphasize especially Ben Kingsley whose work with Scorsese here and also, more recently, in Hugo worked out incredibly well. In this one, he plays the head of a mental hospital and seems to have a great time portraying that character. I definitely had a great time watching him. He was so much fun in all his scenes, in the more serious scenes, but also for example when he keeps giggling about the interactions between DiCaprio's and von Sydow's character. This was maybe the only one whose significance I really didn't see, which is a shame as von Sydow is without a doubt a very good actor. He's a bit of a link for the main character back to his time as a soldier and I could have done without these parts as they did not add very much to the story. In contrast to that, Ted Levine (known from ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Monk"") proves again what an underrated, brilliant actor he is and totally dominates his one scene, in which he delivers Daniels and the audience a memorable monologue on violence.This was already the second or even third time I watched ""Shutter Island"", so the whole final twist wasn't new or refreshing anymore, but I remember being quite shocked the first time I saw it about how things unfolded and it was certainly good to see it again and pay more attention to details I may have overlooked earlier, now with the knowledge of what is going to happen. Apart from that, I'm fairly sure that I still haven't understood all that's beyond the surface, all the metaphors and symbolisms here and that's why it's surely a good choice for a rewatch. You discover something new every time. The setting is perfectly chosen and displayed: an isolated gloomy island that adds a truly claustrophobic note to the film. I was actually surprised how many songs were included. I hardly remembered any when the end credits began. I guess it's true that the best soundtrack is one you don't recognize. I felt the fact that there was rarely more than one well-picked noise, be it heavy rain or birds tweeting added a lot to how atmospheric this film was.As you certainly know by now, I totally recommend this film. It's a bit of a pity it was overlooked completely at the Academy Awards, probably due to its early release date in 2010. ""Shutter Island"" is exactly the horror/thriller I like. Give me something like that over bloodthirsty zombies running behind a gang of cheerleaders anytime. People say, Scorsese is past his peak, but if this film and ""Hugo"" are any kind of indicators, I'd say he's shining more brightly than ever. Hopefully he can retain this level for another 10-15 years.","

It is now the 21st century and i think the old dog should just fund movies and let youth take control of all aspects of film making.I hate the ""1 liners"" in this movie along with the overdone musical scores. sometimes silence and raw sound are better than an artificial orchestra.I'm a Leonardo fan but his weak Boston accent made his character lame, like a boy trying to play a man. Mark Wahlberg would have been the obvious choice here. Ben Kingsley earns 3 stars to save this movie from zero. He's always solid.This movie could have been excellent with a 21st century approach. I was waiting for Arnold Schwarzenegger to have a cameo and give some stupid one liner.Sorry, this movie is weak.","

"Floated2","15 October 2015","Shutter Island has been very critically acclaimed but several fans and critics alike. The film by director Scorsese has become a hit as it was released back in February 2010. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the lead for their 4th collaboration (up to that point), Shutter Island does tell a very interesting story, however the journey we see does not fully equal to what one would expect. As all of Scorsese films, the performances delivered by the leads and supporting actors are top notch, as well as the visuals and scenery. Though one would have expected more. By the finale, when the big twist is revealed, it does not feel as one is satisfied with everything that has happened, or we simply do not care so much. It was somewhat predictable with everything leading up to the conclusion. Perhaps as many have stated, Shutter Island could use multiple viewings and perhaps one would enjoy it more with another viewing. Though as it stands, I do not understand its hype it has received, as I do not feel it is an IMDb top 250 worthy film.","

It tried so hard to be clever, yet it hit you over the head with its stupid 'hints' and 'clues' when we had already guessed the guy was mad anyway (as were we for watching this pile of drivel) L de C spent the whole film with a painfully bewildered expression on his face (or was he just trying to figure out ways to get his name off the credits?)

"rchalloner","1 March 2010","I think this is just about as good as it gets within the psychological thriller genre. The whole cast are first rate and this has to be one of DiCaprio's best performances. Max Von Sydow is superb as always.The atmosphere is wonderful, Gothic and distinctly unsettling and the setting just perfect. The photography is beautiful and never over fanciful and the plot keeps the viewer engrossed for the whole two and a quarter hours, which is the sign of a great film. It is a return to the old fashioned thriller style, with relatively little in the way of special effects, which is one of its great strengths in my view. The detail is exceptional and not a frame is wasted. I can't say I like all of Martin Scorsese's work, but this is top stuff.","

"jwbeller","19 February 2010","I have to comment on this film since I was so disappointed in it. When I read the review this morning in the paper, I was sure I was going to skip it (the critic in the Washington Post panned it). However, later in the day I noticed on IMDb that it had a rating of 8.5, the same as Avatar, so I began to wonder if it might be good. I went to Metacritic and found it had a generally favorable score of 63, so I decided to see it. I could have gone to see Valentine's Day, which my friend had described as not as bad as he thought it would be.Close to two slow hours are spent in developing the story that had a very convoluted and unsatisfying conclusion. There was very little entertainment value in this movie, although the acting was generally good. The critic in the Post called the movie weird and I would have to agree. I would say that, if the story was better and the conclusion more satisfying, my rating would have been higher, although I would still not recommend this movie.","

"Vartiainen","18 July 2012","Martin Scorsese has always had the ability to pull his viewers in. His movies usually take place in a tormentingly bleak and familiar modern world, mixed in with small hints of grandeur, exotic and downright unfamiliar. Like so in this case as well. Shutter Island has a familiar feel to it. The idea of a mental asylum has been deeply ingrained into our collective cultural psyche and Scorsese uses that, presenting us an island that's both a cliché and something terrifyingly new. The colours are just a bit off, the characters sometimes step away from the roles that we have given them in our heads, the plot doesn't dance to the pipe that we all expect to hear. It's a harrowing experience at times, which is exactly the reason that makes the movie so interesting. The movie constantly throws us questions that we start to answer from our experience with these kinds of movies, but then we realize that the answer doesn't fit and we are left feeling lost and intrigued.Not to say that all of the twists are completely unexpected or even that original. It's a thriller after all and some genre conventions are still being respected, lovingly I might add. Scorsese has the ability to raise the ante, make us question our decisions and expectations, and at the same time make us guess and ponder about the case. Which makes for a great thriller. Add in some really nice acting, very nice editing and cinematography and a score that's just right for the mood, and you have in your hands an excellent film. Though I personally didn't care for the constant flashbacks as I thought that they broke the mood, but afterwards I could see their purpose, so my singular big complaint was reduced to a nitpick.All in all not Scorsese's best film, but a great piece of film-making, nonetheless. It's everything that a thriller should be and keeps surprising its viewers all the way to the end.","

I read so many rave reviews and everybody told me that I had to see this movie, the ending was wild and I'd never ever guess what it was and all that. Sadly, within the first five minutes I realized it was just an updated version of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, announced that DiCaprio was insane and all that, and infuriated my friends.I do understand and respect why many people adore Shutter Island. My opinion may be different because I saw Caligari first or it may be because I'm a fan of silent films, but whatever the reason, I find the original more exciting to view.","

"tlooknbill","21 February 2010","This is the kind of thriller Scorsese tried to make where the viewer is lead through the plot from the trauma induced, delusional perspective of the main character, only there's too many flashback distractions to make any sense of it all. The flashbacks are what gave away the end for me. I knew it pretty early on in the movie.However, the premise is fascinating from another perspective they only touched upon which is the idea of how anyone could be brainwashed into thinking and doing anything if given the proper support system much like what happened in ""The Manchurian Candidate"". I actually thought that was where it was going.What's not explained in the movie is from where the main character is deriving his delusions while participating in the mental hospital's roll playing therapy experiment. What induced the delusion to roll play as a US Marshal? Why choose to be a US Marshal? Was this his occupation before the actual trauma occurred that caused his psychosis? What was the seed of information that caused him to delude specifics like imagining finding a former doctor hiding out in a cave whose escaping a delusion of her own. Why would shooting your wife for drowning the children cause you to make up all that stuff? Usually in movies there's a seed of reality and logic that starts the spiral downward toward paranoid delusional psychosis this guy was experiencing. To many holes in the logic for me to suspend my disbelief.Great idea for a movie, though. It's just clumsily executed.","

"Psalm52","20 February 2010","For a pseudo-noir film where ""God"" is mentioned in passing half a dozen times, Shutter Island has the same feel as a vintage Twilight Zone episode. The ones introduced by creator Rod Serling. There's a twist ending coming, for sure, but where-as the black and white series delivered some well-written, unexpected surprise endings, on Shutter Island blatant hints deter from any plausible surprise twists coming. Michelle Williams does nice work in her haunting role, but the truth about her character's demise lands like a thud when it's revealed. Jackie Earle Haley delivers crackling tension in his cameo, but that's the problem. It's just a cameo, and his character is leagues more interesting than the rest of the ensemble. Scorsese handles the direction well, but this is not like 'Cape Fear' at all! There is no Max Cady running loose. The musical score evokes feeling, but the story itself lacks any component of Faith or discussion of ""God."" Such a shame for a film that searches for truths to the protagonist's dilemma, a la 'Identity' with John Cusack, and ends unsure of what ""truth"" is.","

"jonathanr95","16 June 2015","'Shutter Island' is a Martin Scorsese film about a federal officer, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who visits a high-security hospital for the criminally insane, and this facility is located on a remote island. This setting immediately establishes a feeling of bleakness, isolation and dystopia, which amplifies greatly as 'Shutter Island' progresses. I think that Scorsese's maintenance of the grim atmosphere is one of the strongest qualities of the film, but this hard exterior belies the hollow psychology of 'Shutter Island'. The dark exploration of the mind doesn't hold a candle to 'Taxi Driver', nor do the twists live up to 'The Departed'. I felt as though the portrayal of insanity in 'Shutter Island' was a little too cartoonlike, seeming to resemble something you'd find in Gotham City. This discredits the film, in my opinion, and makes 'Shutter Island' feel very hollow and superficial at times. There are one or two satisfying twists throughout the film, but I don't think that they sufficiently compensate for the tedium of the first half. DiCaprio's objectives in the film seem ambiguous at times, and, combined with the barrage of flashbacks and hallucinations, 'Shutter Island' often feels like a video game played inattentively. The film isn't a disaster, though, as the editing is very enjoyable at times, and Scorsese's creation of the cold, dystopian landscape has to be commended. I just wish that this film was a little more 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' or 'The Silence of the Lambs', and a little less 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'.","

"siderite","26 April 2010","If you abstract away the performance of the actors, which was brilliant, the imagery, which was most of the time very good, although sometimes over the top, the movie is a pretty straight forward example of a type that I personally dislike. Telling you what type that is would spoil everything, so I'll just give you this: prepare for an ending that might suck.That being said, let's not abstract the actors yet. Leonardo de Caprio played very well, with a performance reminding me of The Aviator, while the supporting cast, even if having rather limited roles, did their job very well. If you look at the distribution, though, it was only to be expected.The way the movie was shot was very nice, with images both visually nice and emotionally charged. Sometimes, though, special effects and scene manipulation went overboard, as is the case with the dreams and the scene when the German soldiers fall in the same rhythm as the camera moving...Bottom line: if the idea behind it doesn't annoy the crap out of you, then you will probably like it.","

"3xHCCH","24 February 2010","""Shutter Island"" is an excellent film! From the opening scene, it had me interested. With each scene that unfolded on the screen, that interest does not let up. Something new comes up to confound, to confuse and to obfuscate. The film follows US Marshall Edward Daniels as he investigates the disappearance of one prisoner/patient in the island prison complex for the criminally-insane called Shutter Island. I cannot really say anything more without spoiling it for you. This film needs to be experienced first-hand! This is classic film-making by Director Martin Scorsese. His visuals are just riveting and disturbing. His approach to story-telling is impeccable. Your brain keeps on working while you watch it. I want to watch it again to get all those small details I may have missed, and I know there are many. I think I may have already watched the Best Picture of 2010, and it is only February! Leonardo di Caprio, what can I say? He is such an intense actor. Since his recent series of serious films, from ""The Departed"", then ""Blood Diamond"", then ""Revolutionary Road"", now this, he just keeps on improving his craft. I was sold about how he tackled this most challenging role of Edward Daniels. I think he is on track to finally winning his Academy Award for Best Actor.The supporting cast composed of Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and the venerable Max von Sydow was very effective. Michelle Williams was haunting and creepy. I cannot even say what their roles are without risking to spoil things. It is that good that way. The film is very original. It is mentally-stimulating. Just the way I like my films.","

"dromasca","12 July 2012","Islands are terrific settings for thrillers. We know it from our own cinematographic experience, and we know we are in claustrophobic territory from the very first scene of this film, with the Shutter Island somewhere out of Boston in the mid-50s appearing in the mist under the gray oppressing skies. In Polanski's previous film or in the first series of Millennium there was a bridge to connect the island with the continent, here there is no bridge and a storm will soon cut any connection with solid ground and any way for the characters to get back to the safety of their routine existence. If there is one.There are a lot of Hitchcock quotes in this film of Martin Scorsese, we almost may characterize it as a Hitchcock film directed by Scorsese. The setting of the film in the 50s reminds immediately the great films of the master of the suspense from that period, and the main character, a US marshal sent to investigate the impossible disappearance of a patient in a special asylum, where criminals are treated for insanity using modern psychoanalytic methods behaves for a while as one of these Hitchcock heroes whose sanity is placed under doubt, but we know that it is not them but the world around that became crazy, and tries to pull him into its lack of sanity. Is this the case here? Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead role, I am no fan of his, but I confess to have liked immensely his acting here. In a film where nothing is really what seems to be, where the reality and terms of reference change slowly to be completely swapped by the end, his solid but very nuanced acting is critical and sustains the film from start to end. DiCaprio is present in every scene in the film, because what we see is what he sees, and what he feels starts to infuse into us viewers as the film progresses. His perception of reality becomes ours, his flashbacks bring his past under our eyes, his visions and nightmares end by hunting us.There are many beautiful scenes in this film, ideas, shots, dialogs that are all memorable. Acting from actors like Ben Kingsley or Max Von Sydow as two of the psychiatrists in the prison-asylum is positioning their characters against the evolution (or is it an involution) of the hero in search of the truth, which becomes a search of his own identity. If I am to explain why I was not completely happy with this film I would maybe blame its duration, the rule of 'way over two hours' which seems to have been legislated in Hollywood lately applies here as well, with no clear benefit. It's maybe a way to say - this is a serious and heavy movie- but there is no need to have said it in this case because the film is serious and catching and the final is hard to forget anyway. Less is better, here is another rule which could have applied. Scorsese makes great films, they need not be excessively long also.","

DiCaprio phones it in a little which sucks especially compared to Mark Ruffalo's overacting. Ben Kingsley does a great job though. Same with Max Von Syndrow who played the German doctor. He was clearly inspired by Casper Gutman in the 1941 noir ""The Maltese Falcon"" starring Humphrey Bogart and directed by John Huston. Just listen to the way he talks. ""My sir, you have excellent defensive mechanisms"" compared to Gutman's ""My sir, you are a most headstrong individual."" As far as neo-noirs go, their are many better ones. However, I would probably recommend Shutter Island.","

"Likes_Ninjas90","23 February 2010","Aboard a ship in the 1950's, a Federal Marshal named Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are heading towards Ashecliffe Hospital, a mental institution on Shutter Island. Ashecliffe holds some of the most criminally insane patients and it is reluctance then that Teddy must had over his pistol before entering. Teddy holds little remorse for the inmates. He is haunted by the memories of his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) who was killed by a firebug. When they reach the mainland, Teddy and Chuck are briefed by the ambiguous Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), who describes how a murderer named Rachel Salon escaped from her cell and has now gone missing. Beyond this disappearance though, Teddy suspects that there is something far more sinister occurring on the island and seeks to find evidence of it. He also suspects that the other doctor on the island, Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow), might be a former Nazi.The novel Shutter Island was written by Dennis Learne, who's other works Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone, were turned into immensely successful films. With the appraisal of these adaptations, along with a director as talented and as experienced as Martin Scorsese, the expectations for this film have been justifiably high. To the credit of Scorsese, his cinematographer Robert Richardson and regular film editor Themla Schoomaker, the film is stylishly constructed, with images that are haunting and other scenes that are just beautiful in their simplicity. The first vision of the island in its entirety is actually quite magnificent to behold. Yet through the fault of either Learne's novel or the script written by Laeta Kalogridis, this is overall a rather obvious and disappointing film, which does not stand up to scrutiny. At the beginning on board the boat, Teddy states to Chuck that he is his new partner and then begins to explain how his wife died in the fire. It is a rather odd start that so thickly describes what is happening. If the expository dialogue was limited to just this scene it would remain a minor fault. However, the film is so heavily laden with lines of dialogue that telegraph what is to come that the surprises and power of some of the biggest revelations are diminished. The writing is set well on and truly on the wall at the end, or more specifically Dr. Cawley's whiteboard, when everything is so neatly explained. There are more obscure dream sequences that distract and make one question what is going on but regardless, the twist is largely foreseeable and makes little sense in relation to the rest of the film. People will discuss this film for its own implausibility, rather than for a mature examination of mental illness.Frustratingly, the lack of subtlety extends from the dialogue, to the tone of the film and some of the performances as well. Shutter Island is a film so intent in submitting itself as horrific that it becomes outright tiring, instead of emotionally affecting. The film's overbearing, thunderous music score, foggy skies and iron gates, suggests doom and damnation in every way that has been seen before. The representation of mental patients is not a sympathetic one either, with some of them, such as skeletal woman with most of her hair missing and a man with a scar halfway across his face, looking like leftover peasants from a Zorro film. It is not particularly unnerving or scary, just a sensationalised representation and DiCaprio's performance is another example of this. There is no shortage of effort in his fourth reunion with Scorsese. Yet DiCaprio becomes almost exhausting as Teddy, relying on such an overzealous personality to carry the film. There is a possible explanation for this, but along with his lack of compassion in the film, it does not make him particularly likable or sympathetic. DiCaprio's weakness as an actor is that he has not physically matured enough to be able to immerse himself into any role, like Sean Penn or Philip Seymour Hoffman and the brief flashbacks to Teddy's army days in particular, highlight this. He looks quite out of place in some sequences. Ruffalo is thankfully more contained in his role and Kingsley is formal and proper, but also deceptive and ambiguous. It is a shame then that despite running at over two hours there is not a great deal of time dedicated to coming to know some of the characters more thoroughly.There is little doubt that both Martin Scorsese and DiCaprio will continue to make stronger films than Shutter Island. This picture suffers because of some poorly written dialogue and too many obvious hints. The subject matter could have been so interesting and contextual to the period but it is handled in such an unsubtle and obvious manner that the film just isn't as tense or as affecting as it should be. There are some interesting visuals and good performances but DiCaprio was not the right fit for this role. One must hope that if he chooses to partner with Scorsese for a fifth time, the role will be suitable rather than compulsory.","

I watch it every few years, since it came out, and I still find things that make me sit on the edge of my seat and excitedly point at the TV. It is so incredibly thorough down to the smallest detail and it keeps you glued to the screen. The depth of feeling and emotion Leonardo DiCaprio played in this is so beautiful and intense. It's infuriating to think of all of the outstanding work he has performed over the years and only just recently won his first Oscar. I believe he was absolutely deserving of one from Shutter Island, let alone his other performances.If you can, pick up the Blu Ray and watch the extra features after the movie. One of the coolest things to me was that they actually brought in the Medical Director from the now defunct, extremely notorious Bridgewater Hospital which was one of the most ill-reputed mental institutions in the United States. The fact that he leant his experience into creating the atmosphere and emotion from his own work into this movie was amazing.","

"Luigi Di Pilla","5 September 2010","After the many positive or too overrated reviews I thought Shutter Island must be a very promising thriller. But I expected too much and finally I rate this only five stars out ten. Why? The first half I wait and wait until something special happens. Then the plot is for me not hot enough to get adrenalin. Even the end let me cold and I could only shake my head. The story was even predictable that from the running time of two hours they could have cut at least 30 minutes. Director Martin Scorsese is the specialist to expand movies as he did already in The Aviator or Goodfellas and I definitely don't like extra long films. One sequence remembered me the cartoon of Tom and Jerry playing in the mysterious castle where the brain of the dog is switched in the cat or the sound of bird takes over the elephant and so on if you know what I mean.The dialogs were well adapted to the Fifties and Leonardo Di Caprio delivered here one of his best performance. Ben Kingsley is back again and was very believable in his role. Visually it was good too and the scenery well chosen. Avoid this overrated movie except if you are a Di Caprio fan. See instead the other lighthouse thrillers MURDERS BY NUMBERS or HALF LIGHT.5/10.","

"btacct","18 February 2010","My expectations were a prison movie with US marshals on the rampage story, little knowing that it was a psychological jig-saw puzzle. Often offering horror movie and holocaust atmosphere with lashing of blood rather than logic, you enter an on-screen game that references past glories of cinema (WWII movies, horror classics, concentration camps) and throwing them at you like the ever present debris of a storm raging on the outside walls of the institution and with screams of insanity from within, the movie unravels the mystery in our minds. The movie was truly brilliant.Filmed on an island off Boston (1954) during a fascinating period in history which has been mostly overlooked by film makers (end of war 1945 to 54), it shows an almost forgotten period in time, rich in costumes making you almost think everyone is dressed and ready for church or a funeral. Post-WWII, pre-Kennedy's, pre-rock'n'roll and the end of the Great American Song Book period with up tempo jazz/crooners, it was a period in history that has been left in the dormitory (or mental institution buildings of the movie) for so many years. The world was recovering from the end of WWII; the baby boomers were learning to walk or starting school; the baby boomers were 5 years from bobby socks. It was a rather sedate world that was awaiting the arrival of Rock n Roll.While watching it, I was constantly thinking Hitchcock and North By North West where Cary Grant questions his sanity against the background of a story that develops on screen - also similar to Vertigo and other Hitchcock where the main character suffers paranoia. In the background, there was an ever present suspenseful sound track reminiscent of again of Hitchcock and the literal cliff hanging scene.There were some truly disturbing images contrasted with absolute tenderness. In a few spots, I thought Leonardo was playing a weak role but as it works out, he is playing the character's weaknesses and flaws. For a moment, in one scene I thought he showed the facial expressions and mannerisms of a frustrated Jack Nicholson to brilliant effect.Great support cast including a few look-a-likes and almost circus caricatures. A prison scene shows a character looking like Robert De Niro in ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" but it is not him. The security guards and hospital staff were perfectly picked looking like main street cops and prison guards from 1950's USA. Hilarious and disturbing selection of extras as patients - they were straight from an old horror movie.Mark Ruffalo plays a different part as a breakaway from his usual rom-com roles. Great to see the past masters like Max Von Sydow and Ben Kingsley. Patricia Clarkson keeps popping up in movies these days as a careworn eccentric and her old world-style glamour. She usually plays the supportive wife, mainstay or consort of a lead but here plays a gutsy character role.A dazzlingly and macabre revelation was Michelle William's character (Dawson's Creek and mother of Heath Ledger's child) who was amazing as Leo's wife. A truly magnificent role for our sweet Jen Lindley: I kept looking for Dawson. Joey and Pacey; expecting to spot Jack and the baby - all grown up.","

"ctomvelu1","20 February 2010","SHUTTER ISLAND is based on a novel by popular mystery writer Dennis Lehane, who likes to add a gimmick or twist to many of his novels. SHUTTER ISLAND is no exception, and in fact contains several twists. Leo DiCaprio plays a federal marshal in the 1950s looking into the disappearance of a patient from a hospital for the criminally insane. The asylum is on an island near Boston. Once on the island, the marshal finds he can trust no one -- not the psychiatrists, played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow, and certainly not any of the staff. He also finds he cannot even trust his new partner (played by the affable Mark Ruffalo) who at one point warns him they could become permanent residents of the island if they don't watch out. To make matters worse, the marshal is subject to hallucinations. He sees his wife, who is dead. at every turn and has frequent flashbacks to his time in the military, liberating Dachau. Then a hurricane hits the island and the power goes out. Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is a psychological thriller with horror movie overtones. While on the long side, it moves at a decent pace and the special effects are first-rate. Your tolerance for this surreal and ultimately downbeat movie will largely depend on your tolerance for DiCaprio, (he is fine here, although I would have preferred Brad Pitt in the role), and the almost comical shenanigans going on in the spooky old asylum. And be warned: The movie gets pretty nasty, which Scorsese movies tend to. For those confused or disappointed by the ending, read the book. The book's ending is cut-and-dried, leaving no question as to what transpired. The movie's ending is left open to interpretation, which is certainly the director's and/or screenwriter's right.","

"vctesse","10 March 2010","The best thing you can say about this film is that it was true to the book--overwrought, predictable and talky. The second best thing you can say is that DiCaprio never dogs it, no matter what stupid mess he shows up in--Gangs of New York, anybody? And now this. He always comes to fight. The previews really made things look exciting, but ten minutes into the movie and anyone could see where it was leading. DiCaprio looked twitchy and unreliable from the start, and Ruffalo's snide tone when addressing him was a dead giveaway. So once again, we have the deluded murderer who constructs another life because he can't live with what he's done--and a whole bunch of histrionics. Plus rats! And Nazis! This is the kind of thing that Alfred Hitchcock and Norman Lloyd would have knocked out in 26 minutes.--In fact, I believe they did. It was called 'Premonition' and starred John Forsythe. Look it up.","

"crispin_13","6 March 2010","My subject line is taken from a review of Exorcist II: The Heretic but I have not come across a film to which it applied so aptly until now. I went to see this movie with expectations aplenty. An excellent cast and a tried and true director. The cinematography was good, the performances were good; therefore, I put all of the fault in the director. NOTHING HAPPENED. It was tedious and boring. I figured out the ending in the first five minutes which was ridiculously contrived and about as new and refreshing as the plot of a Friday the 13th movie. I expressed my feelings to my dad who told me that the book was exactly the same. Maybe Scorcese was true to the book which makes me wonder why they made it into a movie at all?! 40 minutes into the film I was trying to find enough light in the theatre to reflect in my watch so that I could see how long I had been sitting there- that's never a good sign. Avoid this one at all costs unless you are desperate to cure your insomnia.","

"loakman-3","19 February 2010","Just seen this movie about 2 hours ago and was so disappointed by the whole thing I just had to sit down and write my 1st review on this site!The trailer promised much but the movie delivered little, the convoluted plot hid behind many many dream sequences, never a good plot device!I expected more from this director but maybe its not his fault, I think that the main problem is the ridiculous story is just plain silly, there were 4 in our party and we all guessed the end, don't worry no spoilers! Suffice to say I did not like this film, I will not continue to tell you the plot as many others have already done so, I would just tell you not to waste your hard earned cash, trust me, if you see it, you will not want to see it again and that is not a sign of a entertaining movie experience!!","

"Abhinav009","30 September 2019","This movie blew my mind.
The movie begins with the protagonist, Edward Teddy Daniels, on his way to shutter island aka mental asylum. With him is his newly assigned partner, Chuck. What starts as a missing patient mystery soon reveals Teddy's own intentions to hunt down his wife's murderer on that island. One event leads to another until Teddy is convinced of a conspiracy against him that is preventing him from uncovering the real truth. He believes unethical mental experiments are being done with the patients there.
He then meets the lost patient in a cave, who convinces him about everyone being evil on the island and that they would do anything to not let him go. He swims his way to the lighthouse and confronts Dr Cawley. THIS IS WHERE THE PLOT EXPLODES.
As Dr Cawley begins convincing him that Teddy himself is just another patient affected by OCD, we the audience feel the cunningness in his attempt to mislead Teddy. But line after line, Teddy and the audience, slowly begin to accept Dr Cawley's version of tge story. THIS IS WHERE THE BEAUTY OF THE MOVIE LIES.....as in throughout the movie, both Teddy and we were under an illusion, and Dr Cawley's suggestions brought both Teddy and us out of our delusion...... Masterful.
So what could have been a dull insight into an OCD patient's life turned into a full length suspense-thriller.... just because of the way the entire events were arranged. Brilliant!!!","

"polos_are_minty","9 April 2010","I was looking forward to seeing this film, I had heard plenty of good things about it, and I know that some of the directors previous efforts are excellent films. I was also looking forward to seeing Dicaprio in this role, as recently his acting has improved so much that he is unrecognisable from some of his earlier films. However I was again disappointed, this seems to have been a step back for him, as opposed to forward. His acting swung from extremely wooden, to bouts of massive overacting.The film however does have good production values, and the cinematography is good. The film is a pretty standard idea for a psychological thriller, detectives hunting down missing person. It is however slightly different. The director deliberately uses a confining technique, setting the film on an island. It is a clever idea, it creates a sense of entrapment and helplessness. It also allows things to stay small scale, rather then the pan America man hunts some films of this type have become.The way the film is shot is interesting, there seems to be a reliance on flashbacks to push the story forward, which I think is not a good technique. Rather then finding out what is happening in the here and now, we are slowly drip fed information from the past not all of which is relevant. The set up is interesting, the two agents have not previously worked together, allowing for a better way for the audience to get to know the characters. As the characters relationships develop, so does our knowledge of their backgrounds.I have commented on Dicaprios acting, which I feel was poor at best. However I must add praise for Sir Ben Kingsley, who in my opinion is brilliant. The actor clearly appreciated the role, because his acting is great. Kingsley is truly the star of the show, and for me steals the lime light from the lesser Dicaprio. What is testament to his skill is that even the most awfully written scenes are delivered faultlessly, like the terrible scene in the lighthouse.The first half of this film had so much atmosphere, tension and power, I am at a loss as to explain where it goes to after that. But strangely everything seems to disappear after that point. The ending is predictably bad, I mean it seems to be a cheap imitation of so many other films. The ending is so cliché, that it was even used in The Simpsons as a joke several years before this films release. I'm afraid the use of the unreliable narrator was this time poor, it reminded me of the ending of Fallen. Which was in many ways better than Shutter Island.I still can't quite fathom what happened in the second half, and how they managed to waste such grand potential. I'm afraid this can be scored no more than 6/10","

"neerajpatodi","19 February 2010","Shutter Island is a movie with Martin Scorsese signature all over it. How fantastic direction can made ordinary plot interesting is the highlight of movie? Nice camera movement, shadow photography, multiple flashbacks and capable cast selection made this one worth watching.Even though plot of movie is not new, Scorsese was able to create engaging trill and suspense out of it. On top of that Lionardo once a cute Titanic boy again shows that he can deal with rustic role with same vigor and success. His eyes and facial expression reveals as much as the crisp dialogs do. He is one of the few actors who make acting looks so real. Only if editor kept it shorter than what it is, will make watching movie more pleasant. All in all, Shutter Island did a nice job and after Avatar, it will be another treat from Hollywood to watch this year. 7.5/10","

"honorhorror","26 May 2010","Spoiler alert first. This review is only intended for those who finished watching Shutter Island.First off, if you were freaked out by this movie, congratulations! You just became a new guinea pig after a few millions people who just saw it. My suggestion is, think again. Don't just resort to questioning your own sanity like some serious viewers. That's because the masterful Martin Scorsese pulled out a masterful magic trick in narrating, and fooled you into a psycho's shoes. The settings, atmosphere,performances, character studies are all fascinating, yet mind-provoking. The final twist will have no less effects than great psychological thrillers like Fight Club, Psycho, etc. That's also why I gave it a bow and a 9/10 on IMDb.Though the movie definitely gave us a lot of details suggesting the final revelation moments, we as audiences did saw those intentionally-made hallucinations as if they are real. Also, the whole atmosphere and the fact that the ways doctors treating mental patients are not perfect also helped building up paranoia. The main character, as we get to know him and his mental scars, are also put into these series of procedures which inspire paranoia as well. Like Hitchcock's masterpieces, this movie has a great assumption that insanity is a dwelling element in our society, which we can't weave away. This revelation may help us examining the philosophies behind this movie.Like Batman Begins, the movie's theme is also very religious, ""to save or to destroy?"" Such is the clashing point of the psychological doctors in the movie. It's just like an argument between an angel and a demon, yet if you watch closely enough, you will also notice that the ""demon"" side in the movie,the doctors holding that brain-paralyzing surgery is the best resort are surely cold-hearted, without much of a goodwill, not to mention any kind of love toward the patient.However, the ""angel"" side of the doctors are also not so good as we have come to assume. Ben Kinsley's character is essentially playing God in controlling and affecting the test subject's mind, yet the conditioning and controlling procedures in this so-called Role-playing game are marred by either lack of goodwill from the other side, or the very procedure which can torment the subject and generate some more paranoia out of him. So this story is basically a sad-sad beginning continued with a sad-sad ending, which has already been decided by the writer's pessimistic logics.I am definitely not criticizing the movie's authentication on a story level. In fact, the movie very honestly revealed one truth to us, that you only get to choose to be saved or to be destroyed in a limited time, and you won't be given another chance forever. That's because if you always ruin the chance of being redeemed, the whole life becomes a repeated torture, which is not so different from hell. Shutter Island definitely achieved in questioning the human's weak spot and make us scream inside or outside. Yet, the story lacked some very important factors, which I have been wondering since I noticed that none of the main characters revealed to have any religious belief and assumed atheists. Scorsese had been, according to my memory, mocking at or ignoring Christianity since his early movies. In this socially-concerned movie, he again showed this tendency. Simply put, simply believing in people's mind can choose to face the facts and turn to the good helpers, while factoring out God's saving grace, is a silly belief which beats itself. That's the very dilemma and failure Ben Kinsley's character met. Also, Playing God in this dreadfully set ""Role-playing-game"" also beats itself because you can't even be almighty enough to control all the chess pieces, like the movie had shown.That being said, I very much like to see everyone who's frightened by the movie to relax and have a good dream. That's it.","

"houndtang75","14 March 2010","Shutter Island is one of the biggest loads of old tosh I've seen in a long time. The twist - if you can call it that - can be guessed from the trailer and must have been seen at least 47 movies before this one. There is a strange, artificial feel to the whole film, with the crazily doom-laden music the icing on the bizzaro cake. How this 70s B-movie script attracted Scorsese, DiCaprio, Ruffalo etc who know - perhaps it was just an excuse to camp it up for a while. That said, it entertains in its way, despite its overlength and awkward plotting. Truly a bit of a curio, no doubt it will become something of a cult 'guilty pleasure' down the line.","

"paul_haakonsen","9 October 2010","Initially I had doubts about this movie because I have a thing against Leonardo DiCaprio. But I decided to get past my dislike and watched the movie anyway.And it was actually a great movie, especially the storyline and plot. It had lots of really cool twists and turns, and you were always left in the dark, with only sparks of chances of knowing what was actually going on. And that uncertainty really worked well for the movie. And I must say that I really liked the ending of the movie. Not your typically sappy Hollywood ending here.I must say that DiCaprio actually put on a great performance in this role, as much as I dislike his previous movies, his performance in ""Shutter Island"" was actually astounding. And of course, he was helped good on the way by Ben Kingsley, who also put on a magnificent performance.I haven't read the book, so I am not familiar with how true to the novel the movie actually is, but having read other reviews, it seemed that the movie is loyal to the book. But regardless, the result of this movie is a solid thriller with a really good story, and you are never given a bone as to where the story goes, and it is so unlike most other thrillers out there.There is something dark and foreboding about the entire setting of the movie - having a mental institute on an isolated island somewhere. And on top of that, the patients there are criminally insane. Just makes it all more interesting (and dangerous). And, for me, the setting was very believable and very well detailed. There was a certain unique style to this movie, and I loved the way it was shot - superb and interesting camera usage here.I surely was taken by surprise by this movie, and I recommend that you watch it if you haven't already seen it. Especially if you like thrillers that toy with the psyche and if you like movies that are totally unpredictable. I give it a 7 out of 10 rating because of the storyline and the setting, I didn't let my usual dislike of DiCaprio influence this rating in any way. So trust me, this movie is actually worth the time and effort.","

"pyrocitor","23 February 2010","It is always fascinating to see directors whose success is generally associated with a specific genre work outside of their usual subject matter, and celebrated filmmaker Martin Scorsese's work on Shutter Island is no exception. Despite the seemingly familiar use of police figures as protagonists, Scorsese instead contents himself from drawing instead from the realm of psychological horror thrillers rather than his usual milieu of police or gangster genres, without sacrificing his usual uncanny grasp on complex, nuanced characterisation or sophistication of narrative. As such, rather than a 'gimmicky' conscious departure from his realm of expertise, Scorsese's film instead feels like a fitting entry into his celebrated pantheon of work, only serving to further demonstrate his versatility as a director.In fact, for a director generally uninitiated into the field of anything resembling horror, psychological or otherwise (unless one considers the urban mental horror of his works such as Taxi Driver), Scorsese demonstrates an exemplary flair for working within the tropes of the genre. Taking clear influence from classic, 1950s B-horrors (in particular, the recognizably jerky editing and stilted expositional dialogue of the film's ship-set opening sequence feels directly lynched from Invasion of the Body Snatchers or another film of its ilk), the film makes its mark as a laudably daring experiment in temporal genre bending, all the moreso through its devious subtlety, rather than overtly hamming it up or overdoing nods to its influences. As the film progresses and the tension rises, it is almost a shame to see Scorsese abandon his previous hat tipping and segway into more conventional standards of quality and narrative development.That being said, as the overlap between reality and fiction becomes increasingly ambiguous and the psychological state of his protagonists becomes more and more frayed, Scorsese demonstrates a dazzling grasp on generating a captivating and horrifying atmosphere (most tonally akin to Lars von Trier's recent Antichrist of all things, albeit with less animal disfigurement) with its noxiously gritty 'real life' narrative and breathtaking, exquisitely stylized and horrific flashback or dream sequences equally adept at evoking piercing tension and overwhelming terror in the viewer. Thema Schumacher's masterfully neurotic editing and the boldly (yet fittingly) overbearing musical score all combine to create a stunningly Gothic ambiance, excelling in its rank filth and horror.As such, it is a desperate shame when the film finally lurches along to its culmination, as, despite generating an atmosphere so overwhelmingly powerful and a narrative fiendishly complex enough to genuinely leave the viewer guessing, it can't help but all feel somewhat wasted upon the revelation of an ending twist which comes across as somewhat insultingly over-obvious and unsatisfying - a twist so obvious throughout that the viewer finds themselves continually inclined not to believe that a film so sophisticated and stunningly stylized would succumb to it, thus being almost (but not quite) taken by surprise, but in entirely the wrong way. To his credit, Scorsese remains a directorial stalwart to the end and does his utmost to sell his ending, and as such its inclusion is not quite enough to derail the entire film, but it cannot help but feel like a glaring mistake in a film previously so impeccably poised to avoid every semblance of the word.Nonetheless, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another flooringly powerful and nuanced performance as haunted and psychologically threatened federal Marshal Teddy Daniels. Working with the film's pivotal role, DiCaprio's firebrand, nervy energy is a perfect compliment to Scorsese's heavy handed style, and his work in Shutter Island stands as further testament to his being one of the most trustworthy and downright powerful performers in the modern industry. Mark Ruffalo keeps himself on an impressive, appropriate slow-boil of clenched energy as Daniel's partner, and his uniquely understated charisma not only proves a perfect compliment to DiCaprio's frenzied performance, but also admirably sells an otherwise uninteresting 'straight man' role. Ben Kingsley hits the 'mysterious and aloof scientist with secrets' button hard, but manages to make it work, with his perpetually gleaming eyes retaining the viewer's interest and curiosity throughout. Max Von Sydow, while seemingly having little purpose in the film apart from adding to the general sense of unease (and unearthing an interesting piece of characterisation for DiCaprio) nonetheless contributes a suitably peculiar and foreboding performance. Michelle Williams excels in brief flashback appearances with fierce passion and desperation as Daniels' dead wife, and Emily Mortimer is captivatingly frightening yet sympathetic as missing psychopath Rachel Solonzo. Finally, Jackie Earl Haley is spellbinding in a single crucial scene as a schizophrenic murderer, managing to work enough frantic edginess, and strange, perverse sympathy into his performance to make his fleeting presence one of the film's highlights.As such, Scorsese's Shutter Island remains an overall masterfully assembled piece of film-making, if perhaps one destined to leave viewers somewhat unsatisfied and let down after such a stunning build up. Nonetheless, if the bulk of the film could be examined in isolation, the film would cement itself as one of Scorsese's most impactful and sublime films in a collection of many. As it stands, the film proves several cuts above most contemporary masquerades at psychological horror, but falls short of the eerie masterpiece it might otherwise have been.-8/10","

"xnrat","27 July 2010","I didn't like this movie. Not one bit.It started with the music, which was way too intrusive. Not moody, intrusive. You don't notice a good score, it just is there, blends in with the pictures and sets the mood. Here the score comes over to your table, insults your lady and spills its drink unto your lap.But the biggest disappointment was the conclusion. I will spoil it now, so bugger off if you haven't seen the movie. It was all in his mind. Great, I have never heard that one before. Mental institutions have become such a movie cliché that whenever I see one I know the big question will be whether what we see is all in somebody's mind.My tip: watch the first hour, the acting is really good, the sets are fine. When DiCaprio has his breakdown in Kingsley's office, skip to the end in the lighthouse and finish it from there. Although if you like hallucinations or take drugs on a regular basis you might enjoy the crap that happens between those two scenes.","

Don't get mislead by some of the other reviewers who try to compare this movie's slowness to say, Hitchcock's Vertigo. Sorry, but no way is the comparison even close! Don't waste your money on this one folks...even if you're a die hard DiCaprio fan.Get the DVD out of your local library for free instead.And by the way, I'm a huge Scorsese fan so you know I'm totally disappointed.","

"harry_tk_yung","11 March 2010","Fully recognizing that to some it is sacrilege to express any emotion less than total awe and elation to Martin Scorsese's pictures, I must express not so much disappointment as the lack of any particularly strong feelings after watching ""Shutter Island"". It's a solid piece of work and an entertaining movie but that's about all, coming from Scorsese.While there are red herrings in abundance, a seasoned moviegoer should not find it difficult to recognize this movie to be what it is – a psychological thriller. The setting is a familiar one: the protagonists are trapped in a mini universe closed off to the outside world, and things start to happen. The classic case is Agatha Christie's ""And then there were none"" (a title evolving from a couple of politically unwise ones that were abandoned), the tale of ten ""guests"" invited to spend a night on an isolated island. While the venue can be anything that fits the bill (e.g. the space ship in ""Alien""), it is here also an island, the titular establishment that houses a hospital for the criminally insane. There is also the almost mandatory motif of a location signifying final horror (such as Mount Doom in Mordor), actually two successive ones here: first ""Ward 3"" and then the ominous lighthouse.Federal agent Teddy (Leonardo DiCaorio) together with a new assistant Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) has the mission of investigating the mysterious escape of an inmate, a woman that has been put there for killing her own children. It goes without saying that there are more that meets the eyes. For a start, Teddy has his own haunted memories of a wife who died in a fire started by an insane criminal who is now purportedly on the loose. There are various other plot lines and the fun for the audience is of course in trying to pick out the true scent from the red herrings. The final revelation is neither brilliant nor dumb, but just serviceable. There are of course some who insist that there in one more layer of truth beneath. There will always be – after all, one is entitled to believe that one gets extra value for the money paid.This movie provides a good platform for displaying some excellent acting, although not quite Oscar level (but who knows?) It's good to see DiCaprio maturing to a point where you almost forget completely the pretty boy image with which he was once associated. Ruffalo has proved to be solidly reliable in just about any role he takes. Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow dominate the scenes, whenever they appear, with the enigmatic and intimidating the roles of authority they portray. The three women Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson, all first-rate actors, demonstrate why they are with the three characters they play, imaginary or real, each with its own brand of neuroticism.","

"DarkVulcan29","24 February 2010","The story is set in 1954, Two federal Marshalls(Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Ruffalo), are assigned to a case on Shutter Island, where at a mental institution, a patient disappears, without a trace. While there investigating, they discover things are not what they seem, has every twist and turn keeps coming into play, and knowing who to trust and who not to trust, but the main twist of the whole story, is the one that will shock you the most.Martin Scorsese brings the suspense of Alfred Hitchcock, and weird artiness of Stanley Kubrick, and does it quite brilliantly. Leonardo Dicaprio is quite brilliant here, he really throws himself out there. And the supporting cast are also good, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, Max Von Sydow, Emily Mortimer, Jackie Earle Haley, and Patricia Clarkson. This is a thriller you should check out.","

"kuciak","7 July 2010","Watching Shutter Island, I asked myself the question who might have been a better director for this movie. I thought about a director like Sam Fuller, (someone Scorcesse admires) and I even thought of some possible obscure directors, who might not have had a huge budget, and would not have been able to shoot some of the scenes on their budget. Watching the film, like another writer here has pointed out, you think of the famous 1919 German film, The cabinet of Dr. Caligari, I also thought of the overrated 1970's British film, The Wickerman )esspecially when the lead character is going to the lighthouse. Also came to mind, a film which I think is superior to this, the 1987 film Angel Heart.Is Scorcesse paying homage to these films, maybe. Before the film even began, I suspected Dicaprio's character would turn out to be a patient on Shutter Island. The poster for the film also seemed to be to much of a giveaway. Part of the problem I have with the film are the flashback sequences to the main character. Yes we know that his wife is dead, but for the director to have to show these scenes, and to have hallucination type scenes ruins the film, as we are clearly going to realize that Shutter Island, is not the search for a missing patient, but is about the mind of the Dicaprio character. Worse still are the World War II scenes of concentration camps, as if trying to give greater importance to a thriller. When the final denouncement of who the Dicaprio character really is, it should come to no surprise to the audience, if they are surprised, they certainly haven't seen many movies.I wondered watching Shutter Island, what a great 1950's or 60's low budget film this would have been. What if some producer had given some money to a gifted director who just wanted to make a good film, and the producer said ""Here is the money, go make the film, but don't go over this budget. Perhaps a taunt and shorter interesting thriller would have been made, and the events of the Dicaprio characters past, would only have been discussed, except for the important final flashback scene. I think such a film might be discussed some 50 or 60 years latter, which I don't think this film will achieve.I enjoyed Shutter Island for awhile, there going to the Island, and introduction to the Island was fine, but after the scene where we see Mr. Dicaprio talking to his dead wife, her turning into ashes into his arms, it was downhill from their. The scene was so over the top. The last hour of the film, I just wanted it to end. The ending scene however is poignant, and Dicaprio's last line memorable. Some have even suggested that Scorcesse was paying some homage to the RKO produced Val Lewton horror films of the 40's. If so, what Mr. Scorcesse has forgotten is that Val Lewton did not have a great deal of money to throw around like he does, and probably made more superior films that Shutter Island.","

"jzappa","2 June 2010","Shutter Island begins encircling us with the first sinister notes even under Paramount's logo. Like the ensuing film, they're menacing. This is Martin Scorsese's haunted house movie, given the insatiable quivering apprehension we sense when thrillers don't defuse all the suspense with action sequences. He's a master of accompanying image with music. This is one of his very most effective endeavors in music placement. He seizes the piano and strings of a minor piece by Mahler for every drop of its sensory character, waxes Kubrick with Penderecki's dissonant clusters, finds parallels with John Cage's hypnotic incoherence, the steady tonal pulse of Ingram Marshall.Shutter is an obscure, jagged island off Boston, where a Civil War fort has been acclimated to a prison for the criminally insane. We close in by boat under descending skies with Marshals Teddy and Chuck, played by the strikingly symbiotic duo of Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo. They're to inspect the vanishing of a childkiller. There appears to be no way to escape the island alive. The evasion of one prisoner might not necessitate the involvement of Feds unacquainted with the circumstances, but we never question that element. Not after the foreboding enclosures of the prison appear, the investigators guided into the office of Dr. Cawley, played by Ben Kingsley with that ominous charisma he's gotten down cold in his career's latter half, continually deflecting all Gandhi-typecasting.Experiencing the novel before the film was my mistake. It took four theater viewings to completely separate the two. The film's more lavish, much less concise than the unfolding, and especially closing, of the book, but there are stunning additions by Laeta Kalogridis that flood the film with thematic alarm bells, making it resonate more deeply and pensively than even the revelatory rattling of the novel. Scorsese chisels through the real world inch after inch. It's plain that Teddy has no notion of what he's getting into. The premise seems elementary: The woman's missing, Teddy and Chuck will search. But the frigid concrete walls ensnare them. The offices of Cawley and staff, equipped for war commanders, look thinly modernized from silent Fritz Lang or Robert Wiede films. Flashbacks convey Teddy's torturous experiences since WWII, which provided classic noir's bleak percussion. Shellshock could be seen in men struggling to appear self-assured in their veneers of undistinguished outfits, heavy smoking, fedoras worn low. DiCaprio and Ruffalo both assume this appearance. While Ruffalo purposely seems more like a disposition than a character, DiCaprio fittingly makes it feel more like a buoyant front.DiCaprio commands some astonishing emotional scenes, modulating sharply between suspicion, aggression, bewilderment, agony. Had Paramount not postponed the release to a less Oscar-wary date, DiCaprio would doubtlessly be nominated. Indeed, the entire cast is outstanding in performances so unusual in substance. Many are figments, double-blinds, imposters, even mere functionaries. But all color Teddy's journey so dynamically. Michelle Williams effectively embodies a broken dream. Ted Levine inhabits an ominous duality as the Warden, who arguably may define the loonies-running-the-asylum cliché, but is he so loony? Maybe he's seeing more clearly than everyone else. Patricia Clarkson looks so unlike herself, possibly because her scene seems so convincing, yet so off-kilter. Emily Mortimer and Jeffrey Dean Morgan could be all Teddy's looking for, yet both baffle and intimidate him, and us.There's a flashback merged with a dream that may be the closest Scorsese has ever brought me to tears. He uses Max Richter's tender strings, loss literally raining all around Teddy and the wife that'll only be real, in his arms, for another few moments. Scorsese's never done a scene remotely as surreal, or romantic, before. It's astounding seeing him extend his breadth into untapped territory. Indeed the film's foremost impact is on one's senses. It's a premonition of disquieting enigmas: How did this woman escape from a locked cell in a sealed ward, its panels able to endure cannons? Why do Cawley and the dubious Dr. Naering, played by 81-year-old Max Von Sydow---who I'd still dare not mess with---feel like they're lying? Why do the prison's practices spark Teddy's flashbacks to freeing Dachau? These sorts of wringers are at film noir's core. Characters never enter a noir without some major burden. They have unresolved dilemmas, submerged anguish. Nevertheless, why are the others so odd? Kingsley tastefully bleeds intimidation whenever he smiles, then mixes his signals with kindly etiquette so gracefully that he might as well be wiping off the menace with a silk handkerchief. Not to mention two supporting actors, most memorably psychopaths in Zodiac and The Silence of the Lambs, here play lawmen.There's electrifying imagery in Shutter Island. There's a lighthouse, a cave on a cliff, dizzying falls to waves pounding on rocks below. A storm draws nigh. Light drips through clouds. The wind seems sorrowful. That's what the movie is: Ambiance, foreshadowing, the deterioration of Teddy's self-assurance, even selfhood. Scorsese induces pure dread, in various keys. Sculpting Robert Richardson's grandiose, angular, intensely colorful cinematography is Thelma Schoonmaker's trademark use of manipulated speeds, freeze-frames, those dang flashbulbs, as well as the ever more discriminating and poetic use of the cut from one shot to another that we always find in Scorsese's work.Some either think the ending doesn't hold water or the movie building towards it doesn't. What would be more gratifying? Compared to other films with similar twists, Shutter Island is much more understated, without the urge to repeat earlier moments for redundant effect during the revelation, which instead is played gradually, dawning on us. This is all of a story, even the pieces that don't seem to click. One's inclination is to distinguish what goes before, and make rational deductions. However, what if you can't peg precisely what went before? What if there were concealed things about various characters? What if the movie's perspective isn't objective but splintered? Where can it all go? We wonder. So does Teddy.","

"fernandoschiavi","6 February 2022","Based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, author of other literary works that resulted in film adaptations of good caliber such as About Boys and Wolves, Isle of Fear is a crime thriller with an extremely macabre tone to the point of being sometimes even difficult to watch, but which challenges, under the guise of suspense, our perception of reality. In 1954, federal police officers Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) set out to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Rachel Solando, an inmate/patient at an island's psychiatric unit - actually a large boulder, a ""bombed"" version of the famous Alcatraz - on the coast of Massachusetts, finding a hostile environment both from the psychiatrists, Drs. John Cawley and Jeremiah Naehring, played by Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, and from the prison officers and criminals interned there. And that's not counting the violence of nature itself, with a very strong storm that doesn't take long to start and that reflects all of Teddy's mental confusion that already starts with his discomfort on the ferry on the way to the island and that only gets worse.Dark and claustrophobic, Shutter Island starts from a well-arranged plot already in the pages of Lehane's novel. However, what makes it a less common cinematographic work is Scorsese's ability to bring it into the realm of moving images. Throughout the film, there are memorable sequences, such as Edward and Chuck's frightening arrival at the prison, which recalls the best of the 50's crime and suspense cinema - Alfred Hitchcock, Jules Dassin, Otto Preminguer, Fritz Lang, Samuel Fuller and Nicholas Ray appear, for different reasons, to have been references for Scorsese. The director conducts the plot in a way in which the viewer is involved, curious, and at the same time afraid of what is to come. This is the main characteristic of a good thriller: the connection with the audience.Robert Richardson's camera, Hugo, JFK and The Aviator (for which he won the Oscar for best photography), alternates panoramics, wide and grandiloquent shots to intimate, even invasive close-ups that confuse and deceive the viewer. At the same time, the indoor and outdoor shots gradually gain more complexity and labyrinthine characteristics that make the island complex, initially seen with a benevolent camera and a lighter and even colorful color palette, increasingly dark and oppressive, sometimes even just as terrifying as on the cliffs near the lighthouse and especially in Wing C, dedicated to the most dangerous criminals. The great art direction, led by Max Biscoe, Robert Guerra and Christina Ann Wilson, who does a wonderful job in creating the scary environment in which the film takes place. It's also worth mentioning the film's oppressive soundtrack, which also contributes to Scorsese's homage to the B-movies.Other brilliant moments in the film are Edward's surreal delusions, especially the one in which his wife dematerializes to ashes in his arms. And what about the scenes of Edward and Chuck inside the asylum's maximum security wing, which they manage to break in when the generator that supplies the island with energy fails? Great. There is also a special sequence, which shows a Nazi death camp, in which director, cinematographer, cast and art direction work in a dizzying way, showing us beautiful and shocking scenes. These few minutes focused on the 2nd. War can be heavier than many epics based on these conflicts. I also highlight the dream scenes between Daniels and Dolores, all plastically quite interesting.Furthermore, the script by Laeta Kalogridis, in her fourth feature, sprinkles the work of visual clues for the great final revelation that Scorsese materializes in a disconcerting way in the film, playing with perceptions, with memory and with the profound estrangement that the production causes. However, this same script is marked by a great imbalance. If the whole construction of the mystery works well - but perhaps more thanks to the visuals of the work -, the same cannot be said of its ending, which seems more like a race to reach the ""shyamalanesca"" twist. It's not even a question that logic is lost or that the events of the finale betray what came before, but rather that Scorsese can't efficiently keep up the rhythmic rhythm of the opening two-thirds, with the montage of Thelma Schoonmaker, his partner. Long-time professional getting lost in the back-and-forth, the intensification of action and the relative bureaucracy of ""explanation"".As secrets are revealed, tension rises and mysteries are unraveled. The script is well tied and the ending, despite surprising, manages to fill in the gaps left by the mystery. This does not mean that there will be no doubts, and the viewer will probably end the movie thinking about everything that happened, still digesting all the events. The story itself may not impress these days, but that's not Scorsese's proposal. The film takes place in 1954, at the height of the Cold War, after World War II, the horror caused by the death camps was still on everyone's mind, including the few scenes where DiCaprio's central character has flashbacks of his passing through one of these fields, which manages to be a stronger scene than many movies have tried to do with just that focus and have failed.Scorsese dominates the narrative by delivering fragments of Teddy's past, combining the tension of an approaching storm and all the tension present in the prison where everyone hides the truth. The director's trump card is to build everything slowly and with good doses of mystery, while letting his character practically suffocate in front of something beyond his control. There are discreet clues present in the script to situate the audience, such as the looks between some characters at certain moments or even the hilarious green tie of DiCaprio's character. It's the subtleties that reveal the truth, and yet, when the director allows the audience to piece the puzzle together, it's always a unique experience - and one that gets better with each review.However, it is by portraying the hero's torment as a result of his memories that Shutter Island really takes on the contours of a masterpiece: constantly bringing flashbacks and/or delusions in which the planes are dominated by suspended materials (snow, rain, ash or roles), the film illustrates the ethereal, fickle and distressing nature of Teddy's memories while, from a purely analytical point of view, fascinates by the brilliance of its symbolism - as in the moment, for example, when we see Michelle Williams partially and almost simultaneously charred, soaked and bleeding.Emotionally devastating in its final minutes (the shot in which DiCaprio appears hugging his three children, in the lake, represents the moment of greatest terror of the projection), Shutter Island still has an ending not only impeccable, but also enriched by a tragic irony.. Unable to achieve self-redemption (and how could he, after all he's been through?) and frustrated in his attempts to run away from himself, as his doctors insist on bringing him ""back"", Teddy finally discovers the way. Definitive way to leave his suffering behind - and his final speech already represents one of the most emblematic moments of Scorsese's career as it indicates the protagonist's decision to deliberately use the madness that had dominated him in the past as a farce that allows his self-destruction. And just as Nicholson's Jack Torrance was finally ""absorbed"" into the spirit of the Overlook Hotel in The Shining, DiCaprio's Teddy Daniels seems to decide that the labyrinth of insanity he'd used as a defense mechanism was the best he'd ever done for himself. - and it would be better to lose himself there forever than to be rescued and live with the tragic and monstrous nature of his own life.Dominated by a conspiratorial atmosphere, since all the characters seem to be hiding something from the protagonist, Shutter Island has a fascinating cast. It's interesting to mention how ideal Scorsese's partnership with DiCaprio is. Previously working on ""The Aviator"", ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Departed"", success is achieved again here, with the addition of DiCaprio's constant evolution as an actor. He does very well in conveying to the viewer the growing paranoia and panic that his character goes through. Daniels is a man who has been through a lot of traumas in his life and his stay on Shutter Island ends up exposing them to us and to himself in an overwhelming way. Mark Ruffalo presents himself in a very restrained way, despite having a scene in which the actor loosens up a lot in an important scene between him and DiCaprio. Michelle Williams, who appears only in flashbacks and in Teddy's dreams, appears quite artificial in the scene, being the weak point of the cast. Ben Kingsley is back in good shape with the ambiguous Dr. Cawley, a pleasant surprise. Max Von Sydow, with his powerful voice, has little less than a cameo, and it's sad to see him so little in the scene, even though he has a great dialogue with DiCaprio.Shutter Island is a highly recommended experience. The film's only flaw is that it appears to be longer than it actually is, but all the items mentioned above manage to overcome this problem. The feature represents cinema from a more experienced, more practical and more courageous genius. Tense, provocative and practically impeccable from a technical point of view, ""Island of Fear"" is one of the most underrated films in the vast and exceptional career of Martin Scorsese that goes deep into its themes that, even though already worked by the director, take even more contours. Dramatic thanks to the way it decided to approach them. In the end, we are presented with a film that reveals that our actions are not more powerful than the way we choose to face them. And after all, what would be worse: living like a monster or dying like a good man?","

"kunalkhandwala","5 March 2010","As the U.S. Marshals depart from Boston Harbor towards the isolated island that houses the Ashecliffe hospital for the criminally insane, the background music of the vessel's horns, the eerie mist and the uneasy countenance on them confirms that Martin Scorcese is going to squirm our thrill seeking minds....Author Dennis Lehane, whose notable works include Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone, provides the source for Scorcese's 4th and latest venture with Hollywood's finest – Leonardo Dicaprio. Shutter Island is a mind-bending, complex and multisided thriller that toys with your inquisitive side before revealing its dark form. U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) along with his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) are heading for the island to investigate the disappearance of a dangerous patient named Rachel Solando from Ashecliffe, aided by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). They are in a time when lobotomy surgery, inhuman drug experiments, mind-control conspiracies, the threat from the Hydrogen bomb and the after- effects of world war II have become the cause for insanity among several. Their investigation through interviews of other patients is a tiring psychological exercise that divulges little truth while the autocratic approach of Dr. Naehring(Max Von Sydow) restricts access to vital information. Frustrated and torn in disbelief, Daniels confronts the doctors in a futile stand against the authority on the island asylum. Teddy's apprehensions about the island's horrifying mysteries lead him to surprises that arise after the devastating hurricane shatters the island's structured order. The ensuing chaos is where he finds strands of truth for his convictions but in this quest, do things appear as they are or is he beguiled by the Hospital's secrets?Leonardo Dicaprio's renews his status of being the best in the business with Shutter Island. Playing Teddy Daniels required him to portray multiple characteristics that changed with the circumstances in the story. His keen understanding of the role and submersion into the director's vision enabled him to deliver such a stellar performance. Mark Ruffalo is commendable as Chuck while Ben Kingsley delivers the right amount of composure that looks convincing as a Doctor of the criminally insane patients. Watch them all together in the lighthouse where the truth is revealed through some very powerful performances. The rest of the cast that played Dolores, Rachel(s), George Noyce and Naehring leave quite an impact that blends with the film's turbulent theme of misdirection and evil. Shutter Island is a chilling thriller. The surprises keep coming and even if one has read the book or knows its suspense, Scorcese's direction can easily hold you to your seats with a great screenplay by Kalogridis. The cinematography brilliantly captures the essence of 1954 while portraying nature's wrath on the island during the hurricane. This is one of the rare adaptations of a novel that is executed page-by-page with the same depiction of every character, building, structure, plant, color, storm, cave and cliff that was visualized by the reader. To that, Scorcese adds his distinct style in Teddy's recurring flashbacks during the war and his last moments with his wife. Scorcese's display of blood looks artistic compared to the screen splattering in Tarantino's movies. Certainly there is a reason why the 40 film old director has a Golden eye behind his black frames. 8.508 on a scale of 1-10.","

"speedy-droid","26 August 2016","This little gem was worth an immediate Second Viewing, just to pick up on all of the ""little things"" that I missed the first time.It's easy to just throw around the name ""Martin Scorsese"", and assume that the movie is going to be good. But the truth is that... sometimes... Scorsese is absolutely brilliant.I haven't read the novel upon which this film is based, so all of my comments are based upon Scorsese's interpretation... not the novel, the Film.The beauty of ""Shutter Island"" is that there really is no resolution at the end of the film. Was that really a guy deluding himself, trying to escape from the horrors of his own life, or was he still trapped inside of a drug-induced hallucination? Nobody knows.He obviously knew, at the very end of the film, that by speaking to his ""partner?"", he was basically telling everyone that he had not been ""cured."" Was that a ""request"" to be lobotomized, so that he would never have to remember the horrors of his life again, or was it an acceptance of the fact that he would never escape from the island? Everyone assumes the former, but Scorsese leaves the question open.","

"prince_c3","19 October 2015","Well, pretty much good, better, best and worst has been said about this movie in 950+ reviews and it's kind of rare that reviews are somehow divided because as it happened after watching this movie my friend and I was totally engrossed and left the theater not knowing what really hit us. Because we were not prepared for anything like this from Scorsese or Dicaprio, we know they both are capable but not on this scale. At the same time two other friends outrightly rejected this movie as anything but great. So, that's how the audience would be divided you either liked it or you hate it. Also, those who don't like it much doesn't mean they don't get this movie or they don't know how to decide the movie, I believe they don't want something this hard to take it easy. They must enjoy comedy and light tragedy, but not something of this scale. Because I know my friends they can't digest dark movies with lots of emotions, emotions that involve tragedy, not some dog got killed and like that. And, by GOD from first shot to last shot this movie getting bleaker and bleaker until the last line which not only sums up the entire movie, but, it was so sad and bleak that I couldn't able to get off the seat even after it finished for few Min's.Making a tragic and dark movies is one thing, but making people feel the atmosphere, hopelessness, emptiness, the coldness, the suffocation feeling is not everyone's cup of tea, but Scorsese nailed it and you can almost start feeling yourself in that asylum and confined in that wall, you could almost feel the wet and cold walls of that Island and couldn't help yourself but look for an air to breathe.Mind that I didn't say a word about the story or what that movie is all about. It's about the human mind and complexity of human relation.Also, most important if you watch this movie as simply like Paranormal activity kind of horror, then you will wouldn't get the point or movie at all. At the same time if you don't give attention to the overall atmosphere, the time period, especially the dialog then you would definitely miss the movie and that's happening with my friend they totally missed the point because they watched it unprepared like any other horror movie genre. But, this movie is not a horror movie in a sense, but, it's scary to the core, not jump scary, but you would question the life of human and what human is capable of.Each and every dialogue are weighted and worth every second, but few of the dialog just stayed with me.When Warden told Teddy: If I was to sink my teeth into your eye right now, would you be able to stop me before I blinded you? Teddy said give it a try with a look. My goodness, that shows the true human nature.But the best one as per me is the one before credit rolls.When Teddy finally realized who he was and why he was here and his real identity, he looked at Chuck and said: Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?","

"Maziun","19 August 2013","I didn't read the book on which the movie is based. From what I've heard it's a great book . This movie is definitively not great . Anyway , the movie had advantage on me with the fact that I didn't knew anything about the story. The basic facts I knew sounded promising and despite that Scorsese in last years haven't been in good shape , I was still hoping for a good movie. It seems that not always you get what you wish for.The movie doesn't work for few reasons . First of all – Leonardo DiCaprio . I'm sorry , but he just doesn't fit for a guy with troubled past . He doesn't look manly enough . Also , he overacts too much . He shouts and makes a ""I have troubled past"" face too often . His role required subtlety he just wasn't able to give . William Hurt would be perfect for this type of role.I don't know was it DiCaprio overacting or Scorsese clumsy direction , but I was able to guess THE BIG TWIST after 40 minutes of the movie . Even if you aren't too clever , you should figure out at least in the half of the movie. If you haven't figure it out till the movie reveals the twist to the audience , it's done in so lame way that my head hurt. The whole revelation feels like Scorsese is explaining the twist to someone retarded. It's annoying and done in terribly amateurish way.Scorsese directs the movie badly . If I didn't knew that Scorsese was directing this movie , I would thought that it was made by one of those MTV-generation directors , like Bret Rattner. The movie should be dark , scary and emotionally engaging . Yet it comes out as flat , cold and Hollywood type of dark stuff. From what I've heard from the readers of the book they were heartbroken with the ending . Here it comes out emotionally empty . The movie just seems to flow from one scene to another in a soulless way. I was watching it , not experiencing it like I should.Mark Ruffallo gives a nice performance here , just like Jackie Earle Haley and Max Von Sydow. Ben Kingsley seems to be bored . There is some fine art-direction . The music is annoying. In the end you can follow the second interpretation what really happened . Not that movie is worth re-watch.I give it 5/10.","

"maximkong","18 November 2012","The world would be stupid if this movie is to be considered a very good psychological thriller/ twister. Come on, there are so many better ones.Let's compare this with Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds (about the same time), though not exactly categorized as a psychological thriller but similar to Shutter Island, relies heavily on the suspense/twist factor to win the crowd. Inglorious Basterds was successful in that regard, as I was not able to predict the next outcome because the sequence of events happened in an almost random manner; even if someone can predict it, he would find it difficult to catch up to the quick pace of the movie.Shutter Island, regrettably, gave off TOO MANY HINTS from the very beginning. I, at the very least, already foresee the truth during the 1st quarter of the movie. I know this is based on a novel, but Shutter Island's ending lacks the kick that Inglorious Basterds had, probably because the desired effect is sure to be tuned down once you figured out what was going on. If i were to edit this movie, I could easily remove certain 'spoiler elements', like firing Michelle Williams for example, and Shutter island would be a whole lot better. Fortunately, the abundant amount of twists (thanks to the convenient use of hallucinations) kept me watching even when I already knew what is going to happen.","

"bob-benoit","2 March 2010","Did I end up seeing a different movie than everyone else? I was shocked when I saw that Scorsese had directed this (I was unaware.) I think was by far his worst movie.The story line had great potential - once you ""know"" what really happened at the end. I thought the execution of the film was poor.The middle of the movie positively DRAGGED. I felt like I was watching Di Caprio and Winslet in Titanic, escaping from near death as the water rises - FIVE times in a row. I couldn't wait for the end.The end of the movie was needless to say muddled, which is probably intentional. We're meant to to REALLY know what happened. Was he crazy? Was he not? Was he poisoned and committed to protect the secrets of the island? Was he really an inmate undergoing a radical therapy? I can appreciate the film noir quality of the ending. It's just by that time I didn't care.There were lots of great clues along the way that don't make any sense at the time. But at the end when you look back they make sense (the blood from his wife's midsection when he's holding her ghost the first time.) And the idea behind a story like this is to make all of those clues fit the ""real"" story. Like explaining why they had to give up their guns at the gate. And why the guards were looking at them so strangely when they first arrived on the island.What doesn't make sense to me is the opening sequence on the boat. Why is that part of the story? If you're going to try out this radical new theory, and you have to ""start"" Teddy off in his fantasy somewhere (where he departs from the reality of being an inmate and starts the fantasy of being a Marshal investigating the escape), then why not just have him start off on the dock (as if he just arrived.) It has to start somewhere - you can't go back indefinitely. The opening sequence just doesn't fit the ""real"" story - only the ""fantasy."" I was VERY disappointed in the execution of the film as a whole.I wasn't alone either. Someone behind me muttered ""Scorsese needs a lobotomy"" as the credits rolled.I couldn't help but laugh and agree.","

"blacklist-1","23 April 2010","Shutter Island for me is the years best film so far. Leonardo Decaprio gives an outstanding performance as US Marshall Teddy Daniels set in 1954. Him and his partner Chuck Aule played excellently by Mark Ruffalo are on their way to Shutter Island, a closed off psychiatric prison for the criminally insane. Teddy and Chuck have been set to investigate the disappearance of a female prisoner who has escaped though the guards or doctors don't know how she escaped from the room. Arriving at the prison Scorsese sets up the tone of a dark, disturbing and mysterious place using non-diegetic sound and a haunting music score (one of the scariest I have heard) to deliberately unsettle us and it dosen't help when Teddy and Chuck have to surrender their firearms at the main gate. As Teddy and Chuck investigate the prisoner's disappearance their investigation leads them to believe there may be a sixty seventh (being only sixty sixth) in the first place. He begins to believe that the doctors and guards are conspiring in a conspiracy when they prove less than co-operative particularly the head doctor Crawley a superb part played by Ben Kingsley.Meanwhile as the investigation progresses Teddy and Chuck are shut off from the mainland due to a thunderstorm and Teddy has disturbing dreams of his dead wife and seeing images of dead children, which leaves him on a short fuse as also he is a recovering alcoholic. As the film progresses things get stranger and you know something is going on. This is fantastically told film with a complex plot (and a twist in the last half hour that shocked me to the core) superb acting and intelligent dialogue and script. Decaprio has been severely criticised by some for his acting but this is the best performance I have ever seen him give (even better than in Titanic) and he deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Shutter Island is an intriguing and complex thriller that will keep you guessing to the end with excellently acting and making. This is a masterpiece and will remain if the not the best then one of the best movies of the year and ever. If you like intellectual stimulation or a challenging mystery. I implore you to see this. Outstanding.","

"DonFishies","21 February 2010","There are only a handful of filmmakers whose work I compulsively follow and run out instantaneously on or near their film's release date to see. But there are very few filmmakers who can make a movie, not a predetermined blockbuster, feel like an event. Yet somehow, Martin Scorsese manages to do it every time. And when Shutter Island was delayed from October 2009 until February 2010, you can imagine how disappointed I felt. But it helped build the anticipation even greater.U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are sent to the titular island to investigate the disappearance of a patient at Ashecliffe Hospital in 1954. The hospital houses the criminally insane in various buildings, including some of the worst offenders in the country. As the pair begins interviewing doctors, nurses, patients and the like, they quickly realize not everything is right at Shutter Island. And with a ferocious storm heading their way and Daniels suffering from recurring hallucinations, getting out intact may be even harder than discovering the truth.Let me be clear on this, Marty Scorsese never makes bad films. He makes flawed films, he makes overly long self-indulgent films, he makes good films, he makes great films, and he makes brilliant films, but never bad films. Coming off his historic Oscar win for The Departed, it was clear Shutter Island was not even going to attempt to come close to repeating how incredible that film was. But in spite of that, Shutter Island comes off as a good movie but one that has flaws Scorsese easily could have corrected.The film is a slow burn of a mystery-inspired thriller. There are a lot of macguffins, a lot of inconsistencies and plenty of clues scattered throughout the film (almost surpassing the body count of The Departed), but it has a lot of trouble translating into something truly inspiring. When the film really begins unravelling and eventually hits its eye-opening climax, it becomes just as awesome as we all know Scorsese films can be. But for the most part, the content comes off as alternating between incredibly boring or incredibly fascinating. There is no middle ground at any point in the film, and I found the experience to be maddening in a lot of instances because the film just could not deliver on how incredible its trailer was. To me, Scorsese has always had a problem with the length of his films (looking simply at his last four films, two are pushing three hours in length and none are under two hours), and Shutter Island makes it incredibly clear how big a problem this can quickly become. For a thriller to be as riveting as it needs to be, it needs to keep the audience on its toes throughout its runtime. And unfortunately, Shutter Island only manages to do this half the time.Equally aggravating is the use of green-screening and special effects in the film. In some instances, it almost looks amateur in how badly edited some scenes are. It is fairly common knowledge that few films in 2010 feature the actors on actual sets but more often on special effects soundstages, but many of them trick the audience into thinking it is all real with some really good editing techniques. It seems these same techniques were only employed half the time for Shutter Island and with how much of a master craftsman Scorsese is, he really should have known better and put more time into ensuring the film looked perfect. And with a five month delay, there is next to no excuse for why some scenes cheapen the look of the entire film.But even if Scorsese is faltering as a filmmaker, DiCaprio continues to strengthen as an actor. He carries the film entirely on his shoulders, and never once do we take his conviction for granted. Daniels is a war veteran who suffers from hallucinations, and DiCaprio breathes depth, sorrow, anger, confusion and genuine fear into every frame he occupies. He is the focus of the entire film, and he fills its running time with a complex character that nearly makes his Oscar-nominated turn as Howard Hughes feel juvenile. The man continues to grow as an actor, and with each new role he takes on, he is moving ever closer to his eventual acting Oscar. And after seeing his whirlwind of emotions on display here and his emotionally devastating role in Revolutionary Road (the real film Kate Winslet deserved an Oscar for last year), I can only hope it comes very soon.The supporting cast is all excellent in their roles. Ruffalo continues to impress as a supporting actor. He has yet to truly master leading man status, but he plays off with DiCaprio better with each scene that passes. Max von Sydow, John Carroll Lynch and especially Ben Kingsley all deliver great performances as the main members of staff Daniels and Aule encounter. The three of them are just great alternating between being cooperative and sinister all at once. Michelle Williams is an even bigger standout, despite the trailer giving away her main function in the film. I would have liked to have seen a whole lot more from Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine, Elias Koteas and Jackie Earle Haley however. As great as they all are, they all appear basically in extended cameos. A little disappointing for how haunting their parts all turn out to be.If you can look past its boring sequences, the trip to Shutter Island is worthwhile. It is a good movie, but it falls short of greatness. DiCaprio is truly amazing in his role, but I cannot help but feel disappointed in the film as a whole. It easily could have been much better, but I think the five month delay ended up being more detrimental than beneficial for it.8/10.","

"vitaleralphlouis","15 July 2010","Martin Scorsese will continue to be worshiped by Liberals so long as they remember his profane Jesus movie. They are thus condemned to suck up to awful drivel like Shutter Island.Who could think that a movie about a mysterious island with a mental institution on it, being investigated by two hotshot federal agents; how could this be boring? Trust me, or suffer for it.Notning interesting happens after 30 minutes except a brief climb up a sheer cliff.Besides being boring, the movie is anti-American in its John Kerry-like spin that American soldiers mass-murdered the German guards at Dachau. Never happened, captain. Even though this is taken back later in the movie, the image of the lie stands tall.It is also one more movie that underlines the lie that World War II was about the death camps and the Jews. It wasn't. It was about the bombings of London, Rotterdam, the invasion of Czecholslvakia, et cetera. Seriously, nobody back then was concerned about the Jews.In Shutter Island, pretty much everybody goes nuts. Reality is mixed with hallucinations, but in no way is this made interesting.One last pot shot: I used to like Mark Ruffolo, but not anymore. Too many of these Hollywood empty-heads can't keep their traps shut. So OK just like Sheryl Crow and her one piece of toilet tissue tirade has ruined her music for me, so Mr. Ruffolo's desire that Bruce ought marry Kevin and that Megan ought marry Mary Ann. Go for it, Mark, if that's your thing; too late to put a sock in it.","

"edwagreen","1 August 2014","Brooding plot with a wonderful atmosphere of heavy rain and doom mark this film.While the acting is good by all concerned, you just know from the eerie beginning that the tables shall be turned on the supposed investigators. Is Leo Di Caprio living in a dream world, living a tragic fantasy or being taken to the cleaners? I thought of the 1944 ""Gas Light,"" when Charles Boyer was trying to drive wife Ingrid Bergman insane.That's what this appeared like until reality set in.For a film regarding mental institutions, we see very little acting out on the part of the inmates.","

"doctorsmoothlove","24 March 2010","Shutter Island is the newest reference point for why I hate movie trailers. Ever since September I was berated with flashing images of ""an asylum for the criminally insane"" while simultaneously watching some crazy person attack Leonardo DiCaprio. This had the effect of making me think I would enjoy a high budget horror or thriller from Scorsese. What I got was actually a noir film. Not that I am too angry, but why was the film advertised in a way that an audience could misinterpret its genre? As a homage pic, the film gushes with both stylistic and story references to the heyday noir films. It's even set in the early '50s.US Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) takes a case at Shutter Island (home of the criminally insane), an Alcatraz-like place, to investigate the disappearance of a patient. He is accompanied by a new partner and may have a personal motive to take care of. His wife recently perished in a house fire, and a suspect is being kept there. When he arrives, he is greeted by the enigmatic owner John Cawley (Ben Kingsley). Cawley says everything is under control and offers his help in the investigation. This investigation leads Daniels to many locales all of which feature overbearing, dramatic music. This intentionally distracting addition becomes its own character. Whenever it picks up, prepare to feel tense (you usually do). Scorsese knows how he wants us to feel and firmly places us into his preferred condition.Daniels suspects there is more happening than Cawley will admit. He imagines horrific Nazi-style brain control experiments may be happening. He continues going to different places as a storm brews. He is becoming too obsessed with finding out what is going on and sees ghastly images of his dead wife. He makes it to the place where the experiments are taking place and is greeted by Cawley. It is now when the almost famous plot twist occurs, and I cannot ethically reveal it. It's the film's greatest asset.Has there been a film as over-directed as this one recently? Scorsese does too good a job in placing the camera below his actors, dimming the lights, or showing a thunderstorm. His handiness is an attempt to counter the film's gratuitous length of 138 minutes. Additional footage of Daniels' personal life is referenced multiple times as well as many unnecessary visits to different places. The film could be cut by at least 40 minutes and lose little of its story. The movie while ""good"" under the categorical meaning of that word is a dreadful bore.While we have now sat through well-directed nothingness for about 110 minutes, the tone suddenly changes once the truth is revealed. And it is at this juncture that I went from passively enjoying the film (enough to recommend it) to disliking it. The film's climax does not fit logically within its structure and lacks the screen time to fit within the story. The ""whodunit"" comes about and then an existential quandary is presented to justify it. What a cheap shot. It's like leading someone (who is ugly) to think you (who are attractive) want to date them and then admitting it was a prank.The difficulty in predicting the twist shouldn't be praised. In the previous Dennis Lehane adaptation Gone Baby Gone it was unexpected yet plausible and thus satisfying. I think a twist is meaningless if its presence reverses the entire way an audience has been indoctrinated into a film. Scorsese's ability cannot cover for a weakness in the novel's storytelling and once you have experienced one type of Shutter Island you can't enjoy the other. The novel is probably the better version of this story.Not Recommended","

"barbara-czarniawska","25 February 2010","The middle of the movie is so pathetically bad, that one really wants to leave the movie theater (I did). I expected a Godzilla or a vampire to crawl out of a hole at any time (this is NOT a spoiler!) Luckily, it pivots and arrives at the end as a fairly interesting attempt. ""Fairly"": in general, the movie needed a cruel editor, who would have cut out the middle, or most of it. My suggestion would be to cut out all so-called Dachau scenes (so-called, because the picture of the gate shows Auschwitz). The Disneyization of the concentration camps continues, although one could have hoped that Scorsese would know better. He didn't, but perhaps this is common to all the US directors. They do not seem to believe it was real, and as a result treat it completely disrespectfully.Think about ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" done in the same manner: the protests would never cease. DiCaprio was good, no doubt about it: shouldn't he be given a better chance?","

"view_and_review","19 November 2021","""Shutter Island"" was intense. I knew it was a psychological thriller, so I was on my toes.""They're not going to fool me. I know how these movies work, it's all about misdirection.""Then they fooled me. Not in a ""Usual Suspects"" or ""Sixth Sense"" kind of way where my brain melted and leaked out of my ears in disbelief, but still in a way where I definitely had to tip my hat to the author.Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a U. S. Marshal sent to Shutter Island to find an escaped patient named Rachel Solando. He and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) began a routine enough investigation which slowly turned other than routine. He questioned Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), Dr. Naehring (Max Von Sydow), and others, yet he never felt like he was getting the answers he wanted. Then a doubt began to creep in: was he there by chance or was he there by design? And once you start playing that game in a movie that is all from a single person perspective there is no trusting anything or anyone.What was a rather normal police drama to start became a very intriguing psychological thriller. Yes, I wanted to know what was going on there, which was a testament to the production itself. With a lesser movie I wouldn't even care who did what, yet in ""Shutter Island"" they roped me in with the fine script, chilling musical score, and foreboding atmosphere. Scorsese was on top of his game with ""Shutter Island.""","

"dstan-71445","19 December 2022","A well written book with a non sensical but still a beautifully laid out twist. Not as polished as the author thinks though. There were a lot of ill conceived holes and story lines written for the sake of distraction just to be passed off as delusions when the twist is revealed. Shutter island was an eloquently written novel but had a lot of flaws and the movie sadly did not edit them out but went on galloping with them.Leonardo DiCaprio did try. He dripped sweat and blood to fit inside the skin of Teddy Daniels but reviewing his performance I say , he was not as grim , as stern , as rough , as depressed , as entertaining , as likable , as human as the character I read on the book.The set they created was impressive I admit. Re-created most of the scenes described on the book accurately and made them seem real. That I admire.But the main flaw of this adaptation is the fact that it was RUSHED.The story and the characters are not well established. It's too damn rushed. Everything feels hasty. The lines are coming out of nowhere. They do not pack as much punch as in the book cause Hollywood left out a lot of conversations that contribute a lot to the development of Teddy , the relationship he had with Chuck , his adoration for Dolores and his children ( especially Teddy , his son ) , his disturbing past as a soldier and the whole story in general.Chuck being revealed as Dr Sheehan for example was supposed to be a shocking and heart wrenching scene. But their partnership seems awkward here. Like they just met. They went through a lot in the book. Chuck was the only person Teddy had. He loved his charming mien. He believed he had his back. He was willing to risk his life to save him from that wretched light house. But all through out the movie and even at the end , it feels like those two are strangers. Not friends at all. It was the ultimate betrayal for Teddy but here it just felt like actors doing a stage play.Movie should have been longer, maybe a mini series. Because shortening such a complex story just made it confusing and killed the intriguing mystery and suspense the book is loved for.Anyways, lemme point out the plot holes I noticed and be on my way.The badge was supposed to be plastic but here it is a genuine, shiny aluminum. Who gave Teddy a real badge and isn't it illegal to walk around with a fake police ID ?Why did the nurse mention Dr Sheehan? It doesn't make sense to inform Teddy that a Dr Sheehan exists cause it will just raise questions and make the charade seem less believable to him.How didn't the patients he was interrogating recognize him ? It's not like you can coach a mental patient to play along on your masquerade. They were clearly loony and should have spilled the beans as George Noyce did.The patient writing ' Run ' was just shoved in to make us believe Ashecliffe is malign. It didn't contribute at all. It was just there to confuse readers and audiences that Teddy was not Laeddis and the yarn he was spinning was genuine.If Rachel wasn't real what the hell were the patients talking about ? All seem to have known a Rachel and obviously convincing a schizo to play in your facade is impossible. It doesn't make sense at all unless they're either orderlies or nurses acting. But clearly it wasn't as each had files that chronicled their violent pasts.If Rachel is not real , then won't that make Teddy the 66th and not the 67th patient ?Dr Sheehan risked his life and Teddy's by heading to ward C. He could have gotten injured. Teddy did. He got strangled. And he also hurt the patient at Sheehan's watch. They could have gotten really hurt cause it was psychos roaming the place.If Noyce was coached and they were listening to the entire conversation, what was the idea behind telling Teddy everything was a play? Won't that make Teddy suspicious? Won't that make him doubt the reality they built for him ?The car explosion in the book was done as a distraction for the guards keeping an eye on the ferry. Idk why he had to do it here. None of the guards around the light house run to the car to check it out. Teddy was hiding behind a tree till they showed up when he's supposed to be running.Allowing a violent and naive mental patient to wander around the island doing whatever the voices in his head tell him to do sounds dangerous and idiotic to me. He injured a doctor , a guard and a fellow patient on his way to the lighthouse. Was the life of Teddy worth endangering everyone on the island that came into contact with him ? That part about the premise does not seem feasible to me.You can't just tell us the real Solando Teddy interacted with is a hallucination. That's lazy as she was a clear proof his theories about Ashecliffe were correct. She not only talked with him but poked him and woke him up the next day. She felt real and was presented as real. A deceitful and lazy tactic was used to fool us into accepting Teddy was a real person.Some of the editing here and there was not good and book adaptations without narrations are usually confusing. It was hard to figure out what was going on in Teddy's head from just reading his facial expressions. A little assistance would have helped.Shutter island was watchable and has good performances esp from DiCaprio but was not as deep , perplexing and captivating as the book.","

"CaptRon-2","21 February 2010","It is hard to review this movie without giving away certain plot elements which would lead the reader to a final conclusion. Being sensitive to those that have not seen this movie, I will endeavor not to disclose such details.This movie was extraordinarily average in that it has been told many times and multiple levels, some often better than the sitting for this movie. While the cinematography was well done, it copied Deloris Clayborn in both format and style which surpassed this film. The cast is strong but it just can't overcome the uneven pacing of the film or the averageness of the script.As we prepared to see the movie, I informed my movie partner that the movie plot shouldn't involve certain twists else I would be very disappointed. Within the opening scene, the films ultimate conclusion was apparent so I was forced to suffer through the next two hours to see an ending I already knew. For some movies that isn't always a bad thing because getting there can be half the adventure (Lord of the Rings comes to mind) but in this case, between the poorly paced flashbacks and the current storyline, there was little to keep the audience excited.While the actors delivered strong performances, Dicaprio and Williams do not have on screen chemistry. Thinking of the awkward love scenes in Star Wars Eposides 2 & 3 with Anakin would give you some idea of how these two do not fit together.This is a Netflix movie and not something you want to pay $10 to sit through. It has been done before and a whole lot better than this movie.","

"jonnyfendi","17 April 2010","""Shutter Island"" seems to be an appropriate vessel for Leonardo DiCaprio to explore his acting skill. It's quite good, but yet it's not the finest, but I still can say thiz performance might be one of his best works so far. DiCaprio collaborates the fourth time with the Director Martin Scorsese, the last three are ""Gangs of New York"" (2002), ""The Aviator"" (2004) and ""The Departed"" (2006). Scorsese himself is a very good drama Director. His previous memorable classics are ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), ""Raging Bull"" (1980) and ""Goodfellas"" (1990). It's about US Marshall named Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) comes to an island to investigate a mysterious case. The island is actually a prison facility for mental illness. Thiz movie is supported by heavy caliber Cast members such as Ben Kingsley, Mark Rufallo, Mark Von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley and Michelle Williams. The script of thiz movie is very fine with several twist and turns. Scorsese with all his experiences successfully arranges every scene effectively. The exploration is classic, we even could see ""Hitchcock"" atmosphere here. The Score also helps a lot to build such an intensive tension. The great example when is on the opening scene, when Daniels and his partner just arrive on the island for the first time. When they observe the surrounding that is preserved with maximum securities, the gates is opened one by one. At a glance it's just an ordinary scene, but the Score multiplies it into ten times more thrill. The twist ending is meant to be shocking. But unfortunately (Spoiler Alert!), I already see the pattern where the story might goes even in the middle of the movie. When a conversation between Daniels and Rachel (Patricia Clarkson) that takes place in a cave, Daniels said angrily, ""I am an US Marshall. No one can stop me!"". That is the first time when I clearly know that he is actually one of the patients. In the end, if we have a movie that every scene is put in for a reason. That is the time when you got yourself an effective and flawless movie. Scorsese scores again! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com","

"bifties","18 March 2010","I always fear that preconceptions and/or high expectations can cause a film to do worse than it deserves. For instance, walk in to a movie that you know nothing about, and more often than not it will surprise you. On the other hand, walk into a film directed by Martin Scorsese, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, based on a novel written by Dennis Lehane (who wrote ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""Mystic River"") and a supporting cast that includes Mark Ruffalo, Max Von Sydow, Sir Ben Kingsley and Emily Mortimer, you are almost certain to be disappointed. However, this may have been true with other films but when it comes to a Scorsese/DiCaprio collaboration (for example Gangs of New York, The Departed and The Aviator)I expect a little bit more, and I expect the film to deliver something. This film sadly does not deliver, it does not excite and it does not deserve to be in IMDb's top 250 (which at the time of writing it does). I can only conclude that the masses have decided not to bet against a previously assumed sure thing, and instead vote along with everyone else rather than question the latest Scorsese/DiCaprio collaboration. The film opens on a boat, and within minutes we see DiCaprio and Ruffalo standing on the deck talking. It was from this point onwards that I was disappointed and began to expect very little from the rest of the film. Blue screen? Green screen? Whatever they use, they used it here and it looked horrible. And if nothing else, I have always found that of the Scorsese films I didn't necessarily enjoy in the past I would at least walk out at the end saying how beautiful and authentic everything looked. Well not here. Seriously disappointing. Don't waste ya time!","

There is no clever aspect, nothing of the sort that made Hitchcock so great.The actors do the best they can -- I guess -- with this film which has a feeling of decadence and doom about it. The ending is a blessed relief. I enjoyed the clothes, the props, the car that was blown up, so I cannot rate it zero. One out of ten is the best I can do. Give this bomb a miss.

"kevin_robbins","13 January 2022","Shutter Island (2010) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Netflix. The storyline follows an asylum in the 1950s that suddenly lost a patient. Two detectives are sent from the mainland onto the island to investigate the missing persons. They quickly discover a series of strange behaviors and practices by the staff that once they understand better may explain the missing person.This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas) and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (Django), Mark Ruffalo (Avengers), Ben Kingsley (Iron Man 3), Max von Sydow (Flash Gordon), Patricia Clarkson (The Green Mile), Jackie Earle Haley (Watchmen), Ted Levine (Silence of the Lambs) and John Carroll Lynch (Zodiac).This storyline is brilliantly written and contains fantastic backstories, character development, settings and twists and turns. The settings themselves where the story and subplots take place are excellent and the background music establishing the intensity of every scene perfectly. The attire, hairstyles and depiction of the era is well established. The acting across the board is out of this world and Scorsese pulled together an all star cast. The mannerisms of the characters throughout the movie is important to pull through the magnificent ending and every character is portrayed to perfection. The ending of this movie comes together so well and couldn't have been more clever.Overall this is another Scorsese masterpiece that's an easy 10/10 and an absolute must see.","

"writers_reign","5 February 2012","In scene III, Act II of Henry IV Part One, Hotspur, a fiery, plain-speaking and uncomplicated man tells his wife, Kate that 'this is no world to play with mammets and to tilt with lips; we must have bloody noses and cracked crowns'. It would take, I would argue, someone like Hotspur to sever this Gordian knot which is as complex as anything David Mamet ever wrote. Usually where labyrinthine plots are involved most, if not all inconsistencies are explained in the last reel but unless I missed something that is not the case here. This is what I saw. An opening scene in which a Federal marshall, awaiting a ferry to transport him to Shutter Island, meets for the first time, his assistant. Both men are in civilian clothes and carrying both i.d. and guns. Having reached the island, which houses an asylum for the criminally insane - they are going there specifically to investigate the 'escape' of a female patient - they show their i.d. at the gate of the prison and surrender their weapons. The best part of two hours later the psychiatrist in charge tells the Federal marshall that he is, in fact, a patient and has been for the past two years, further, his 'assistant' identifies himself as the psychiatrist in charge of the Federal marshall's case. If this is in fact the case, why allow an insane man to leave the prison in civilian clothes - all inmates wear white uniforms - and furnish him with (presumably) fake i.d. and a gun? If this is ever explained to my satisfaction I'll return and re-review it.","

"brandon_lee420","13 July 2010","While the film was in theatres, I took my chance to read the book that made this film come alive. The book was fantastic and puzzles and twists were very surprising. When the film reached my local video store, I took my chance to grab it off the shelf and view it. The film does a good job of having the same atmosphere and dialog as the book while also staying true to it, as well. The cast did an excellent job of portraying the characters in the book and their performances were over the top. If I hadn't read the book, I would've given this film a perfect ten but that could, sadly, not happen since I already knew what was going to happen and it made the film a bit more boring. The dialog in Shutter Island is mostly what you read in the book but the people who say those lines do a really good job. Two particular lines that were used in both the film and books were, ""Thorns as big as my d*ck."" and ""Pull yourself together, Teddy."" and I remember them a bit more than the others because one was funny and the other one was cool. So cool in fact is that I wake up every morning and splash water onto my face and stare at the mirror and exactly say that line. The acting was top notch in this motion picture with Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, and Jackie Earle Haley taking the top four spots. Leonardo DiCaprio, in my opinion, did a superb job of portraying Teddy Daniels and my vision of Teddy was what Leonardo gave us. He plays a U.S. marshal who is investigating the disappearance of one of the patients from the Ashcliff Hospital for the criminally insane. Along the way he discovers puzzles and finds out that everybody is keeping a secret from him. He really gave a convincing act. Ben Kingsley does a well done job of Dr. John Cawley, who is the somewhat mysterious, and his accent is really cool. Mark Ruffalo plays the partner of Teddy, Chuck Aule, as they are sent to the hospital where a mystery plagues the entire hospital. Ruffalo impressed me a lot in this film and he does a good job of knowing nothing when he really does. The best and by the far most impressive actor has to be Jackie Earle Haley for his wonderful role as George Noyce, a mental nutcase who speaks in riddles. Haley knows how to act in a good, realistic way and that is what separated him from everyone else and made him the king of Shutter Island. A lot of people are saying that this isn't one of the Scorsese's best works but I have to disagree and say that this his second best film after, of course, ""The Departed"". I suggest that you stop listening to these remarks and just be immersed into this complex yet fascinating mystery/thriller/horror. The wardrobe for this film matches the year it was set in and it does give the film a 1954 feeling. The makeup is quite good as well from the hairstyles to the facial makeup.In 1954, Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, from Seattle travel to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient there, Rachel Solando. She had been sectioned at the institution for dangerous criminals at Ashcliffe Hospital, because she drowned her three kids. Teddy is a veteran WWII soldier, traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Duchan concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that his investigation is obstructed by the management by the Federal facility. Teddy has severe migraines and when there is a storm; Teddy and Chuck find that they are stranded in the island. Teddy interviews the internees and follows a lead to the lighthouse, where he discloses the mystery about the Shutter Island.Roger Ebert wrote in his review, ""the movie is about: atmosphere, ominous portents, the erosion of Teddy's confidence and even his identity. It's all done with flawless directorial command. Scorsese has fear to evoke, and he does it with many notes."" and I have to agree with that. He awarded the film 3 and a half stars. People on IMDb who wrote negatively about the film mostly complained about the ending and how they would have liked it to go in another direction. Well, I have a message for them: LIVE WITH IT! The ending was as perfect as it gets but in the film you don't get as much shock form it like the shock you get by reading the book. If anyone is reading this review make sure that you don't read any reviews that contain spoilers because most of them ruin the surprise ending and with a delicate film like this it is easy to say, ""Sh*t! I wish I could go back in time!!AHH!"". The flashbacks that haunt Teddy are portrayed in a mean, nasty way from the war, his life, and his wife. This film should be recommended to people who love Scorsese's works because this is one of his masterpieces that you have to feast upon. I also strongly suggest is that, if you can, read the book before you watch the film because it will make you want to view the film more. I watched it so I could compare this with the book and I was very happy as a result. 8/10 - Shutter Island is a film that you can't miss out on and that is a rule!""Over and Out."" 13 July, 2010.","

"Zac_La_Porte","19 December 2021","Shutter Island is certainly worthwhile when you're truly able to concentrate closely on its very slow-moving but immensely complex twist. It's probably not the best movie we've received from such a talented director, Martin Scorsese, but his execution of Dennis Lehane's psychologically thrilling story is still brilliant.It feels quite rare when psychological films approach and are able to fully compel and thrill us with its moving concept and dark twists, but it's probably rarer when that film provides its obviously slow-burning story in a way that won't keep your attention the ENTIRE time. With a solid runtime of over 2 hours, Shutter Island delivers massive amounts of flawless components such as performances and decent execution. However, this is not a light-toned film where you can just completely switch off and still collect the overall effect that's the exact same as the impact caused to everyone who was properly concentrating.It's very solid, very twisted, very disturbing, and Martin Scorsese is able to significantly capture exactly what's required. DiCaprio is excellent in this movie, but ever other cast member that even briefly appears throughout the film does an exceptional job. Shutter Island's only weakness lands in between almost nearly every moment, which is slow and dragged out in a psychological tone. Kids should also keep away from this solid darkness.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","

"TamPalm","21 February 2010","I was ambivalent before going into this movie. I read some great reviews on IMDb and I love Leo Dicaprio as an actor so that made me excited to see it. However, I am not a big Scorce fan--I thought ""Departed"" was overrated--so that made me kind-of leery. Unfortunately, just like ""Departed,"" this movie was overly morbid and the r.o.i (return on investment) was insufficient.Like others have stated, you keep waiting on the big twist in this movie, but it never comes. I read that this movie is for ""smart"" people, but not really. It didn't require a lot of thinking at all. If you've ever seen one of the many movies about the criminally insane, then you've pretty much seen this movie already--only chances are this movie is not as good as the ones you saw.So I fell asleep...and when I woke up only to see that I really didn't miss much--this movie is sooo slow--I tried to make myself go back to sleep again. But to no avail. This movie is a sleeper in the literal sense. It, like ""Up in the Air,"" is over-hyped maybe based on its cast or something. But you will leave with a ""what did I just see?"" feeling and you'll wonder what more constructive activity you could have been doing for that couple of hours. A real blah of a movie experience. Lift me up (with all the hype) then leave me hanging...just hanging there in thin air waiting...waiting...roll credits. *sigh* My six rating is generous and given mostly because the acting is good. That's about all that's not blah (and even it couldn't save the film.)","

"moviemanMA","28 February 2010","Shutter Island is based on the book of the same name by Dennis Lehane, the man who penned Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone. Needless to say this film too takes place in Boston, Lehane's stomping grounds, but this time we go outside of the city limits and into Boston Harbor. Federal Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been sent to investigate the disappearance of a patient at a hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. He and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) must gather the facts, find some clues, and see what exactly happened to this missing patient.Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) runs the show on Shutter Island. He oversees all activities with the doctors, nurses, orderlies, and guards. It is his idea that the patients on the island are not prisoners but people who are in desperate need of help through more humane means. Teddy and Chuck soon find out that not all is as it seems on the island. It's as if everyone has a secret and is scared to tell.To make matters worse, Teddy suffers from nightmares and flashbacks about his wife (Michelle Williams) and her sudden death in an apartment fire. He tries to pull it together but the line between what is real and what is in his head slowly starts to blur, causing him to lose sight of what he is really on the island to do.With the help of a tight screenplay by Laeta Kalogridis (Night Watch, Alexander, Pathfinder) and spectacular cinematography by one of the best in the business, Robert Richardson (Platoon, JFK, Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2, The Aviator), Scorsese is able to deliver a solid, psychological thriller. Starting with the script, I was happy that it wasn't just an exercise in exploiting the Boston accent, like too many movies and TV shows have done of late. It also does a nice job of keeping us involved with the story. Especially with thrillers, it is very easy to lose your audience if you present an idea or a plot point that is too over their head. Here we slowly learn more and more about the characters until finally at the end WHAM! The big turnaround and a very nice payoff. Credit is due to both Kalogridis and for Lehane's magnificent story.Richardson, who is nominated this year for Inglourious Basterds, makes it clear that there isn't going to be a lot of sunshine both in the story and on the film. The very first frame we see a boat emerge from the fog as it rolls towards Shutter Island. Bringing with it Teddy, Chuck, and one heck of a storm. Scorsese and Richardson were obviously going for a stylized effect, carefully selecting the appropriate lighting for each scene, a crucial element to the film's success. Each shot is clear, crisp, and emphasizes just the right colors or lack of color.The performances were right on the money. DiCaprio has developed quite an on screen presence. When he is in the shot we focus right on him. He gives 110% for every scene. Seeing as his character has a lot of emotional baggage, he plays it very paranoid and jumpy, unlike his partner Chuck who is more relaxed and level. DiCaprio clashes with the authorities on the island so well like Kingsley, Max von Sydow, and John Carrol Lynch. Also a great cameo performance by Jackie Earle Haley as one of the patients. His career is certainly looking brighter with each performance.There are a few downers in the film. I thought the middle of the film was a little slow sometimes and lacked the pace and intensity of the first and last acts. The flashbacks for the most part were a little too artsy, almost to the point where it was literally pouring down on us. They felt a little out of place considering the rest of the film, but it felt okay in flashback/dream form. They were very well shot and had a particular look that I enjoy (artsy).What I love about Scorsese, like other great filmmakers, is that regardless the theme, setting, or genre, he manages to add his own personal touch. Though there is certainly a touch of Hitchcock, the angles, composition, and overall look of the film is Scorsese. He's a incredible filmmaker who continues to make hit after hit after hit.","

"Red_Identity","20 February 2010","Martin Scorsese. What Can I say about him. He has created so many great films, including Raging Bull, and the recent The Departed. Here, he covers some new territory, and like I wanted, it is not a film to really wrap your minds around it. The film plays out in ways that are what you would expect from a regular thriller, yet at the same time, you cannot help but wonder what it will all come to be. What can be said is that the performances are outstanding. Leonardo Dicaprio gives another powerhouse of a performance, showing that when he is committed he gives it his all. With performances from The Departed, Revolutionary Road, and now Shutter Island, he has proved he is one of the best actors working today. Jackie Earle Haley is really great in a small scene he is in, and Michelle Williams really affecting in her role. The whole film cannot be described, but experienced. Throughout the film, I was thinking it has some obvious flaws, and that while I really liked it, I could not love it... and then we get to the twist.When the twist came, about who Teddy Daniels really was, I was overwhelmed by it. I thought the film should have been given a much better twist. While I can admit in the novel it must have felt shocking, while I watched this twist unfold I must say I was very unpleasantly surprised. Not because it was executed badly, since a lot of the film's earlier mysteries made sense now, but because these sort of twists have been done to death that I would think anyone would stay away from it. But then as the scene with Teddy and Dolores' past tragedy unfolded, I began to have a sense of excitement because, I thought, could it be that the film would do a backflip and this not be the twist at all? Could it be that the final twist would actually be that this given twist was simply not real, and that the island's conspiracy be true? While the scene when Teddy is confessing who he really is and that he had murdered his wife was happening, I was lost. I did not know if this was real or if the real twist would happen. I was really hoping another twist and the real ending happen, because this would be a very tired and overwhelming ending. Then, when the film switched to black, I was like WOW. No answers given. The film played with me, made me first angry, then secretly happy and hoping for the real thing, and then leaves me no answers and to finally guess whether the truth is that Shuuter Island is a conspiracy or if Teddy really is insane. I figured it out! It was all about the execution of it all, and looking back on it now, whichever was the real truth did not matter, because Scorsese had messed with my mind. By this time, I simply fell in love with the film, flaws and all. It did it for me, and looking back on the film, I can say that it may join the ranks of The Departed, and even films like Mulholland Dr. or other lynch films in the future, with rewatches. This is film-making at it's most brilliant, but do not be fooled. While watching the film, you may not think this at all. Trust me.","

"anaconda-40658","11 May 2015","Shutter Island (2010): Dir: Martin Scorsese / Cast: Leonardo DiCapro, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Max von Sydow: Psychological thriller about isolation. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a federal Marshall who arrives by fairy with his partner to Shutter Island where he is to investigate the disappearance of a dangerous inmate. Things are not as they seem as DiCaprio questions the methods of the institution as well as confront his own visions. Director Martin Scorsese's fourth collaboration with DiCaprio. Previously they were responsible for Gangs of New York, The Aviator, and The Departed. It is no surprise that Shutter Island carries on the trend. Great performance by DiCaprio who grows haunted and suspicious with every clue he discovers. Mark Ruffalo plays his partner who goes for reason when DiCaprio becomes frustrated and heated. Ben Kingsley steals scenes as the head doctor at the institution. DiCaprio doesn't trust the doctor due to lack of cooperation nor is the staff any help. Michelle Williams is seen in flashbacks as DiCaprio's deceased wife. We learn through DiCaprio that she died by an intentional fire where the guilty wasn't found. Her flashback scenes are bright with life while the rest of the film deals with dark shadows and lighting that enhance the corridors of the prison. Max von Sydow is featured briefly as a mysterious doctor who dominates his scenes. With the exception of its ending, this film presents the eerie side of the human animal as well as present the reality of gloom within a prison. It is enough to make you shutter. Score: 9 / 10","

(BTW my wife agrees & dislikes it even more than I do, if that's possible). For one this the plot is so preposterous & predictable, I could have guessed the ""twist"" when I was 10 years old. Heck I could have written it when I was 10. Then, what is it with Dicaprio? Why is he wearing that weird 1930s prison gang hair in a movie that takes place in the 1950s? I'm surprised the guy's gotten any work after the Gatsby joke of a film. And Revenant? Come on, I'll take Richard Harris as Hugh Glass any day.","

"FlashCallahan","20 March 2010","It's 1954, and up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital.He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister.Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open.This has to be the most non-Scorcese Scorcese movie ever made, and it shows that he can master any genre he tackles. From the upstart, the film is startlingly grim and has a cold, dirty feel to it, and you immediately know from the mood the film exudes, something isn't right.Dicaprio proves again he is a magnificent actor, moving further away from his teen heart-throb status he once had, to becoming a convincing leading man. Gone is the boyish charm he had in recent movies.The sets of the movie are fantastical and do sometimes hint to the shining in places, and the subliminal hallucinations Teddy has, are as unnerving as any conventional horror. The trailer did look like this was going to be some sort of psychological horror, but this could not be further from the truth.This is a film about wanting to forget past traumas, and putting on a facade when you cannot face reality, and this is intricate to the films plot.As the film progresses, you get a claustrophobic feel, and begin to empathise with Teddys helplessness, as he and his world begin to spiral out of control.By the end, you realise that Teddy takes the ultimate sacrifice by wanting to forget something that affected his life so much.All of the cast are splendid, and although some of the editing is dire, this is still a must see.","

"E-un","27 June 2010","I don't have much to say about this movie at all. I felt that the storytelling was amateurish at best. The scenes were hacked together in such a poor fashion, and the clues to the ending were so blatant. I worked out the premise of the movie about 8-15 minutes in. Sure, I wasn't absolutely certain at that point, but once I reached my conclusion the 'clues' came thicker, faster, and so blatant they were right in my face. After 30 minutes I had no further doubts that I'd nailed it. It's not so much that I'm so awesome at guessing movie plots, but more about how badly put together this story happens to be.Without giving too much away, the initial scene on the boat tipped me off right away that something was off. The scene were they arrive at the island contained some more heavy-handed clues. The dead giveaway though, was the way that later scenes did not fit together coherently. The second or third dream sequence lasted too long for a conventional depiction of a dream, and I felt that we were supposed to lose track of what was real and what was fantasy/dreaming.Overall, I was very disappointed following some rave reviews. This movie has been made before, and it's been made much better.","

"wolverinesforever","16 May 2010","There seems to be a divide among critics and audiences on the twist and ending to ""Shutter Island,"" with some calling it brilliant, and others calling it cheap. I found the ending to be effective, and here's why.I think it helps cement the picture as a statement on what a person will do to block out (or warp) a bad memory. Keep in mind that Andrew Laeddis (I will refer to Leo's character by his real name here) did not want to be associated with killing anymore after the incident in Dachau. Because he was so traumatized by that, and by the actions of his wife, he tries to fulfill his commitment by putting the murder on someone else. The reason he goes insane is because his mind will do anything to deny the truth, even if it means falling into delusional traps. The last scene may also show how far he is willing to go to wash out the memory of him murdering his wife. Has he really regressed, or is he just pretending so the memory can be gutted out?Laeddis wants to remain a good person. Yet not only does his insanity block him from the dark truth, but it also makes the other people on Shutter Island not trust him or take him seriously (Laeddis once remarks that once you're declared insane, anything you say or do is perceived with a wary mind). He's a war veteran, he is a former U.S. Marshall, and he's living in the era of Cold War paranoia. How far will he go to avoid, as he puts it, to ""live a monster""?Yes, ""Shutter Island"" plays numerous mind games and misdirects us. But not only do I feel this is understandable (since the protagonist is an unreliable narrator), but I feel it all plays into the film's themes of denial and sanity (or lack, thereof).I give it an 8.5/10, and I will stand by my belief that this is another solid film from Martin Scorsese.","

"Jackpollins","30 March 2010","Shutter Island is a Gothic thriller about Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), two police officers investigating a disappearance at an insane asylum run by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). The film's first 15 minutes are fantastic, setting the mood just right, but it gets too weird from then on. This is directed by Martin Scorsese, a usually wonderful director. Scorsese's best films investigate the main character and peeling back his or hers layers. That's just where the problem starts with Shutter Island. The film has too much going on and never gets to fully peel back the layers of any of the characters. There are Teddy having nightmares about the war & his wife, the disappearance plot, and a bunch of twists & turns. It plays mind games with its audiences for 2 hours before making sense with its final 20 minute twist. That brings me to my next point, the film is too long. It's 2 hours & 20 minutes, which is far too long for such a weird & uneven film. I've always thought Mark Ruffalo was underrated & a good actor, but he's given nothing to do with his character. His character is extremely dull. Scorsese's use of sound is also torturing. Overall, Shutter Island spends too much time stalling and ends up being unsatisfactory in the end. I can't recommend it to anyone, because life is too short to spend 2 hours & 20 minutes watching this.","

"socklessmenace","23 February 2010","I am an extreme movie goer. So obviously I follow the works of the great Martin Scorsese. I heard this movie was also a thinker and much like an old style Hitchcock film. Considering Hitchcock is my favourite director and is a master at his work and a genius at the art of psychological horror...I was overwhelmed with excitement for this movie.In all I say the plot of this movie was...okay. Don't get me wrong, it's very smart and completely original and as far as I know not done before. However, if you are as much a movie buff as myself this twist ending is a give away obvious one right off the bat. this is why it lost 3 stars for me. However, it touches on many emotions and other aspects besides the main plot of the film and runs deeper then its first visible roots. A truly complex film.Now on too why I gave it the seven stars. Martin Scorsese, Martin Scorsese, Martin Scorsese. If for no other reason, see this film for its amazing directing. Shutter Island truly brings back the psychological thriller and is both beautifully and horrifyingly directed. This right here is why Scorsese is known for being a true dominator of his medium.And so for Performance of the movie by both the actors and director I give this movie a probable 9.5 but for plot and story I give it a probable 6. I recommend it, but for those real film buffs out there who know the layout of how movies work and are good at guessing the twist endings...don't get your hopes up. However 45% of the people I went with said they didn't understand it so I guess that can be taken into account as well.","

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","31 March 2022","Over time, it becomes difficult to avoid spoilers for twist endings in movies. While it took me over a decade to watch Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island (2010), I had already heard about the twist a few times and had prepared myself for it. Of course, only the best films like Shutter Island can have this twist spoiled and still provide enough subterfuge to hide this revelation for most of its runtime. I knew it was coming, and it still blindsided me.Of course, knowing the twist of Shutter Island made me watch it with a modicum of awareness as I tried to spot the cracks in the narrative that would hint at this revelation. Part of how this film expertly hides this twist is by following Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and showing the audience what he thinks is happening. It's not until near the end of the film that we get a view of the reality of the situation from another character's perspective, and by then the whole facade has come apart for Teddy. I had to keep guessing what was real and what wasn't for much of the movie, which just shows how well executed it is.Of course, also knowing the twist of the movie made me question a few of the early portions of the film, as they didn't seem to make sense considering the whole narrative. The ending addressed most of the inconsistencies, but there were still a few moments that made me think, ""Huh?"" It's clear Inception (2010) overshadowed Shutter Island, but it still deserves a watch for being another well-directed and acted psychological thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio that came out in 2010.A psychological treat that hides its twist even if you know about it, I give Shutter Island 4.0 stars out of 5.","

"LaowaiGuy","7 April 2010","Shutter Island is one of those thrillers that can really only go one of two ways. The first option is the ""he/she's gone crazy option"". The main character is dreaming, on drugs, insane or dead and no one can seem to help him or her recover from their unfortunate condition. A Beautiful Mind or The Sixth Sense are prime examples of these types of films.The other option is the massive conspiracy option where the character is being heartlessly manipulated by numerous people in some sort of cruel diversion required for him to truly appreciate his charmed existence. Movies like The Game or The Forgotten played that angle to ridiculous extremes. Shutter Island tries to have the best of both options and still manage to come off as a credible movie.Don't get me wrong. It's an entertaining movie with a great performance from one of the best directors and best actors of this generation. Leonardo and Martin can help create an engaging movie, however it doesn't change the fact that the main characters in this movie have to jump through incredible holes in the plot to get to the truth.The audience has believe that a in facility full of nurses, doctors and policemen that all these ""protect and serve"" types are just going to let a delusional person run around the compound and try to figure out his true existence. We have to suspend all belief in reality in order to serve the needs of one troubled character. No one will try and help him? No one will try to stop a possible criminal from roaming around the complex questioning everyone he sees. This seems a bit much to ask of people who work at this facility, even trained professionals.Would they really risk endangering all the people who live near or on this facility to be exposed to a possibly dangerous or deranged individual? It doesn't seem very likely especially in an era where anyone who acted different than the mainstream population: Communists, educated African-Americans, gays and Rock 'n' Roll stars were all cause for alarm in 1950s American society.I the movie's acting, cinematography and direction were top-notch (except for forgettable Mark Ruffalo as Leonardo's buddy). It was just to hard to ignore the gaping holes in the plot.","

"alexx668","9 March 2010","For American standards, this is a relatively difficult film, with an elliptical narrative, ""dead"" spaces, ornate direction, slow pacing, and so forth. It is also very uneven, tense and claustrophobic on one hand, but with lots of ups and downs on the other. At it's best, it is very intense, at it's worst, it is downright flat and predictable, and hardly helped by the anemic meaning.First things first. As a director, Scorsese is probably at his finest here, which is good. Compared to, say, Coppola, he is still evolving, which is the sign of a healthy artist. He is still not an auteur, but this is overall his best direction.Now, the little trick of having two realities warping around each other is borrowed by David Lynch, and is hardly causing any sort of sensation anymore. The ending with the lobotomy is also borrowed from Gilliam's ""Brazil"", as is the whole message in general, that in turn is borrowed from Orwell's ""1984"". The message here is that of a society evolving from the ghosts of a brutal World War II, that is seemingly democratic, but in reality authoritarian and artificial. The subtle references about McCarthyism are nice, but actually the whole message is rather vague, and in the end serves as a pretense for a claustrophobic existential thriller.","

It's made very clear from the off set that they may do their job, but they are not in charge and must co-operate with the warden and the guards on the island. As slow progress is made, Daniels and Aule start to conjure up wild conspiracy theories to what is going on on the island and their real reason for being sent there. Things aren't helped when the chief doctors on the island Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max von Sydow) aren't being very forthcoming, and the pair are left further to their own devices. But as Daniels suffers flashbacks to his time in the war liberating a Nazi concentration camp and his perception of reality becomes blurred, everything starts to become less clear and everything looks set to become not how it seems.Martin Scorsese has returned with a film that is an unusual branch out from his usual gangster movie schtick, and is a fresh approach for him to experiment with. It's also another adaptation of a novel by Dennis Lahane, after the superb Gone Baby Gone and the very watchable Mystic River. But while Shutter Island is a very well made and tense film, somehow for me it just didn't match up to the quality of those last two films.This plays as a very long and drawn out, what typically gets called nowadays a 'mind f*ck' film, showing a lead character becoming increasingly claustrophobic and isolated, and being pushed to question his own sanity in the light of increasing evidence everything is not how he sees it. It's not afraid to push boundaries, showing the blood splattered bodies of murdered children, for instance, even harder to fathom for a 15 certificate film. Typical of Lahane's work, it's unflinching and goes straight for the jugular, unafraid to delve into the darker side of human nature and playing for a more mature audience. And there is a complex and carefully structured mystery to fathom through out that you have to pay attention to. Yet somehow it just feels really hard to get in to, and all feels a little too much to take in at once. It feels like one of Lahane's more ambitious works and it works having an expert like Scorsese on hand to oversee things, but somehow their respective styles clash, the tone feeling less riveting and more plodding. There is a tense and decent score, which drives a lot of it and gives certain scenes a more dynamic edge, but it all just fails to come together as a whole.Performances wise, Di Caprio is suitably intense and unrestrained in the lead role, as a man being pushed over the edge, with sturdy support from Ruffalo. Meanwhile, Kingsley and von Sydow are a well cast double act as the educated but dodgy main doctors, and there's a lively supporting cast in the shape of Jackie Earle Haley, Elias Koteas and Patricia Clarkson.Shutter Island has worked with some and been a more average affair with others. Like a lot of films nowadays, it may be a 'need to see it twice' affair, but personally Scorsese's last film The Departed really showed his flair a lot more successfully to a 21st century audience. ***",NA
"markovd111","28 December 2019","While everyone in the reviews section is busy talking how this movie has an amazing plot twist, I would like to stress out something else. While all of that is true, you should also note that the location on which this movie takes place could be seen like a state of mind. Whole movie is actually one psychological journey, full of suspense, discovery, denial and constant dance of truth and lie. It has an amazing atmosphere, acting and in some scenes border on pure horror with clever use of sound and visuals. There is also a sense of freedom in interpretation of the movie, and when the movie makes me think about it for a long time after watching it, it really mean's it something extraordinary. I give it 10/10 and I urge you to watch it! It's good! :)",NA
"jessicareid","31 July 2013","I had been wanting to watch this film for a while and when I finally got round to doing so it did not disappoint. Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect in the role of the marshal Teddy Daniels and he really brought the whole film to life with his performance. Mark Ruffalo was also memorable for his portrayal of the supporting character and their relationship was a crucial part of the story so it was important that they both played their parts convincingly. What I loved about this film was the whole psychological aspect of it which makes it extremely gripping. It's the type of film which constantly makes you wonder who is telling the truth and it pushes the viewers to try and figure out what is really going on. As the film progresses and reaches the final stage there are more and more twists revealed. Even after having seen the big revelation at the end of the film I still know I could watch this film again in the future as it would be interesting to view taking into account the truth at the end. Even though this film is over 2 hours long it certainly didn't feel like it and the thrilling scenes and build up of suspension throughout made it go so quickly. This film is definitely worth a watch and some people may have mistaken it for a horror from some parts of the trailer but it was simply a good psychological thriller.",NA
"CinemaClown","17 January 2020","Shutter Island happens to be the first Martin Scorsese film that I actually loved. Considered by many to be a departure from his usual forte, this neo-noir psychological thriller isn't rated highly by his most devoted followers but I'd argue that it is right up there with his finest directorial efforts.An ingeniously structured, intelligently layered & impressively acted genre delight that's dark, delirious & discombobulating, Shutter Island finds Scorsese indulging in unapologetic genre thrills, and also presents Leonardo DiCaprio in outstanding form as he adds yet another spectacular performance to his résumé.Pervaded with an air of mystery & sense of foreboding, the film effectively builds on its interesting premise, and only gets more gripping, thrilling & suspenseful as plot progresses. Scorsese keeps the plot faithful to its source material while eerie camerawork, tight editing & menacing music keeps the tense aura alive n kicking.Leading from the front is DiCaprio whose riveting input & magnetic presence only amps our interest & investment in his character's journey. And he's well supported by Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow & Michelle Williams who all chip in with sturdy performances of their own. In short, the entire ensemble delivers and leave nothing to complain about.Overall, Shutter Island is a smartly directed, cleverly scripted & strongly acted mystery thriller that effortlessly sustains its chilling ambience from start to finish and is highly reminiscent of Hitchcock's thrillers. One of the best films of its year that keeps the viewers guessing at all times and makes fab use of genre elements to keep things taut & exciting, the 4th collaboration between Scorsese & DiCaprio is another quality work.",NA
"tpaladino","26 March 2010","I had heard that this movie was a disappointment... I even had the ending ruined for me about a month before it came out. Both of those things kept me from seeing it until I could catch it on PPV.I have to say that not only was this film not a disappointment in any way, but the fact that I 'knew' what the ending was didn't detract from the experience at all. Scorcese was really masterful at weaving a story that is absolutely engrossing and thrilling without resorting to creepy effects or obvious scare tactics (which would have been the cheap and easy way to tell this story). It was wonderful and refreshing, to say the least, to watch a genuinely interesting thriller that takes place at a secluded mental institution and not have to endure shock scenes of ghoulish creatures or other overused devices like that. I've read some of the bad reviews and critiques, and I honestly have to say that I don't understand what they're on about at all. Its a great movie.",NA
"eahoulie","14 March 2010","I will admit, for the first hour I was riveted. Not because I didn't know what was going on, sorry this movie is predictable. No, I was riveted by the atmosphere of this darkened, storm-secluded island, cold and windy and ripe for something suspicious (similar to the Ring's Moesko Island) and Leonardo Dicapro working his crafted Boston accent. Little quirky behaviors and denial to cooperate do well to induce paranoia. Unfortunately Ben Kingsley has been in so much cheese these days that his appearance gave me a red flag instantly and it's all down-hill shortly thereafter. Sub-plots that are meant to distract you from the truth are poorly written and acted to the point where you really don't believe them anyway. This movie has too much going on and goes on for so long that by the time you're done putting up with it all ""the truth"" just leaves you feeling cheated. And trust me, we've seen this kind of ""truth"" in other movies before. The men on either side of me in the theater fell asleep and I felt genuinely guilty for dragging my boyfriend to see it. Don't waste your money.",NA
"Calicodreamin","4 February 2021","A positively captivating movie, I couldn't look away... mostly for fear of missing some detail needed to piece it all together... but still. Wonderful acting and a well developed storyline. The plot slowly leads you to the ""twist"" but you still don't believe it immediately. Well made in all regards.",NA
"jack_o_hasanov_imdb","3 August 2021","I think any aspect of the movie is too high and good to be controversial. It's all messing you up. Come on , you say. It's one of those rare films that doesn't have anything I can criticize. Acting and script are top notch. The result is marvelous.10 / 10.",NA
"MannyCastro","16 February 2010","A hurricane is approaching and patient Rachel Solando escapes from an insane asylum that's located in an island. She didn't try to swim away because the current would have killed her and washed her ashore. So, where is she? That's what U.S. Marshalls Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are trying to find out.Throughout their investigation they begin to wonder if Solando really did escape. Does a Rachel Solando even exist? Perhaps it's a trap. Someone wants them on that island and isn't going to let them escape. And with the hurricane nearby they couldn't even if they wanted to.That's the mystery in director Martin Scorsese's first film since 2006's The Departed, the movie for which he finally won an Academy Award. Like The Departed and even his 1991 film, Cape Fear, it's a thriller that'll have audiences on the edge of their seat. However, it is the weakest of the three. If this movie has one flaw (and it's only ONE flaw) it's that it relies too much on the mystery. Once you know the ending there's no reason to re-watch the film. It's two hours and twenty minutes of DiCaprio running around a mental institute. Aside from two or three humorous scenes nothing distracts the plot. It's on autopilot. So, it's a really good movie but a B-plot away from being great.",NA
"ncoviell","19 February 2010","Shutter Island: 9.1/10 - As should be obvious by now, Martin Scorsese is all about creativity; painting a picture through film and completely absorbing the viewer in the world of the movie. His undeniable ingenuity of the process of film-making and truly creating a work of art makes Shutter Island that much more impressive. Scorsese does what he does best, creating a vivid and surreal world and sets one underlying mood that is present constantly throughout the movie; however, he didn't stray far from the story that Dennis Lehane created. In fact, he captured every element piece by piece, presented the atmosphere with delicacy so as to bring the island, the characters and the story to life.The narrative time-line of Shutter Island isn't that of your normal film. Some scene cuts seem awkward and make the viewer feel as though they may have missed something. However, Scorsese does a beautiful job of displaying this type of feeling. While reading Lehane's book, one cannot help but feel like they are missing something as they go page to page; that is not by accident. Lehane structured his book to give off a level of uncertainty, to give off a feeling of something missing just like how Teddy Daniels seems to always be missing something. Through Lehane's writing and Scorsese's directing the audience is brought into Daniels' world; full of fill-in-the-blanks and confusion.However, Scorsese didn't stop at simply confusing the audience and pulling them into the mystery; we also brought Daniels' innermost struggles and tortures to life. The nightmare sequences are by far the highlight of Shutter Island, at least from a filmmaker's perspective. In these shots the viewer is introduced to haunting images such as Daniels' memories from war and mesmerizing sequences between Daniels and his dead wife. The connection between all of it, much like the film, is a bit hazy, but for specific reasons: just as Daniels struggles to put everything together, so does the audience. Likewise, Scorsese uses a great deal of foreshadowing, especially earlier on in the film that might not be so easy to pick up on, thus adding to the puzzle.Outside of the techniques and elements used to successfully capture the atmosphere, tone, and mood of the setting, the cast does some of the best work thus far in 2010. Lead by an almost superhuman performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, which may very be his best work to date; each actor portrays their character exactly as described and made out to be in the novel. Aside from DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley), Michelle Williams (Dolores) and Jackie Earle Haley (George Noyce) are especially effective in their roles as is Mark Ruffalo (Chuck Aule) to a lesser extent.Though it may not seem so, Shutter Island is the best movie to have been released in 2010 so far. Because although its structure and design may seem nothing more than a nightmare to some viewers, even nightmares contain a touch of beauty and a great deal of art if you can dig deep enough.",NA
"auuwws","9 July 2021","Another masterpiece by Martin Scorsese, the movie started slowly but the events accelerated excellently, the acting was good, especially from Leonardo DiCaprio who gave a great performance, the end of the movie was not impressive, I felt it was an ordinary event, contrary to what people said about the end, the music in The movie was good, but the repetition of a particular clip was very annoying, I recommend watching it and rating the movie at 8.5.",NA
"akg1249","17 June 2019","At the end of this movie, there are going to be only two kinds of audience: one, which will feel cheated because it watched in incredulity as one of the characters in the film shamelessly reveals the mystery flat out within the first 10 minutes, as if the director, sick with fear that the audience would feel betrayed, couldn't help himself; the second kind which would not notice the above and go on to watch the entire flick trying to assemble and reassemble the puzzle pieces, only to let out a groan in self-disgust for not having paid enough attention in the beginning.Whether you like this movie or not will depend on which of the above two categories you fall in. I watched this movie with my nephew. As the suspense was revealed, we both looked at each other and uttered almost together, ""What the hell...!?"" Movie itself is not so bad and has some decent performances and atmosphere, but it will all be meaningless if you are the first kind of audience.",NA
