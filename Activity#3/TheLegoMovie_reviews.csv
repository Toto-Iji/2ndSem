"bkrauser-81-311064","12 February 2014","Like many of you, the first time I saw the trailer for The Lego Movie (2014) I thought to myself, ""Are you kidding me?!"" Yet another movie based on a franchise of toys aimed towards families willing to cough up the cash just to shut their kids up. Can't we for once make movies for kids that don't dull the senses? Have we truly come to the point where there are no original thoughts? Yet after seeing not just families but college kids' line up to see sold out viewings I became interested. In addition, The Lego Movie managed to muster a staggering 93% on rottentomatoes.com, an unheard of fresh score in the February film graveyard. In short; curiosity got the best of me.Boy was I wrong about this film. I honestly couldn't have been more wrong about a film in my life. The Lego Movie is not only the must see film of the late winter season, I'm going to go ahead and call it now; it's the best family-oriented film for all ages of 2014. Okay maybe not but at the very least it's a very high bar to set.The story busts out of the gate from the get-go; Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) a wizard and ""master builder"", while protecting a mystery weapon is blinded by Lord Business (Will Ferrell), obviously our caped and big booted villain. Before Vitruvius is kicked into the abyss by Business and his robotic minions, he foretells of a hero, the ""special"" who will put an end to his dastardly plans, whatever they might be. The next morning Emmet a seemingly ordinary Lego construction worker goes about his normal day. He comes across a woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) searching for ""the piece of resistance"" which he unwittingly finds and becomes beholden to. Now it's up to Emmet and some newfound friends to fulfill the prophecy.It all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. Yet within The Lego Movie's brick-blocked world, everything including the story feels incredibly new and original. Children, especially the young will enjoy the fast action, laugh-a-minute jokes, sly slapstick and goofy characters. Obvious kid favorites will include perma-smiled Unikitty (Alison Brie) and zany 80's throwback astronaut Benny (Charlie Day) whose ability to create spaceships is frustratingly overlooked. Plus there's Batman (Will Arnett)Batman! The older crowd however will be astounded not only with the seamless CGI effects but with the subversive element throughout the film. Yes a goofy, kiddy film of such unrestrained chirpiness can be positively incendiary, at least in this case. Throughout the film there are Orwellian elements tucked underneath crafty pop-culture references ranging from Star Wars (1977) to Harry Potter. There are mischievous pokes at what Henry David Thoreau referred to as ""(leading) lives of quite desperation."" Finally there's cheeky satire aimed at the Danish toy brand itself. Much of the conflict revolves around ""master builders"" who build whatever they want out of the parts they find versus Lord Business who wants everything built ""according to the directions."" This particular theme struck the kid inside me as I was very fond of Legos. Younglings may not realize that back in the day, pre-designed Lego play sets took a back seat to the now impossible to find Lego Creative Bucket sets. To the uninitiated that particular red bucket set was an amalgam of potential foot sores but to this writer, those 200+ pieces were a gateway to an unlimited creative space.The Lego Movie accurately and effectively recreates that creative space through accessible movie magic. It exhibits a fun hero story that may not be treading new narrative ground but nonetheless feels fresh and new. Finally the themes and occasionally biting humor makes The Lego Movie a kid's film that isn't just for kids but the child in all of us. This February do yourself a favor and treat yourself to an adventure story unlike any other. Then go home and order some Legos online! I know I am.","

"BrentHankins","7 February 2014","Hollywood has a long history of taking beloved relics from our  childhood and adapting them into big-screen entertainment, with the  unfortunate truth being that the final product often bears little  resemblance to the source material that our younger counterparts loved  so much. Typically we're left with something that feels like a cheap,  hollow cash-in (The Smurfs, Garfield, Alvin and the Chipmunks), or a  bloated, special effects-laden monstrosity full of explosions and poor  acting (Battleship, Transformers, G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra).  So it was with much trepidation that I sat down to watch The Lego  Movie, steeling myself for an experience that would be little more than  a two- hour commercial designed to drive traffic into the nearest toy  store, coaxing money out of the wallets of parents and into the pockets  of the Danish toy company. Instead, I was treated with one of the most  original, creative and entertaining films I've seen in years, which has  quickly cemented itself as the first must-see movie of 2014.  Emmett (Chris Pratt) is a construction worker, obediently carrying out  his daily duties in accordance with the instruction manual provided to  all Lego citizens by President (Lord) Business (Will Ferrell), an  obsessive compulsive, maniacal CEO bent on world domination. Think Lex  Luthor, but as a complete control freak with less intelligence and more  mustache-twirling insanity.  A chance encounter with the beautiful WyldStyle (Elizabeth Banks) leads  Emmett to the mythical Piece of Resistance, an ancient relic spoken of  only in prophecy that can be used to save the Lego citizens from their  impending doom. Wyldstyle quickly whisks Emmett away and brings him  before the Master Builders, which include the sagelike Vitruvius  (Morgan Freeman), the manic 1980s astronaut Benny (Charlie Day), and  WyldStyle's boyfriend, Batman (Will Arnett, in perhaps the film's most  hilarious vocal performance). Together, the Master Builders formulate a  plan to defeat Lord Business by infiltrating his massive high-rise  fortress, using the Piece of Resistance to defeat him once and for all   provided they can escape the clutches of the terrifying Good Cop/Bad  Cop (Liam Neeson), Lord Business' most loyal henchman.  From the opening moments of the film, The Lego Movie fires an endless  array of jokes at its audience from seemingly every angle. Writers Phil  Lord and Christopher Miller (who also directed the film) have an expert  grasp of the absurd, and they use it to great effect, ensuring that  every scene is stuffed to the gills with laughs. Many of the film's  best moments are derived from the fact that the characters, vehicles,  and environments are created from Lego pieces: one of the rules  established by the filmmakers was that everything appearing on screen  must be possible to construct in the real world.  There's an especially clever twist that occurs during the third act  that, if attempted by less talented filmmakers, could've easily  derailed the entire experience, but Lord and Miller's pitch-perfect  execution makes it work. With lightning-fast wit, a surprising amount  of action, and perhaps a bit of attention deficit disorder, The Lego  Movie is consistently entertaining from start to finish. It's a  brilliant mix of humor, heart, and creativity, and provides a great  foundation to build on.  Sorry, I couldn't resist at least one Lego-related pun. But seriously,  The Lego Movie is fantastic.  -- Brent Hankins","

"Platypuschow","20 January 2018","I went into The Lego Movie expecting drivel, I thought it'd be alike the DC ones but without the DC element to appease me. Thankfully I was wrong, way wrong.This HUGELY acclaimed multi award winning Oscar nominated feature length animated lego movie is an entertaining roller coaster ride for all ages.With a vast cast of overpaid Hollywood stars led by Chris Pratt we see original Lego characters team with the likes of Batman, Gandalf, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and more to foil an evil plot.The first thing that struck me is how good it all looks, considerably better than every other Lego movie I've seen from the flow of the animation to the stunning lighting effects.Okay it is pretty dumb, but it's dumb fun and thats okay by me.Silly but with enough to keep parents entertained this is a roaring accomplishment. I'm not sure I'd consider it Oscar-worthy, but then again most Oscar winners I don't consider deserving.The Lego Movie is a lot of fun and has reaffirmed my faith in them.The Good:Looks incredibleLot of funThe Bad:Still pretty silly in placesMore than a slight sprinkle of Hollywood excess and stupidityThings I Learnt From This Movie:The double decker couch actually sounds quite neatWiping your bum with a hook for a hand is really hardIt's not expected for a person to marry a marshmallow","

"tuomas_gimli","11 March 2014","I'd be surprised if anyone saw this coming. The Lego Movie is quite simply unlike anything seen in a long while: rip-roaringly hilarious, gorgeous to look at, imaginative beyond belief, a great parody of worn out ""chose one"" clichés and also rather poignant and touching. The first thing one has to mention is the animation. Not only does it look like an amateur stop-motion film with a $500 million budget, but the amount of detail and creativity put into the visuals is just staggering. At times there's so much going on the screen it's almost overwhelming, yet if you look closely you can see that every single thing is comprised of recognizable Lego parts. The various ways the world shifts, breaks, is constructed again, falls apart and moves around is simply a joy to watch. The implementation of real-world objects into the otherwise plastic world is certain to get huge laughs out of anyone, especially the revelation about the ominous superweapon ""Kragle"". The result is a film that looks unlike anything we've seen before.The script is a roller-coaster ride of hilarious gag after another. The jokes come at you so fast you can't catch them all in one viewing, and blink-and-you'll-miss-it side gags clutter the screen. No running gag wears out its welcome, no joke is overplayed or overemphasised. The characters are all funny and likable with enough personality to them to fill up multiple movies on their own. Batman especially is a riotous parody of the grim, dark versions of the Caped Crusader we've been stuck with for nearly a decade. And due to Lego having rights for nearly every IP imaginable, you won't be able to guess which mega-franchise is going to turn up next. Despite all this high praise, there are a couple of minor issues. During its third act the tone of the film starts moving to a more serious and emotional direction, which to me didn't work as well as the rapid fire comedy of the rest of the film. The voicework is great for the most part, but amidst all the others it becomes rather apparent that Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson are live, not voice actors. It's not that their performances are bad, they just seem rather flat and lifeless in comparison to the rest of the cast. The Lego movie is a downright masterpiece, there's no two ways about it. Incredible visuals and animation combined with a hilarious script, dazzling creativity and good characters make it one of the best and most original animated films in a long time. Some minor hindrances can do very little to drag it down, and the end result is fantastic.","

"cameraslie","6 February 2014","The stand out feature of the Lego Movie for me would be the way the Lego Universe was created. The movie paid great attention to detail making everything appear as it would made from Lego, including the water and clouds, and the surfaces people walked on all had the circles sticking upwards a Lego piece would have. Combined with all the yellow faces, and Lego part during building, I was convinced action took place in the Lego Universe.A combination of adult and child friendly humour should entertain all, the movie has done well to ensure audiences of all ages are catered to. The voice cast were excellent, especially Liam Neeson's split personality police officer, making the 2 personalities sound distinctive, and giving his Bad Cop the usual Liam Neeson tough guy. The plot is about resisting an over-controlling ruler, highlighted by the name of the hero's ""resistance piece"". It is well thought through, well written, and revealing at the right times. Full of surprises, The Lego Movie won't let You see what's coming. Best animated film since Wreck it Ralph! Please let there be sequels.","

"bellino-angelo2014","4 November 2019","I had no excitement in seeing THE LEGO MOVIE. Mostly because in Italy it wasn't that known nor advertised when it came out 5 years ago. But one Sunday after lunch I catched it on TV and man I was amazed! I really loved it from beginning to end and I also appreciated the style of the movie.The movie begins with Emmett, a Lego construction worker (voiced by Chris Pratt) that has an ordinary life in the Lego universe. He is soon approached by Lucy and Vitruvius the prophet and they pester Emmett saying that he is the chosen one of the Lego people and the only one that could save them. In fact, there is danger in the air: President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell) wants to create the most powerful glue ever made because he wants to glue the entire Lego universe making it static. So it's up to Emmett, Lucy, Vitruvius and many other characters made in Legos (including Batman, C-3PO, Green Lantern, Han Solo and Superman just for naming a few) to stop President Business' evil plan.What I loved about this movie was its sense of style and CGI animation, with colors so vivid and fresh, like a Lego construction coming to life. All the actors do their best, and let me say it: with a voice cast that includes Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, Will Ferrell, Channing Tatum, Shaquille O'Neal as himself and even Liam Neeson, how can you go wrong? It was also a surprise the part where we see in the attic Ferrell and his son moving the Legos and changing the story just how they wanted to change it. And the songs are very cute.If you never saw this movie before and you happen to catch it on TV, watch it! It's one of those rare family movies of these days that manages to delight and entertain properly both children and adults.","

"PassPopcorn","6 February 2014","To be honest  when I first heard of 'The Lego Movie' I thought it to  be a ridiculous idea and automatically dismissed it as something bad.  However, when I gave it a second thought, I realized I kind of liked  the idea. I mean, why not create a big budget movie that takes place  inside the Lego universe? At least it's somewhat original (there have  been previous Lego movies, but they were all direct-to-video, and from  what I realize  they are much different from this one). And in this  age of spin-offs, remakes, prequels, etc. originality is more valuable  than ever. Add to that the amazing cast in the movie, and I, for one,  needed no more reasons to see this movie  and I ultimately enjoyed it.  The movie opens with the movie's villain, Lord Business (voiced by Will  Ferrell), stealing a mysterious artifact called the 'Kragle' (I hope  I've written it correctly) from a wizard named Vitruvius (voiced by  Morgan Freeman), in order to destroy the Universe. During their  encounter, Vitruvius tells of a prophecy about a Chosen one, who will  find another mystical artifact, called 'The Resistance Piece' and will  put an end to Business's mettle. 8 and a half years later, Lord  Business's alter ego  President Business  is ruling the whole world  in a sort of totalitarian way. We then meet the movie's protagonist,  Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), who one day accidentally stumbles upon  'The Resistance Piece' and is thought to be the Chosen one by a group  of Lego characters called the MasterBuilders.  Despite the fact that The Lego Movie's plot summary may seem a bit  complicated (and despite the fact that I hailed the movie's originality  a moment ago), the movie is actually pretty predictable and formulaic.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing  actually, the movie has an  explanation of some sort for why it is so predictable  but the movie  does get slightly tedious from time to time. The only other possible  downsides to the movie besides that, are the movie's third act, which  gets clingy in some parts, and some of the action scenes. I like how  the animation is a combination of both stop motion and CGI, but this  unusual style of animation may be hard to follow during a few action  scenes  and I fear this scenes might be even harder to follow if you  decide to watch the movie in 3D. Nonetheless, all this downsides to the  movie are easily overshadowed by its qualities.  The movie's biggest quality is definitely that it is fun. The Lego  Movie is a nostalgic look back at childhood and it helps to realize  that our child games were often very silly, ridiculous, over the top  and funny  and in that way The Lego Movie could be better appreciated  by adults than by children. Virtually almost every scene contains a  silly joke or gag and I was constantly giggling throughout the whole  movie. The Lego Movie easily succeeds in being a feel good,  ridiculously entertaining movie that is worth your time. Moreover,  another The Lego Movie's quality is that it has quite an impressive  cast (Pratt, Ferrell, Banks, Day, Brie, Freeman, Hill, Neeson,  Offerman, O'Neil, etc.), that portrays a bunch of very colorful and  memorable characters. In short, if you are interested in watching a  nostalgic throwback to your childhood or just want to watch a fun,  feel-good movie, you mustn't skip The Lego Movie.  Rating: 8/10","

"CriticalOfEverything","29 January 2019","Everything is Awesome? Everything in the movie is Awesome? The Lego Movie is Awesome. There we go. This is easily one of my favourite animated films of all time and one of my favourite movies in general. It's not only what I think to be Phil Lord and Christopher Miller's second best film (second to Spider-Verse) but there's just something about it that is so sweetly and charmingly nostalgic about it to me, not just the fact that it's Lego (although that is a main reason why this film resonates with me and many others). Maybe it's the outstanding animation, the self-aware and clever humour, or the messages about Lego and different builders being unique, or maybe just all of them together. But most of all, this film just makes me happy. There is never a dull moment in this film and it definitely deserves every single bit of praise it has gotten over the years.","

"jonathan-e-denny","7 February 2014","I was the only adult who didn't bring kids to the theater and all I can say is that I was leading the clapping when the credits rolled.""The Lego Movie"" was an awesome, super creative, and extremely satisfying film for all ages- that is, if you have ever played with Legos. Even people that have never bought a Lego set will this enjoy this awesomely humorous and in the end, heartfelt movie.(Notice I am using the word awesome a lot, because one cannot stop singing the ""Everything is awesome"" song played in the movie. Too catchy!)The creators did a wonderful job putting all the classic things about Legos and making a new movie packed with humor.The voice actors were outstanding. You can tell they really enjoyed doing the movie and put in a lot of effort. Liam Neeson was fantastic as the Good Cop/Bad Cop. But the most credit to the success of this movie goes to Will Farrell who played the villain, President Business. He gives such a great effort in this movie which allows you to laugh, smile, and want more Lego awesomeness.I give the Lego movie a big two thumbs up and is by far the best picture I've seen in a few months. Highly recommend this movie to all Lego lovers who have a passion to build and create something awesome, just like the movie makers created this amazingly, AWESOME, film.","

"TheLittleSongbird","4 September 2014","There was the initial worry to whether a film based on a popular (and timeless) children's toy merchandise would work, as results have been mixed on that front, but the trailer did look amusing and the reviews and ratings were great and I as a huge animation fan saw it anyway. The good news is that it does work, yes it is a little rushed at times, especially towards the end, and the last half hour got a touch complicated (if the pacing had slowed down then it would have helped). But what was so brilliant about The Lego Movie was how it took this merchandise and managed to make such a colourful, clever, imaginative and enormously entertaining film out of it when it could have easily been the opposite. The animation is really first rate, the vibrant yet dynamic colours are remarkably vivid and a lot of the visuals especially in the action are very inventive. There is a bright and breezy soundtrack that compliments The Lego Movie beautifully, wasn't that ""Awesome"" song catchy or what? The Lego Movie's chief selling point is that it is an outstandingly well-written film with snappy dialogue and thick and fast jokes that all hit their mark, by far the funniest film I've seen in a while. The action is also block-busting in the very best of ways. It's not all hilarious though, because there is a lot of heart in The Lego Movie and the message will be an inspiration to anybody. The characters have their entertaining quirks and personalities yet the film really allows you to properly care for them as well, the most colourful being the villain President Business. And what a fine voice cast too, with Will Ferrell stealing the show, he is a hoot, but Morgan Freeman's dignified blind seer and Will Arnett's splendidly dour Batman are worthy of note too. Chris Pratt is a likable, chirpy protagonist but not quite as memorable as the supporting roles. To conclude, a brilliant and near-perfect film, animated or otherwise, that people of all ages and the whole family can enjoy. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"bob the moo","30 December 2014","It was approaching the end of the year when I finally joined everyone else and enjoyed seeing the Lego Movie, a few seasons after it was released. Although I try not to pay attention to hype and critical response, it did seem like a positive that the same people sneering at Transformers for being a pumped-up toy commercial, were perfectly in love with the Lego Movie even though it is entirely reasonable to point out that it will do that product absolutely no harm to be literally the building blocks of a bright, colorful film where one of the messages is to be creative and mess around with things. The plot is quite light – a perfectly ordinary construction worker who spends his life following instructions and order, suddenly finds himself declared the Special One by a group called the Master Builders, who are racing to prevent Lord Business from destroying the world as they know it.It is a bare bones plot but the flesh put onto it is actually pretty good. With access to a range of characters and franchises, the film has a lot of fun playing with the Lego brand but also the many other brands and characters that it can draw in; this produces a busy film with lots of opportunities for pop culture references and jokes – a lot of which it takes. This is accompanied by lots of frantic action, which is well animated but perhaps just too busy to be fun all the time (often I struggled to really see what was happening amid all the rapid colorful movement – again the type of comment thrown at Transformers but less-so at this). All of this makes it entertaining and the novelty of the Lego is well used to add to the comedy.Towards the end there is a nice development which I thought was pretty clever and well done; it also opens the door to bring heart into the film by virtue of making it more than cat poster messages and snappy one-liners. It has a reasonable try at this but it was a case of leaving it too late, and it hadn't manage to get this aspect to work through the film in the way that it really needed to have done to sell it totally. Still liked it for trying, but it is an extra at the end, not part of the overall being of the film. This feeling of it being very about the moment, slick and polished is ironically not helped by reading the cast list, since it is a great list of names all sharing the time. The positive of this is that off the page, they are all very good in the film itself, even if many of them are basically doing what we know they can/will do. So Pratt is fun and personable but basically is just doing Andy as a Lego figure. Ferrell, Neeson, Banks, Arnett and others are all good while I enjoyed the many smaller turns ranging from Day and Hill through to Daniels and Billy Dee Williams.All told it is lively fun, with plenty of crafted dialogue and delivery, but it is the area of heart where it doesn't totally hit home; leaving it entertaining but perhaps not quite worthy of the hype.","

"Cinema-reviewer321","9 July 2022","The Lego Movie (2014) is a wonderful time and fun to watch. Having built Lego sets with instructions and enjoyed building things with Lego bricks that are not part of a set, I loved The Lego Movie (2014) as a movie that knows what Legos are and how people can build with them.Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Morgan Freeman, Will Ferrell, and Liam Neeson were all fantastic. The Lego characters they play have their own personalities and are funny throughout.I love how the animation looks like it is in stop-motion animation, but it is using CG that blends well with the Lego backgrounds. The effects on the Lego animation makes it look real and I like how the Lego characters would interact with real life objects.I love the world building with many different Lego landscapes like Middle Zealand or made-up locations like Cloud Cuckoo Land. The movie is creative in how they build with the Lego bricks and the fast-paced animation when building things.I will not spoil the ending, but I thought the twist fits what the movie sets up and how they reveal it is clever. The Lego Movie (2014) is fun, and I recommend giving it a watch if you love building with Legos or if you like the idea of the movie.","

"braddugg","17 August 2014","A fun film that made me a kid. Of course, I am already a proud kid.Never since TOY STORY 3, I had so much fun in an animated film. Also, this film made me nostalgic as I used play with Lego toys when I was a kid. So there are some personal things that are attached with this film, and indeed they drove me to the film more than the trailer of the film itself.The film is a simple, the premise that an ordinary guy can become a hero, only if he believes in himself is well presented. It's not a film that has epic conflict or great story. But it's charm lies in the writing, the wit that is inevitably laughable. Most were laughing out loud in the theater, from my 4 year nephew to a 70 year grand uncle. The animation is surely top notch, we have to consider that making a 3D film with real toys is really challenging, and that's where the animation industry in Hollywood must be praised for. Their quality of animation just keeps getting higher and higher and it's so wonderful for the cinema world over. The music plays a vital role is conveying that indeed ""everything is awesome"". Also, the well choreographed events and the detailing of the animation is great. It's all colorful and pleasing to the eyes and the 3D technology gets due justification in a few scenes too. I am going with 4/5 and would love to catch it again at the theaters with more kids around, I loved it and hopefully if you ever see it, the kid in you is revealed or you are helped a great deal by your own kids.","

"saphira-28454","16 June 2018","A lot of movies can learn from this. It's smart, it's funny, it's surprising, it's emotional at times and the animation is original (characters move and look like actual lego pieces). It has a vision about being special that I don't often see and not only about that. I loved the villain's weapon and the McGuffin, I loved and understood all the characters (especially Unikitty), I loved the jokes. Half of the twists are unexpected while having a story easy to follow.
I can't give it a 10 though because it has a boring scene towards the end. It's not long, but it can make the perspective about the entire film confusing. Also the movie didn't took great risks, it's a pretty standard story, even with the twists and parts of originality.
Definetly worth a watch and still a very good movie despite my nitpicking.","

"ahan-234","7 February 2014","This is my first review. I never wrote a review because I felt other IMDb member had captured what I felt like saying. You may think it's a mistake to see this movie because it's just a ""toy"" movie. But that's what makes it so brilliant. There are so many well known characters throughout the film, and it's rare to see such great character development.Even though there are so many it's really the charming Emmet (Chris Pratt) who steals the show. It really was a LOT better than the previews made it seem. Charming from beginning to end, with a few surprises you won't expect. The less said, the better.","

"Fred_Mopkopf","20 August 2018","Basically everything about this movie has has been said in the other reviews, so I'll confine mine to two points: 1) The realization that this movie is so good BECAUSE it can be mistaken as one big LEGO advert was a fascinating one to me. They found one extremely satisfying way to make ""the"" LEGO movie and tell a beautiful story (watch until the end!). Had they done something like ""G.I. Joe"", ""Battleship"" or the likes, they would have failed. 2) The way they're using LEGO bricks for EVERYTHING, including and not limited to fire, water, foam, smoke, explosions, laser beams, LED bargraphs, clouds, force fields, motion blur (!) and more, is just mind-boggling and alone warrants watching the film. Everything is awesome!","

There have been some incredible family movies over the years and more recently disneys 'Frozen' however going into this with low expectations, they were blown out of the water. What a great movie for everyone to enjoy, its high tempo for the whole thing with a clever and imaginative storyline. After finding success in the gaming industry recently the LEGO has reinvented itself with this movie. Its colourful, funny and more importantly...creative. Do not make the mistake in putting this one down before you see it.","

"jackfull","1 October 2018","Now, I know this film has its annoying spots and very child oriented areas, but when it comes to Lego films of the past, this film is leagues ahead. Lego films in the past either weren't professionally made, or when they were made, the Lego bricks themselves would behave and act in ways that they can't in real life due to their physical mechanics. In past films, mini fig's would move in ways that would bend and melt the plastic, or have human like faces that would scare the crap out of you. Also bricks and mini fig's would be combined with real life environments. So for example you'd have Lego Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi in a cantina, but the cantina looks like it does in the film, not done in Lego. In The Lego Movie however, you can look at just about any scene or area, and you can create that with Lego in real life. For the most part as well, the physical mechancis of Lego are respected in this film too. In addition to the life like movement, with how good the animation was, your first time watching this film you have to ask yourself if its animated or actual stop motion. The animation is THAT detailed. As you go through and watch it, you'll find subtle things like fingerprints or scratches on mini figs, printing on bricks, even mold numbers on certain pieces. This attention to detail is what makes the Lego movie the Lego movie that everyone has wanted for so long.","

It's then 8 1/2 years later. Emmet Brickowoski is a non-special construction guy who only follows instructions. Lord Business is now the President who is planning Taco Tuesday. Wyldstyle is searching for relics and Emmet get stuck with one on his back. She rescues him thinking that he is the Special One.Emmet and Wildstyle are fine but the movie really gets fun when Batman and the rest join the movie. Unikitty is hilarious. Superman and Green Lantern are a great comedy duo. The only small minor complaint is that the visual style is very ADD. The Lego part of the movie could have some more scenes without movement. Sometimes the frenetic visual overwhelms the movie and the jokes. Slowing down some sections could improve the joke retention. It's a small problem. The movie is just good fun.","

"gavin6942","17 November 2014","An ordinary Lego construction worker (Chris Pratt), thought to be the prophesied 'Special', is recruited to join a quest to stop an evil tyrant (Will Farrell) from gluing the Lego universe into eternal stasis.As much as I dislike posting reviews with spoilers, this will have to be one in order to justify my lower rating. For the most part, until 66% or maybe even 75% of the movie, I really thought this was one of the best animated features I had ever seen. It looks great, the story is good (even if the message is a bit lame and blunt), and there are some genuinely funny moments with old characters in new situations (Lando and Batman, for example).But here is where they lost me: the introduction of human, live action characters. When the already obvious message of being against conformity and growing up suddenly gets even more obvious by showing the interaction of father and son, it loses me. Why do we have to go there? And why do we have to have the Lego universe exist in a kid's imagination and not some real place?","

Innovative animation mixing stop-motion and CGI (where it stops and starts I don't know, that's the charm and wonder of the technique, like Robot Chicken if it had a budget, which one of the guys who does the show worked on the film so that makes sense), and almost non-stop comedy - even when it's not all huge laugh-out-loud laughs, there's endless cleverness but always with a goofy wink and slapstick. It's the Looney Tunes for our times. The ending isn't perfect - the message of everyone being ""special"" I think gets muddled with ""everyone be creative"", which aren't the same things though the directors try for both ways. But that's a nit-pick really; this is on the level of popular-innovative entertainment as Toy Story.","

"boatsfra","20 July 2014","Just watched The Lego Movie last night...wow...I haven't laughed this hard OUT LOUD at a movie in so long! As a Lego fan growing up, I was eager to see it after the great reviews, and it surely didn't disappoint. All the characters are alive and downright hilarious...from Batman to Green Lantern and Kitty and Abe Lincoln. I can't give away the plot, but it is clear the producers and directors also have an affinity with Legos. The underlying message comes across as fresh; a message everyone can relate to. I enjoyed the ending, although when it came I was exhausted from laughing and giggling for an hour and a half. This movie earns the high marks due to the attention to detail, the humor, and the funny story. A definite 10.","

"sunergos","2 April 2014","I usually enjoy children's films more than my children (Shrek and Toy Story being two examples). This one didn't quite hit the mark with me. There's enough to keep the children amused throughout and the graphics are what you would expect from today's CGI standards. However, the humour doesn't sparkle like the titles I mentioned above, and the whole film had a claustrophobic feel to it, a bit like Tron Legacy. The ending, though charming, was a little lame, I felt. I went to see it based on the score given by previous viewers, but won't be bothered if I don't see it again. One other gripe - the continual playing of the 'Everything Is Awesome' song became very irritating- even the children commented on this.","

"eddie_baggins","7 April 2014","Look at the risk of sounding like some type of Grinch everything is not awesome with The Lego Movie, perhaps the first ever movie to be 100 minutes of pure product placement marketing at its finest and a movie that gives all new meaning to the word ADD.Visually fantastic and designed in an absolutely flawless way there is no doubting that The Lego Movie is a feast for the eyes and in many senses a throwback to the age in which I am sure we can all remember, the Lego years. Tapping into what might just dwell in all of us the movie does bring out a feeling of nostalgia when it comes to the many pieces of yellow bricks we have all spent time with and it's a credit to directing duo Miller and Lord that they worked so hard with the team at Animal Logic in Sydney Australia (yay go Australia!) to produce such a detailed and thriving world but with that you get the feeling someone forgot to make an engaging or in any forms original story.Filling the film with a formidable voice cast which includes the man of the moment Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell amongst many others it's sad to say that the actual characters here are not that endearing. What makes an animated movie like Toy Story or The Lion King such a joy for ages young and old is its ability to tell a meaningful story with a bunch of characters that go beyond their existence as animated beings and The Lego Movie doesn't do this. Emmett is a lame excuse for the antihero and other characters are all cookie cutter caricatures from better movies. With the characters hard to fall in love with the story also fails at producing the goods with it way too confusing for any child under the age of 10 and with a motto that seems to be throw as many jokes at the screen in as short a time as possible the film suffers from a desire to be funny far too often.No doubt appealing to many people the world over (reviews and box office clearly attest to this) and as a kid I can imagine this being a pure visual joy, The Lego Movie is also a sad reminder than it many ways the simplicity of animated tales has been hijacked in favour of a sugar riddled tale that sadly works for children of the modern age whose attention spans are shorter than a goldfish's and want everything faster and sooner than ever before. Great work by the marketing gurus at Lego and Animal Logic, they must be laughing all the way to the yellow bricked bank.2 and a half bricks of Lego out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com","

"billygoat1071","11 February 2014","The Lego Movie sounds like a sneaky excuse for Hollywood's lack of new ideas, and so they have to pick a random popular material to adapt it on screen as an easy cash-in. I mean there is so little reason for this to exist since the product has been so popular in years, thus a full-length advertisement won't be that necessary. Fortunately, it hires the right people to bring it to life and the right choice of animation to make it look more appealing than the typical CGI animation. Overall it's all quite fun, probably too fun it sometimes forget to think through its plotting, but no one in the world will ever care about it because if a movie is having a good time, so will the audience.The plot gives relevance to the toys: it's a fight between how they use them, it's either for playing to build more creativity or just displaying them as models. It's a clever way to justify the source material and it's obvious that the people behind it are really enjoying playing around. At some point the action becomes too fast and unstoppable which makes it difficult to concentrate at the exact storyline. But things get fixed when it finally introduces the central theme because right there it gives a whole lot of sense in this crazy world of blocks.The animation is the landmark here. Though they're not actual toys being animated into stop-motion, but the amazing computer effects make it look like it is (a little like Flushed Away but with more life-like graphics). In spite that the action runs almost forever, they're just limitless fun. It takes you from place to place without betraying the aesthetics of the traditional stop-motion and it looks quite magnificent. The entire cast is full of delight. Chris Pratt is very likable as Emmet and that friendliness is what the character needs. Morgan Freeman brings an obvious gravity to his role. Liam Neeson and Will Ferrell are both pretty fun as the villains. And Charlie Day is just hilarious in his, although single but memorable, punchline.The Lego Movie might be just a long advertisement and we know product placement at the large extent is the creepiest thing we might encounter at cinema's very existence, but the quality it provides is a huge pardon from that fact, because it brings a genuine heart and sincere affections to the source material which keeps it from being nothing more than a cynical cash-in blockbuster. It sometimes needs to calm down a bit, but again, no one would even bother. The Lego Movie is just filled with excitement, nostalgia, and wonderful animation that is impossible for one to dislike.","

"tedg","13 February 2015","The outer story is about a kid and his dad who doesn't understand play. An inner story has tokens that elaborate on this, a story that is mostly flashiness. The animation is based on Lego and I am sure there is a large franchise in the works. An inner, inner story is about an intrepid girl who doggedly searches for the legendary special piece. She is a master builder and it is she that repeatedly saves the day and pulls the hapless hero through the story. This character is sadly drawn. She has identity issues, picks her men unwisely and is disappointed in not being the chosen one.At the end of the movie, when all else is reconciled, her agency is removed as she becomes 'the girlfriend.' That agency is insultingly replaced by the boy's little sister. I think we need to see her again, and see her master her situation.","

Yet, like all the super hero movies of the decade, it has fast cuts. And that's about it. Fast cuts and a soup of Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Matrix and others. Not a trace of creativity. Just a recipe to please the crowd: same old in a new package.The only thing that puzzled me was why lord business? The dumb toy fighting the business? The business that made LEGO a monopoly? Oh! Yes.

"P3n-E-W1s3","22 June 2017","This is an atrociously boringly unfunny and predictable movie, though it's beautifully shot. All the faults lie with writers and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.The synopsis of the movie is pretty decent and should have resulted in a good movie. A regular Lego construction worker, Emmet, finds out that he's the master builder of an ancient prophecy that states he'll save the world from the craggle and Lord Business.Where the story falls short is the overused and clichéd jokes and characters and they were telegraphed so early you knew they were coming. For example, Emmet has only had one original design idea - a double- decker sofa; so when asked to build something when they are trying to escape from Bad-Cop and his minions, he builds (you guessed it) his double-decker sofa while everybody else builds the submarine; then when the sub is destroyed by Bad-Cop guess what survives... yep, you're right the sofa. I was groaning and shaking my head. All too predictable.Next major fault is the direction, there are lots of scenes that are dragged out too long, in particular, the scene where Bad-Cop / Good-Cop (which was a very inventive idea) is interrogating Emmet. Bad-Cop gets angry and goes mental and kicks a chair around the room. It's not that funny a scene and it becomes boring quite quickly as the directors stretch the sequence out and actually diminishes the scene.Another thing the films suffers with is the vocal talents. With the exception of Will Arnet as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle / Lucy, and Nick Offerman as Metal Beard, the rest of the voices just don't quite fit their character. I am not a big fan of Will Ferrell though I have to admit he's not too bad here as he reigns in some of his outlandishness. However, he should have been more intimidating, mean, and menacingly voiced for his character of Lord Business. I felt embarrassed for Morgan Freeman as he sounded tired, for the most part, in his rendition of Vitruvius. Then there was the grating and annoying tones of Unikitty, played by Amanda Brie, who had me reaching for the remote and the off button. I did like the way that they incorporated original voices into the cast as C3P0 was voiced by Anthony Daniels and Billy Dee Williams voiced Lando - shame they couldn't do it with the rest of the ""Known"" cast.The only good thing this film had going for it was the Lego itself and it's CGI generation. Had the rest of the film been as good these scenes it would have been a masterpiece of filmmaking. However special effects cannot carry a film alone.To be honest I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody. There are a lot of much better kids films out there... So go treat yourself and watch one of them. I wouldn't even push this for the Batman element, even though he's one of the main good elements he's still not enough... and he even starts to wear thin as the movie progresses... I'm now a little worried for The Lego Batman Movie.","

"MediaPanther","6 February 2014","Boasting a killer sense of humor and a surprising amount of heart, The Lego Movie is a film that is not just made for kids. It's made with the those small, colored building blocks in mind, easily bringing memories to life for the adult who played with Legos growing up.It's the underdog tale of Emit Brickowski (Chris Pratt), a standard mini-figure construction worker. Emit, like everyone in his city, lives his life based on instructions drawn up by Lord Business's (Will Ferrell) all encompassing corporation in the sky. When it's discovered that Emit is a prophesied savior of the world, called ""The Special,"" he must prepare to become a ""Master Builder"" to defeat Lord Business before he freezes the whole world. Along the way, Emit gets help from a tough as nails female mini figure, WyldStyle (Elizabeth Banks), a wise but blind wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and Batman (Will Arnett), along with scores of other familiar characters and faces.The film has a super fast pace, with many layers of humor that will keep you laughing and engaged the whole time. Pratt (Her) breathes life into Emit as a manic ""Everyman"" character that you root for, as well as relate to. Arnett's Batman is an uber Alfa male, and every line he utters is quotable and hilarious. As the villain, Ferrell is fun, and with a surprising twist in the story, his performance becomes the heart and soul of the film.Unfortunately, there's a lack of female influences in the characters of The Lego Movie. Banks (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire) does a fine job bringing WyldStyle to life, and she represents everything a strong independent woman should be. Alison Brie (Community) plays a My Little Pony hybrid creature named Unikitty who is sugar and spice and everything nice, but she does not truly represent another female character, as ultimately she is more of an abstract idea of a character. There are a few brief moments with Wonder Woman (Cobie Smulders), however she is overshadowed by the machismo and gruff of Batman. It would have been lovely to see Wonder Woman work side by side with the male heroes to save the world, but she is regulated to cameo status.A combination of stop motion and CGI animation, the film is visually brilliant. The detail that has been taken to create this universe is astounding. You watch as entire worlds are destroyed in a flash with red, orange, and white Lego brick flames, only to see them built up again. The film is worth the 3D ticket as it enhances the experience and gives the visuals more depth.The Lego Movie is a pure delight. It's everything a humorous movie should be- visual, funny, and touching. It's been made for all audiences to enjoy. Bring the kids,but don't be surprised if you end up loving it more.-stina@mediumraretv.org www.mediumraretv.org","

"Robert_duder","19 June 2014","I suppose it was inevitable I would be waiting for something astronomically mind blowing in animation and fun when it came to The Lego Movie. The hype around this has been unfathomable. Full blown adults told me ""the best movie they've ever seen."" I heard nothing but how hilarious and it was and the cheeky nods to other films so I was eager to watch it. I don't think I was ""hyped"" but I certainly had expectations. Now don't get me wrong, The Lego Movie is fun and cute but I had some definitive issues with it and I am completely convinced now that this one of those movies that sort of mass-hypnotizes audiences and everyone sheep life jumps on to the bandwagon. I'm sure I've been guilty of it too but not for this one. I just didn't see the glorious animated feat that everyone else did. I honestly think the film has a distinctive dark, sarcastic undertone and I felt like they were often actually making fun of naivety and the pure quality of childhood toys. It felt a little jaded in that way and maybe that's what adults liked so much about it in some weird way? I guess I like my animation to be cuddly cute with sweet morals and this wasn't it. It has a moral but is it showing it in a sarcastic way? The humour is okay...couple of good chuckles but roll in the aisles? Far from it. I thought the script felt a little generic and nothing really fresh in the idea.The cast is a whose who of Hollywood comedians led by Chris Pratt as our unexpected hero Emmett. Pratt is very good and absolutely captures the right tone for Emmett. If they did one thing right it was creating Emmett to be the focus of the story because he feels like an iconic animated hero. Will Arnett, Elizabeth Banks, Alison Brie, Will Ferrell and Morgan Freeman all stood out for me in their vocal performances of various sizes throughout the film. There are a host of other Hollywood stars doing voices and they all do very good. There are a ton of characters in the movie, this is both a pro and a con for the film. It often feels too packed and because there are so many characters you get flashes of real iconic characters for only a moment and they're hardly used or used poorly (Superman and Green Lantern for instance.) How many ambiguous gay jokes can you pack into a couple of short scenes. The film is a mish-mash of characters that most people absolutely love. I found it just a tad too mish mashed for my liking. Still its very well casted and clear that everyone had a good time doing it. Its also nice to see studios put aside their differences to feature characters from Lord of The Rings, Harry Potter, DC Universe, Star Wars and so on.Co-Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have a decent history in animation having worked on Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs. You will also notice though that most of their experience is in adult features including their animation having worked on Clone High. So their style of direction would be definitely geared more towards adults. I don't mean to say The Lego Movie isn't appropriate for the young generation because it is!! Its an incredibly fast paced, visual thrill ride but without a ton of substance which is fine. The best scene in the film to me was actually when they leave the animated Lego world and turn to the real human world in order to save their people. Even though I had to see Will Ferrell's face (I'm not a fan) it was easily the best, unique and most well developed turn in the story. Kids will and do love the insanely frantic action and the nods to Lego building (which I honestly was sort of tired of early on in the film.) Its a decent story, a fun movie but I don't really feel like most do that it is some sort of amazing, best film of the year material. As much I despise the gimmick of 3D I would have liked to have seen this in 3D because visually it is a masterpiece!! Unfortunately for me the story lacked development, felt a little dark and jaded and didn't truly floor me the way I expected from others' reaction. However, all this being said I assure you that ""Everything is Awesome"" song will be rolling around in your head...for weeks. 6.5/10","

I decided to re-watch it later when I was more refreshed. Looked at a different perspective the film was better and less annoying.I could never fathom how they made an animated film about Lego. The whole idea sounds bizarre on paper. Its actually lo-fi CGI with added inventiveness. So a clone worker is suddenly mixing it up with Batman, Gandalf and Han Solo (all legoised) as well as fighting the evil Lord Business.The film then switches track with its underlying message that kids just want to have fun with toys and play with them rather than dad having a prized collection, all neat and tidy. Something I might be guilty of myself according to my offspring!","

However, with that being said, the film could've done without so many songs. It almost felt like watching a Disney-esque musical. Chris Pratt voicing Emmet was the highlight of the cast, aside from the live action version of Will Ferrell. The story was not the worst you'll see, fairly entertaining. And the new characters alongside the known characters was fun too, a good mix.Other than that, it might get annoying to continuously hear the song, Everything is Awesome! Still a great film.","

Kids want fun. You can pack a few important messages (like Disney's Wreck it Ralph ) had; but without loosing the main goal; make the movie fun.Lego's Movie with static very static characters and not particularly interesting action fails miserably in that department. The ending itself is so forced that feels like ""out of ideas"". Many people saw the movie; but I do not think many will repeat like happened with Frozen or Wreck it Ralph.","

The masterbuilders can only count on the ""Special,"" a minifig destined to save the world by putting the Piece of Resistance on the Kragle. Emmitt, a regular construction minifig turns out to be the hero.The Lego Movie is a new twist on an old idea, what some critics would call a dystopian science-fiction piece. These stared with George Orwell's 1984 and have come to full fruition recently in the movies with The Hunger Games. The purpose of these movies is to exaggerate some aspect of our society, usually an oppressive government or capitalist system, in order to ""expose"" it.In the case of the Lego Movie, it is entirely peculiar that the villain is ""Lord Business."" After all, there are barely any better capitalist ventures in the world than Lego, and this movie in particular has already grossed $260 million. Making a boatload of money off of a critique of Capitalism strikes me as a bit disingenuous.Nonetheless, one of the reasons for the big gross is that this movie is actually pretty good. There's lots of laughs, great animation, even interesting plot twists and some genuinely touching human drama. You have to love a movie that gives prominent cameos to both Abraham Lincoln and Shaquille O'Neal. Fair to say you are likely to be entertained by this movie, and that is better that simply getting a boring infomercial for Legos.The problem is that these guys are criticizing Lord Business all the way to the bank.","

"ironhorse_iv","20 February 2014","Legos is probably the most successful toy line in the World. It has its own theme park, series of video games and now its own film. Directed by Phil Lord & Chris Miller, the Lego Movie is surprising pretty good creative, it builds well on its Lego concept. The movie is about Emmett Brickowski (Chris Pratt), an ordinary construction worker who doesn't really stand out from the crowd. He comes across, an out of this world relic call 'the Piece of Resistance"". He learns from the Wizard Vitruvious (Morgan Freeman) & a mysterious woman named Wild Style (Elizabeth Banks) that the Piece of Resistance is the only way, to stop the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) and his henchman, Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) from using a super weapon call the Kragle that can freeze the universe perfectly in place. Emmett join the Vitruvious's group 'The Master Builders', people that are capable of building anything they need, both with great speed and without instruction manuals as their prophecy chosen one call the 'Special', whom will bring balance to the all the worlds of Legos. It's really has this odd, Michael Crichton's Westworld, the Wachowski's Matrix series, and Michael Bay's Transformers series going on with it. I love how the characters jump into different worlds. The movie is pretty smart, using not only pop culture themes worlds, but also ancient stories like Cloud Cuckoo Land taken from the book 'The Birds' by Aristophanes, about an unrealistically idealistic state where everything is perfect. The variety of some of this theme worlds are honestly real toy line set such as the Old West & Pirate World. They even mention Fabuland, Duplo, and Bionicle toy franchise. The computer animation is amazing. It has that glitch-prone characteristic of what a Lego movie might look like. While, it's not stop-motion, at all. It's really does look like a really good old fashion homemade Youtube Brickfilm movie. Even some of the running themes, remind me of earlier Brick films such as Lindsay Fleay's 1980's hit, 'the Magic Portal'. I give mad props to the filmmakers would decide to change the frame rate to 15 FPS for the smoothest motion, which give the movie, its style. Everything in the movie was designed to look as if built out of Lego pieces. This even includes effects like water, fire, laser bolts, explosions and smoke. Without spoiling too much, a lot of various Lego characters, either original or from licensed properties, make cameos or play bit parts. These include characters from, Star Wars, DC Universe, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, NBA, and many. The voice cast was excellent, especially Liam Neeson's split personality police officer. The second had to be Will Arnell as Batman. He really got that down. The worst in my opinion had to be Will Ferrell. I had to say, he could had done better as the man upstairs. He could had shown more emotional in that hug. Other minor faults of the film is that the movie kinda go against Lego's founder, Ole Kirk Christiansen's policy of not war & violence wanting to make seem like child's play. It was nothing too violent for the kids. Some parents might find some scenes disturbing like a Lego figure getting beheaded or getting frozen. Still, it was made in a light hearted matter. The combination of both stop motion and CGI is a bit hard to follow during a few action scenes. There was way too much things on the screen, going so fast that it's hard to figure out, who or what is going on. It's harder if in 3D. The humor is full of one-liners, inside jokes, and subtle allusions that depending how much you know, would tell if it's funny or not. A lot of the humor kinda goes over the head of some of the smaller children, and certain people. The satire and parody elements stand out, often downright mocking other similar films. Unfortunately, this falls into a very common criticize of the film not being more original. The movie is actually pretty predictable and formulaic if you think about it. It all sounds like a scenario dreamed up by a child who's read one too many comic books. It has the same ""chosen one who would save the world"" concept we've seen a few times before, but the way it's executed in the movie is very clever and the twist that occurs during the third act explain why the theme was so clichés. Even so, it's still formulaic as hell. The pacing is very brisk and moves the story along very nicely. The good things about the film is its unrepentant critique of social conformity themes. Much of the conflict revolves around organization art vs chaotic art. The movie's villains is George Orwell's 1984, trigger-happy cops, a corporate oligarch as president, rampant government surveillance and an oppressive system of compliance and mindless acceptance. The film's pop tune, ""Everything Is Awesome,"" by Tegan & Sara is as catchy, but also frightening. Songs chosen by the government keep the masses pacified. The lyrics aren't just a generic call for teamwork and positive thinking, call for also conformity and consumerism, nothing short of a reminder of the fascist regimes of the 20th century like Hitler's Strength through Joy program or North Korea's K-Pop program. The happily and unquestioningly pays $37 for a cup of coffee as a good consumer should do. It's like paying for an over expensive movie ticket and popcorn. At less, the movie didn't take our beloved childhood memories of Legos, and use it a cheap, hollow cash-in or bloated, special effects. The Lego Movie reminds us that the power of imagination and teamwork can go together in the process of building and creation. Recommend to the highest degree, no matter who you are or how old you are.","

"grandmastersik","21 February 2014","My boy loves all the Lego cartoons on TV so, obviously, I thought he'd enjoy the film.Unfortunately, the powers that be behind this, opted instead to try to blend The Matrix with Kevin Smith-esque constant nods to American pop culture to appeal to ""fanboys"" who played with the little bricks and yellow people as kids, pumping it all up with a (disjointed) plot to fully expose the brand's toy range and maximise the action (chaos) on screen, regardless of how pointless it was. The result - with incredibly fast action sequences even I had trouble keeping up with - was something that both bored and bemused my boy... who luckily, had a big bag of sweets to keep him entertained.And don't even get me started on the ending... which was so ""deep"", ""metaphorical"" and ""clever"" that parents all around me were consoling their children with the promise that it was almost over...Ultimately, what let the film down was an unclear target audience: in an attempt to cater for parents and 20-something nerds, it left parents frustrated by the fact that their 6 year olds just didn't get what was going on for the most part and lost interest as soon as their popcorn ran out.Others may complain that this film was nothing but an advertisement for Lego toys, but come on, wasn't that the whole point?","

"JorgeLMC","13 August 2014","One of many done in good crop of animations that cinema is providing increasingly more often. A definitive example of smart and edgy script, which can enjoy brilliantly the legacy of one of the most popular toys of all time. A universe that seems to come from a psychedelic hallucination in breakneck pace, is narrated the journey of Emmet, the most common Lego character, that quiet life amidst the building blocks, will become a true hero. Masterfully using the resources of dystopian fiction plus lots of humor, and a visual that never fails to impress, ""The LEGO Movie"" is tailor- made for generations accustomed to the pace of video games, that with quite a collection of characters charismatic , a ton of colors and creativity, will deliciously take you until the surprising and affectionate outcome that celebrates the power of childish imagination.","

"daritio_chileansteel","10 February 2014","I go to see this movie with other four people, and neither of us like it. I was so disappointed, because the trailers make the movie seems like a really funny, unexpected and unique adventure. So, when I came home and know that have a 8.9 in IMDb is just make me feel worst.In my case, the humor is not funny, is like they try so hard, the action scenes are to fast to really enjoy them and I found the plot no interesting at all. And the worst was the characters, which aside of Batman, were too plastic, predictable and just boring for my taste.To me, this is just a huge commercial from Lego, but that's just me.People really like this movie, and that's great! I'm happy that people can see thing in stuff that I don't, but personally, I found this movie already very overrated.","

"PartialMovieViewer","28 March 2014","If you have young children at home, take them to see this movie – it's a must. This is THE kids' movie of the decade. Yes, this flick was designed for the child equipped with a bottomless pit of energy and in dire need of a nap. Hi energy scene after hi energy scene left me exhausted and physically drained. Talk about zapping the energy out you. At the end of this carnival of spasmodic plastic rattling and the ceaseless repetition of, 'Everything is Awesome', I thought my soul had been sucked out of my eyeballs and felt bodily fluids oozing from my ears. Granted, the theme is a common premise, but it is easy to overlook. What theme you ask? Crying out loud - it's echoed throughout most 'blockbusters' recently produced. You do know the theme, right? Here it is as a reminder, ""Big Brother is pushy and overbearing, and brainwashing the masses. The only way to overcome the 'The Collective's Control' is through the brave, selfless act of an individual. (kind of cuts against the grain of Hollywood – I like that)."" The cool thing about this movie is that good beats evil using happy-happy-joy-joy methods (and LEGO Batman – of course) and not arrows shot from burning girls or some powerful, magical female divergent idol. One sad note though. Even though I did see the movie I forgot what it was all about. Now remember I do know the movie was a lot of fun, the story left very little impression. Let me see, how would I put this movie in a nutshell? Let's say you had to save the entire world. You also had a box of cute kittens and you gave them each double-shots of espresso – what would you remember? See this movieyou will like it and then you will appreciate your bed.","

"Michael_Elliott","1 March 2014","The Lego Movie (2014) *** (out of 4)Entertaining, if a bit overrated, animated feature about an average LEGO man who is mistaken for a MasterBuilder and is selected to lead a charge against an evil man wanting to put glue all over the city. THE LEGO MOVIE has become a huge hit with people and I must admit that I'm a little shocked. Yes, everyone knows what a LEGO is but when I first saw the trailer for this film I never thought it would connect like it has. With that said, I found the movie to be slightly entertaining but in my opinion it has been overpraised and over-hyped by some. Tastes certainly will vary but perhaps my dislike of playing LEGOs when I was younger had something to do with me not connecting with the picture more. However, even my four-year-old didn't seem to be caught up with the film like he has been with some previous pictures including FROZEN. I thought the animation was clearly the greatest thing about the picture as you can't help but sit there and watch this made-up world and be amazed at how realistic they were able to make it look. Everything is made to look like a real LEGO and the way they pulled this off was simply amazing. I also thought the vocal performances were very good with Will Arnett, Liam Neeson, Elizabeth Banks and Will Ferrell really standing out. I'm not going to reveal the twist at the end of the picture but I thought it worked extremely well. There were some issues that I had with the film including the rather bland leading character and the fact that we're given yet another story that was just way too predictable and standard for its own good. Still, THE LEGO MOVIE has enough going for it to make it worth viewing.","

"caseymoviemania","5 February 2014","For more than 60 years, Lego has entertained kids all over the world with their famous colourful interlocking plastic bricks. Now thanks to directors duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS, 21 JUMP STREET), we finally get to watch the long-awaited LEGO MOVIE in the big screen for the first time ever!WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) is an ordinary Lego mini-figure who works at the construction site. He lives his routine life by following ""instruction manuals"", until one day he is mistakenly identified as the Special -- Master Builder, to be exact -- by a tough young woman named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks). Soon he meets an old blind wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and joins a fellowship of strangers including Batman (Will Arnett), Metalbeard (Nick Offerman), Uni-Kitty (Alison Brie) and Benny the ""1980-something space guy"" (Charlie Day), on an epic journey to stop the evil tyrant Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from destroying the Lego universe on Taco Tuesday by gluing it altogether.THE GOOD STUFFFor decades, Lego is widely known to kids as a toy that allows them to unleash their creativity. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller clearly understands what makes Lego such a long-lasting toy phenomenon till now, and successfully translating that very idea into a spectacular animated feature. Thanks to the effects team from Animal Logic, the seamless mix of stop-motion animation and CGI are very eye-catching. The action are imaginatively staged to maximum impact it's almost like riding a roller coaster. Lord and Miller also have fun times parodying plenty of Hollywood famous blockbusters and other creative properties including DC comic characters (e.g. Batman, Superman and Green Lantern); Gandalf from THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE HOBBIT trilogy; STAR WARS, NBA All-Stars (which includes Shaquille O'Neal himself) and even William Shakespeare, to hilarious result.All the voice cast here delivers first-rate performances. Chris Pratt is wonderful as Emmet, while Elizabeth Banks brings superb tough-girl attitude as Wyldstyle. Then there's Will Arnett, who perfectly brings the trademark husky voice of Batman character and Morgan Freeman delivers an entertaining parody of himself as Vitruvius. As for the two particular villains, Will Ferrell is well-cast as Lord Business and the normally tense Liam Neeson lets loose as Bad Cop/Good Cop.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The ""twist"" finale. Well, it's not something out-of-this-world kind of experience, but it is the poignant moment that gives me the true meaning of Lego existence.THE BAD STUFFIt's quite a pity that Phil Lord's and Christopher Miller's overall screenplay feels formulaic. You know, it's like when you stumble upon a plot about ""a chosen person who is destined to save the world"", they are basically more-of-the-same clichés.FINAL WORDSTHE LEGO MOVIE is far from perfect, but with enough fun to be had here, it's a great cinematic experience for both kids and adults.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com","

"socrates99","11 March 2014","What I found was that my mouth was dropping open fairly regularly as I marveled at the ingenuity on display here. If I were saddled with trying to use Legos to make a movie, I think I'd cry uncle in the first minute. The creators of this little exercise in excess not only met the challenge, they knocked it out of the park.Still, this movie was a little too quick and frenzied for my taste. I would have wallowed in the wacky world created a little more, simplified the plot a bit, even if it meant going with a shorter run time. My first thought getting out of the theater was, I'm glad there isn't another hour of it. And that's a shame because this movie was truly inspired.I particularly liked its anti-fascist politics. It was doubly enjoyable knowing some conservatives consider this film an attempt to indoctrinate their children. To me that's just icing on the cake, I couldn't agree more with its cause, but I don't really believe this movie is likely to influence many kids at all. Its position on freeing people's creativity isn't very radical, and the opposite position of making everyone follow rigid rules was not that well developed. But, then, how could it be without inducing a giant buzz kill?I would not advise skipping this movie but don't expect too much and you'll be better prepared. Just about everything in it is awesome!","

"MovieNinjaGuy","8 February 2014","I found it quite hard to engage with this film and I think the main reasons are that it was just too hectic and there was a huge lack of subtlety. Animation studios such as Pixar and Disney seem to simply do this better at a more consistent rate.Sure there are amazing visuals here (hard to tell it's not actually real Lego at times!), tons of gags, some interesting story elements but I found the speed at which things were happening and the story kept unfolding plus the amount of character cameos just uncomfortable. There is a tremendous amount of destruction in this film to the point where it felt like I was watching the last 30 minutes of Man of Steel in a loop. Normally I would have laughed much more at the same jokes that were in this film but I just could not engage with the characters so they just seem to pass me by.Whilst watching it I thought maybe this film is more for kids but in the cinema I was in I could sense the film was just not keeping children's attention as much as say Toy Story has and does, which really is based on the same formula; toys coming to life and living out an adventure. During the film I even thought about leaving. I really thought I would not be missing anything special.I applaud the film makers for a huge technical achievement but I sure as hell can't remember playing with Lego being as chaotic as this film.","

"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","23 March 2014","Everything in ""The Lego Movie"" is, indeed, awesome.Awesome as in the sort of silly yet wily kid-appropriate PG-rated film. In my opinion, this is the best performance by Will Ferrell that I've been waiting for ever since ""Elf"" came out more than a decade ago.It is exceedingly cool that a major-studio family film refuses to simply capitalize on merchandising spin-offs by offering an oppressive 100-minute commercial. Instead, ""The Lego Movie"" manages to be a smartly subversive satire about the drawbacks of conformity and following the rules while celebrating the power of imagination and individuality. It still might be a 100-minute commercial, but at least it's a highly entertaining and, most surprisingly, a thoughtful one with in-jokes that snap, crackle and zoom by at warp speed.I had no interest in seeing this film; however, all my friends that saw it said it was a great movie, and I decided to give it a watch. This is the best film of the year and, as far as I'm concerned, the best film I've seen if a couple of years. It is also the most subversive, pro-liberty film since (I kid you not) ""V for Vendetta"" with smart, well-deserved swipes at the head of the government. Bring your adult friends if you don't have children of your own.It is a wonderful movie, I had the same reaction to it as I had seeing ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story 3"". If you do not have your own child, now is the time to offer to babysit a niece or nephew. It's nice to see that imagination can still show up and surprise you in the best way possible. It was way better than it needed to be, for a toy-based movie. With a message at the end that should be seen by many parents.Best movie of the year, so far.","

"aharmas","23 February 2014","""The Lego Movie"" carries with its name an association to instant likability. In fact, I have never played with the toys myself, but they look like fun, and I can't imagine a kid not falling in love with the possibility of building whatever they wish. The film, unfortunately, falls short because once again it does what Hollywood does best, lots of flash, with very little essence, soul or heart, though it wasn't for lack of trying.Here is an everyman put in the position of saving the Lego universe from the Mr. Business, I guess we're playing with extended metaphors and sarcasm here. I have seen situations and plot devices like these before, but the magic falls short here, quite quickly, after the introduction of the main characters. There is very little to captivate the audience with the very simple facial expressions of the characters. There is some magic in the shots that involve streets, freeways, and distant perspectives, but it is hard to engage our interest when we have close ups.So, after the first 15 minutes or so, you can start feeling how simple the whole enterprise appears, and it an almost palpable feelings how the different members in the audience are trying very hard to like the film. The little tykes are probably more interested in looking at the possibilities of what they can put together at home with the pieces they see in the screen. From this perspective, the movie is no more than a very long advertisement. The adults are glad the kids are quiet, but one can only laugh so much at the ""funny"" lines.I was mostly impressed by the interesting conclusion, which could have easily turned off everyone in the audience, but it is a reflection of some of the most magical and/or sweetest moments in TV and cinema, the revelation that it's all a dream, but that it doesn't really matter. Things are pretty clever at that moment, and Will Ferrell, an actor that I find wooden and tiresome, doesn't do a bad job here. Maybe he is more effective when he is restrained.There are some creative moments, from the voice casting, to the catchy tune that is bound to sell a zillion copies to the unsuspecting audiences, and most incredibly, the cliffhanger for the unstoppable sequel. It was actually kind of cute. Hope the people behind this production do a better job giving us a warmer, better film. After all the eyes in CGI have come a long way from the dazed looks of ""The Polar Express"", and they can do wonders with stop motion. Just look at the amazing work of Tim Burton and his films. There's hope after all.","

"sdguero","7 July 2014","I'm the only person I know that didn't love this movie. After hearing all the rave reviews I had high expectations. I had several issues with the film...-The pacing in this film was very off putting for me. Frenetic start! Character development was weak and things happened very fast for the first 15-20 minutes. It sort of made my head hurt. Then things slowed way down and I found the movie to be pretty boring right until the end.-The plot line, where a father is taking away his kids legos, kind of irked me and it was obvious from the start he was going to come around by the end of the movie. As a Dad, I also thought it had the potential to undermine my authority with my kid a little. -The punch lines just weren't that funny. I chuckled a few times but that was it, and all the best jokes were already in the trailers. -Too much product placement. Lets be honest, the entire move is big ad for Lego. But then they throw in all the other products, and it really made the whole film feel like a giant ""get your parents to buy this!"" commercial to kids. So, there it is. My opinion on a very highly rated film that I just didn't enjoy very much.","

"Gresh854","18 June 2014","How to start of this review? Hmmmmmm. How about ""Everything Was Awesome!"" I know, pretty overused at this point. But the LEGO Movie is awesome and I'm not just saying that, you're guaranteed to enjoy it.Plot - The Story is about a ordinary guy named Emmet who is said to be the special. He eventually goes on this Journey with some Master Builders from stopping Lord Business from doing the evil stuff that he is supposed to do. Surprisingly the plot is really smooth. It takes a while to get adjusted during the beginning but towards the middle, you are totally adjusted to the plot. And the plot seems to work out just perfect not too much not too little.Characters - The cast of this movie is like, to be honest, one of the best casts in an animated film ever put to film. We've got Christ Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnet, Charlie Day, Liam Neeson, even Morgan Freeman put in the films main roles. Each actor portrays the emotions of the character so well. The voices just work with each individual figure. So the characters are portrayed very carefully and well during the film each one at the right time.Animation - The Animation in this movie is so good. You literally feel like you are inside a LEGO world. The animation looks like Stop-Motion, but it's actually computer animated which actually makes everything look a it better. You literally could imagine this happening on your kids or your LEGO's. It's like you are watching little tiny Minifigures going on an adventure. Also when things are blown up or smoke is coming out of vehicles, it's all LEGO bricks manipulating everywhere. It is genius animation, just it just fits with the LEGO movie.What to Except - Pure satisfaction and maybe even more. This is one of those kids films were parents enjoy it just as much as their kids EQUALLY. There is a ton of Pop culture references in the film that everybody today can relate to so much. There is literally non-stop funny humor throughout the film. And a some of it is adult humor to keep the adults very entertained and into the film. What mainly to expect is ""Getting Super Surprised"" When you here about a movie about LEGOs, your just thinking ""it's going to be a huge advertisement for sure."" But it felt like it wasn't advertising anything at all. There were so many life lessons in the movie that are not hard to catch especially to the parents. Family lessons that aren't just any silly all life lesson, but something deeper and more. All these lessons and heart-warming moments are fit into one whole 100 minute movie very smoothly surprisingly. In the end is what will really get you but I can't spoil it because that would ruin the whole movie. So parents, children prepare for a surprising film, trust me.Overall - Overall the LEGO movie is a enjoyment for the whole movie but not just like any old good animated movie. This is something more. Something more, something movies these days should have. It's been more than a decade until we've had amazing movies like this. Disney still has there A-Game on, but I think Warner Bros. Is starting to step up their game. So should you buy it on. Blu-Ray or Watch it? Both. You can watch this so many times and always keep on being entertained. The LEGO movie is one of the, or just maybe, the greatest animated film ever played on the big screen. (A+)","

"kermitkid","30 March 2020","If you think movies based off toys are a bad idea, (Transformers) this proves it wrong. I know it's only February, but I think I can easily say this is one of the best animated movies of 2014. And unlike the Lego video games, the characters actually speak. There's also a lot of cameos from other Lego figures, some of which are characters you might recognize. It's clear the filmmakers put a lot of thought and heart into this movie. The Lego Movie is a definite blockbuster. (Yeah that's right, I said blockbuster.) Exaggerated personalities of DC superheroes also make it a great film for those who are not Lego fans.

"dwpollar","24 March 2014","1st watched 3/22/2014 --- 3 out of 10(Dir-Phil Lord & Christopher Miller): Un-necessarily complicated and unfunny movie based on a created Lego world with interesting animation trying to simulate what it would be like if Lego creations were alive. The story is about a normal guy being given the title of savior of a soon to be destroyed world(which is a much used theme). This Lego person named Emmett is a construction worker in a very formalized society who basically has to now think for himself as the savior and new master builder. This is not an easy transition for him and the movie uses this for comedic effect. Will Ferrell provides a voice over of the evil character in the story who wants things to stay the way that they are. Ferrell also has a brief real-life cameo and provides the best thing, in my opinion, in the movie – a song that rolls during the credits about darkness that he ad-libs as he goes. When a credits song is the best thing in the movie than you know it has problems, and this basically is my resolve(it is one big problem). An idea for a movie, complicated and without humor then becomes an overly expensive mess. My question is why was this movie even made ?? I really don't even think kids will get thru the movie without becoming bored. The animation may hold them for a little while but the complications in the plot will drop them from caring very quickly. Avoid this one.","

He meets a cast of crazy interesting characters such as Wildstyle as well as Batman who really does make the movie even cooler than it needs to be. The animation is crazy detailed and really made to look like stop motion with moving lego pieces which is all extremely vibrant, lively and expressive.The song ""Everyting is Awesome"" is catchy and will stay stuck in your head for days after viewing. The humor is great and all the character are very smartly and sharply written and loaded with spark and personality. The whole movie is filled with personality and will leave you feeling satisfied and inspired from such a breath of fresh air in animation that will have you feeling awesome and making you want to play with your childhood legos all over again","

"Rascutin","7 August 2014","This movie was so so SO overrated. The jokes were terrible and Emmett was insanely annoying! I mean the first line was, ""He's coming. Cover you butt."" The moment I heard that line, I knew the movie was gonna go downhill from there. And I was right! The jokes flew by so fast, they went right over my head. But the ones I did get... weren't funny at all. Now I will admit I enjoyed the character Unikitty (I know, a cat/unicorn. Stay with me). She was pretty funny with the whole happiness thing and she kept saying no about the negative stuff (it's called irony). Plus the ending got boring. Around the time the people appeared on screen, the line cues got slower and slower (and more boring). Most people have been saying that the ending sucked (it did), but I like it because the movie finally ended. Anyway, this movie is bad! The only reason why I'm giving it a generous 5 is because the animation actually was awesome. That was one of the few good things about this movie. So unless you only pay attention to the animation and not the story line, this is not for you.","

"pokemon_trainer_lucas","21 June 2019","When this film came out in 2014, I was not a Lego fan, and I thought to myself ""Why on earth would anybody watch a film about Lego? What has the world come to?""
But, a few years on, and I was heavily obsessed with Lego, and so I decided to buy the DVD of The Lego Movie to see just what I'd missed. And, my God, it was incredible!
It was immersive and witty, hilarious and genius, and no doubt one of the best films I have ever seen! The plot is creative and engaging, and the graphics are incredible, right down to every tiny scratch and fingerprint on the Lego minifigures that add that touch of realism.
If you've not seen this film, then get on eBay and buy the DVD! It'll be the best purchase of your life!","

"Sergeant_Tibbs","28 February 2014","It looks like 2014 is going to be a very full year for movies, starting it early too with a huge family movie and a star-studded caper. Only one more week until The Grand Budapest Hotel which could possibly stand to be my Best Picture throughout the whole year, who knows. However, so far, the year is starting on mild disappointments. Though perhaps I just had my hopes up a little too high. The Lego Movie is good, but it's just getting way more acclaim than it deserves. It's being treated as the new Toy Story for a generation. Quite an overstatement for a film that's likable and quirky but doesn't have the gravitas in its emotion for quite a bold statement. It really could have been a disaster though, they pulled off the marketing perfectly. Completely nailed the idea that this is a film with breezy awesome attitude.The beauty is in the little personal touches as each lego peace has their natural imperfections. Chris Pratt is the perfect casting choice for the lead, I'm very glad he's starting to blow up because his personality shouldn't be limited to Parks and Recreation. He's ideal as a Spongebob-esque naive blank-slate protagonist. The Lego Movie is kind of like The Matrix plus Wreck-It Ralph but unfortunately I just found the film far too manic to register what was going on. Impressive animation especially how it adds so much depth in 3D but too often it just felt all over the place. Not that I couldn't follow the story, I just couldn't catch the details. I never felt jeopardy or tension and it was too messy in its stakes to care deeply. Just a good time. It's a film that deliberately wears its themes on sleeve being very on-the-nose about individualism and so forth.It wants to be a satire but it doesn't commit enough to its observations. While it breaks the fourth wall sometimes in attempts at dissecting its screenplay formulas they just seem like winks rather than deconstructions. It's just a way around using clichés rather than truly criticising them and using them inventively. But perhaps I'm taking a light film a little too seriously, at least its wonderful optimism makes up for what it lacks in conviction. It has several clever ideas and integrations into the real world that make it connect a little more though I do feel like the meta story takes stuff away rather than adds, especially with the melodramatic execution. However, as fun as the film is, I still don't think it can quite get passed the fact that it's a 100 minute advertisement for a toy. It is marketing the spirit of the toy with a touch of nostalgia, but seriously, go buy the toy.6/10","

"The-Sarkologist","6 April 2014","What surprises me about this movie (other than the Hollywood Dichotomy, which I will mention below) is not so much that they made a movie based around the very popular Lego  product, but rather that they took an incredibly long time to actually make it. It is not as if they did not have the capabilities of doing such a movie a while back – in fact I remember watching a stop-motion Lego Star Wars film back in the early nineties, which was passed around on video cassette (unlike these days where I am sure you can get access to many Lego films on Youtube.As for the film, it is a typical film about a bunch of heroes going out and defeating a bad guy. Also, being a film aimed primarily at children (and also designed as a not so subtle advertisement of the Lego  product), it also has the hero of the story as an ordinary person who goes out and does extraordinary things, which is our culture's way of saying that it does not matter who you are, or what your station in life is like, you do have the capability of doing extraordinary things, all you have to do is believe in yourself.However, there is another interesting thing that I call the Hollywood Dichotomy. I noticed it first in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and I have noticed it replicated again here, and that is that this film seems to go against what is expected of a loyal and patriotic citizen of the United States of America. First of all we have the antagonist, Lord Business/President Business – clearly he represents the upper 1%, the executive director of the multi-national corporation, and he is portrayed not only as the bad guy, but as the guy whose power we are to resist. This seems to fly in the face of the idea that the CEO is a leader, a person to aspire to and respect, which is something that is essential in the capitalist society. However, I guess the reason that he is portrayed as the antagonist is not so much because he is bad, but rather because he is standing in the way of your success, and you are not going to become successful until he is out of the way.The other aspect in this film is the idea of following the instructions. What the film is suggesting is that following the instructions is a bad thing and that we are to reject that an embrace our freedom. This, in a sense is what is happening in the United States today, with the creation of a quasi-police state (and we see it here in Australia as well) where those of us who do not follow the rules are considered to be miscreants and trouble makers. In a sense we are to accept the decisions of our superiors, whether we agree with them or not, and to exercise our right to protest and to seek change is discouraged because what that does is that upsets the status quo.","

"michaelRokeefe","17 July 2014","Talk about a Lego world. First of all, you begin thinking like a kid and you wonder...how many Lego sets did it take to make this movie?! Emmet Brickowski(Chris Pratt) lives and works in a world of extraordinary and talented individuals. But ask his co-workers, neighbors and friends...Emmett is just simple, plain and practically unnoticeable. Nothing special about Emmett. He is sometimes made fun of for always following directions at work, at home and in life. One day by accident, Emmett falls and finds a coveted ""Piece of Resistance"" and this now makes him ""The Special"". With this and a little know how, the big mean President Business(Will Ferrell)can be thwarted and the world of Master Builders can be saved from ""Taco Tuesday"" and his total domination.A beautiful Wyldstyle(Elizabeth Banks), her boyfriend Batman(Will Arnett)and wise Vitruvis(Morgan Freeman) team up to unlock Emmett's mindset of always following directions and use some creative thinking to overpower President Business with ""The Piece of Resistance"". After all, Emmett is now ""Special"" and it is his destiny to save the Master Builders of a world made of Legos.THE LEGO MOVIE is rated PG and is family fare. The kids can enjoy this without much supervision; but there is enough action to sustain even a grownup's attention. The notable Mark Mothersbaugh puts his thumb print on the music and Mark Ackland is credited as concept artist and designer. Many other recognizable actor's voices bring vitality: Will Forte, Cobie Smulders, Liam Neeson, Channing Tatum, Billy Dee Williams, Shaq O'Neal and Jonah Hill.","

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7 February 2014","The Lego company is a toy company that has truly stood the test of time. Not only by staying ahead of its competition, but by also being able to adapt and stretch itself across the entire board of the toy-making domain. Think about it, how many franchises are out there that the Lego company has fed off of and co-produced a series of toys after? Numerous, too many to count. Anyone who's a Lego fan will enjoy this movie. There are lots to find entertaining from its design, creative story, action and characters.The story is about the everyday Lego man named Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt). A construction worker who lives his life by the book. Literally, a Lego construction book. And like any other day, his day goes just fine until he makes a discovery that turns his life upside down. The discovery involves a special fragment that could save the Lego universe. Little does Emmet realize is that the world he lives in is a set-up (no pun intended), where a ruler called President Business (Will Ferrell) is a chronic perfectionist who longs to hold a structured order to the Lego universe. And the story only gets more creative from there, partially because of the characters involved. Accompanying Emmet in his journeys is Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), who makes sure Emmet doesn't lose his head and saves him whenever possible. Then there's also the head master known as Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) who gives some very funny scenes. But the one character who steals the screen the most is Batman (Will Arnett). There are just too many scenes to count where Batman has a line that makes every intended funny scene even more genuinely funny. There's even a Lego spaceman that I can only imagine any person who played with Legos must have had at one point in their life. But that's not all, there are even more cameos than one could count, most of which viewers saw in the upcoming trailers to this movie. They all have their own special parts. Even the bad guys are memorable. President Business had good scenes and his henchman labeled as Bad Cop / Good Cop (Liam Neeson) is one heck of a character. In a way, the character reminded me of Man- E-Faces from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (1983).What really helps make this movie funny though is the mix of a clever, imaginative story that blends in great with its respective animation. The story was created by Kevin and Dan Hagemen who also worked as writers for the Lego TV series Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu (2011) and Hotel Transylvania (2012) which also was a very entertaining animated family feature. But the reason why their writing works so well is because of the animation. Kudos to the animation department because they did an amazing job by sticking to what Ray Harryhausen would do - stop motion animation. By using the physical Lego pieces and not CGI, helped limit the characters movements making them funnier to watch. Yes it is apparent when the CGI kicks in but boy oh boy do the animators get creative with how the Lego pieces make up every single thing you could imagine of. Plus, isn't that kind of the whole thing behind Legos? It's also the moral to the story, where Legos were created for people to get creative with.Finally let's not forget action and music, it is one sweet ride. Much of the action scenes are fast paced, include quick wit dialog and some intense scenes as well. Helping that of course is composer Mark Mothersbaugh's score. It has every single kind of the emotion you would want. Hopefully it will be released for the film score collectors to enjoy too. There's even a theme for the movie even though it's not from the score, that is the song ""Everything Is Awesome"". It's a very catchy and bumpy song that'll want to make one get up and dance. I did not see one thing to pick about which is rare.This is one epic Lego film. Every element to the film works great, thanks to its well written screenplay, comic relief given by its voice actors, entertaining action sequences, memorable characters and old fashioned animation.","

I will write more lines because IMDb insists on a minimum content. Not sure why. My opinions about the movie were easily expressed in the first, two sentences. I will simply fill in wasted words and a waste of my time because this site has become so full of itself. Used to be a genuine place to investigate and review movies. Now, we have to log in, verify ourselves as ourselves and type encrypted words to be ""accepted"". Seems to me that Hollywood doesn't really want ""every man's"" opinions.

"jadepietro","21 November 2014","This film is not recommended.Loud, hyperactive, and occasionally amusing, The LEGO Movie was surprisingly highly lauded by many critics and became a huge hit. Written and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the film tackles grandiose ideas of fascism, conformity, and corporate greed for the pre-school set, but the humor is mainly aimed for their parents with so many pop references and nostalgic touches. With nice voice-over work by Chris Pratt, Will Farrell, and especially Will Arnett as the gravel- voiced Batman, The LEGO Movie has some satirical things to say, that is, whenever it calms down to say them. There is so many frenzied chase scenes and shoot-um-up sequences that they overpower the slim story. We are dropped into Lego World where our hero, Emmet, a dim-witted but contented construction worker type runs into an evil dictator named President Business who wants to control this world. He unites the other Lego figures to fight with him against this tyrant.The crude animation is a disappointment. One sees far more clever results on cable television's Cartoon Network or Matt Groeing's far superior Futurama or The Simpsons programs. While the computer generated / live action film stays within the confines of the Lego block design, this option also limits the creative spark. Movement is clunky and awkward like the short, stocky, and generally unappealing Lego figures themselves. The film seems rather schizophrenic, like one of its characters, a two faced Good Cop / Bad Cop figure. It wants to condemn big business and consumerism while willfully selling its product to anyone in the neighborhood.The film resembles the noisy Transformers franchise, both in its overall look, sound design, and hectic movements, with its main goal being its tie-ins and product endorsements. In fact, The LEGO Movie appears to be one long commercial of Legos, by Legos, and for Legos, with a new shipment of characters arriving at the nearest toy store and a new sequel already in progress.

"utgard14","8 June 2014","I'm an old fart as far as this Lego thing is concerned. I remember them from when I was a kid, of course, but that was before they started doing all the stuff with them that they do now. In my day you could just build buildings with them. Not really special buildings either, just ordinary stuff. We also used to tie onions on our belts because that was the style at the time, but I'll leave that story for Grampa Simpson to tell. Anyway, the voicework is great. I especially liked Morgan Freeman as Vitruvius. The story is surprisingly pretty good. I was expecting something kind of dumb but it's actually a fun movie and smarter than I thought it would be. It's something both kids and adults can enjoy. Oh, and I thought the double decker couch was a good idea. Sue me.","

"ricardopthomaz","10 February 2014","I used to enjoy a lot of Lego time when I was a child. I used to enjoy most of what was used from pop culture and references in this movie, so this one was basically a gathering of all that was important to me growing up. Pity that it was kinda generic as a movie... the plot is so convoluted it makes you scratch your head sometimes. Too much references and no time to develop them properly. It was very promising in the trailer, kinda like a mix between Toy Story and Wreck it Ralph, but... those last two, sorry WB, they said it way, way, waaaaaay better the same message you're trying to give us.As a bunch of isolated references from the 80's, it kinda works in that nostalgic sort of sense, as an adult, I got entertained with all the references and I'm pretty sure that kids will have fun beyond belief, too. As a movie, it turns out to be a convoluted mess. I know that they tried to make like (SPOILERS AHEAD!) the imagination of a little kid, but back then, Andy was so much more creative and more addressing! Sorry WB, good try, but you're way better with your DC Animated Universe, so stick with that. If you're trying to overcome Pixar, well... better luck next time. Bottom line, it's worth the price of admission once, but just once, like a fireworks show, one viewing it's real fun, a second viewing though, is out of question.","

"edwardanthony9","6 February 2014","I have to say, this is one rare animation film that could satisfy audience of all ages, but I didn't find it as great as the critics suggest. There all lots of positives, yes, but I find several aspects less than satisfactory, including the soundtrack, and perhaps surprisingly, the twist.Let me start with the positives first. I have to say I was genuinely pleased by the humour that was presented, some of which are easily laughable, even for adults. They range from the weird & foolish actions that would please little kids, to the plain responses & simple jokes that would trigger a laugh on mature audiences as well. This is a smart & rare quality possessed as an animation film.The characters are very much likable and the excellent voice casts simply makes them just that more charming. Emmet is a fun main character as he is simple, ordinary & easily relatable. His funny responses are among those that appeal to adults as well. And pretty much all the characters are easily understandable, and this makes for a great connection between them and the audiences.I thought the overall plot was decent though, and makes for quite an emotional ride with the characters. The twist, however, is a bit more interesting. I have to say it was probably a good twist, in that it makes perfect sense and explains the things that happened before. But to be perfectly honest, for me it wasn't of satisfactory, in fact I was quite disappointed it had to go that way. It kind of eliminates what emotions I have felt of the characters so far. Not a bad twist in terms of quality, but not a likable one, at least for me.In terms of technicality, the visuals were okay, but the soundtrack didn't really appeal. I may have stated in previous reviews that soundtracks make for more intense and interesting scenes. And here, the opposite is true. The soundtrack doesn't seem to accurately convey the emotions, and so the tension of the drama & action was slightly reduced. Other than that, though, this is simply one rare animation movie, in which the whole family can really enjoy, as it caters for all range of audiences.VERDICT:Good: Excellent range of humour, Likable characters, Decent plotBad: Unexpected twist, Weak soundtrackSCORE: 7.5(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)","

"Rickting","21 November 2014","Everything is awesome in The Lego Movie. Everything. Genuinely everything. Every single little thing is awesome. The ultimate product placement movie instead becomes the ultimate 2014 blockbuster, as a likable but unremarkable construction Lego mini figure tries to save the Lego universe from the evil President Business. The only 2014 movie I have seen more than once at the time of writing, TLM held up remarkably well. Some may find it annoying possibly, but for most you'll have to remove that grin from your face with a crowbar. It looks great and could have been stop motion Lego. The CGI is barely noticeable. It's also got an astonishingly good cast all giving fine performances. Even Morgan Freeman is in there. The action, humour and emotion is all spot on. The film is full of white knuckle action, gut bursting jokes and surprisingly thoughtful story lines which make it overall a very entertaining and rich animated offering for everyone. You don't even have to like Lego.The key to movie success is the script. The script is brilliantly written here and absolutely crackles with wit and charm. It's also got some very thrilling moments and pop culture references galore. It's surely one of the funniest movies of the year and although the jokes are simple they're always devastatingly effective. The characters are very diverse and likable as well, and enhance the film's likability factor which is already off the scale. As it has some very nice messages in there too, it's a surprisingly touching film and the ending is unpredictable and moving. Another key element of the film's success is creating a compelling fictional universe for the film which is full of entertaining details. As for the Everything Is Awesome song, you'll never be able to get it out of your head. TLM is a great blockbuster overall which should have been terrible but is instead a total knockout. Outshining everything DreamWorks has ever done by a mile this might be the most fun you have at the movies in 2014.10/10","

"RNMorton","26 February 2014","Legos is one great international company that has redefined itself so successfully in the American marketplace. I guess I can't join what looks to be the large majority of IMDb members in saluting their venture into the movie industry. Sorry, I just didn't get this one. We have this sort of ordinary fungible dweeb in corporate world who becomes the chosen one to save all the fungible dweebs in corporate world from the evil corporate overlord who has his own bizarre plot to freeze all the dweebs for unclear reasons. Along the way we see familiar characters from other fantasy movies, in their own Lego fashion, along with some unique to this movie. The world they present is hardly new (see Cloudy II) and really very unpleasant for kids and dads alike. There are moments of sort of odd and goofy humor and the twist towards the end is sort of interesting but again it doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie. I'm glad for all of the people who enjoyed this, but me and my 8 year old don't share their opinion.","

"stephenlovelette","28 June 2014","I don't like to brag but...I'm a bit of an animation aficionado.2013 was a spectacular year for animated films.Shame on Oscar and the Globes for not nominating all five of these: Frozen, The Croods, Monsters University, Turbo and Despicable Me 2.But, smart as it is, The Lego Movie falls short of this pantheon.I enjoy TLM (although I don't appreciate the title), and you probably will too. Perhaps a bit more than I did.For all the fun character cameos, the original smart writing and Lego fight fireworks; the pacing slackens in the middle.It's a good family movie that's mildly humorous, with the creative cuts and camera transitions that come along with animation. The style's laid on thick, but it works, and the story is a good one.Lego's got a solid voice cast to back it up, lead by Chris Pratt, and my girl, Elizabeth Banks.But seriously, the fights are sick, and there's a lot of death in this film (if you think about it.) I know that sounds creepy, but I'd argue it's imperative to an animated film nowadays. Otherwise how's an adult audience going to feel there's anything at stake?Anyway, if you don't want to see any spoilers, cease reading now.Here's my existential quandary: I simply don't know how to properly review a film like this. The effort and correct ingredients went into the movie-making cauldron and all that came out was a less than spectacular film.My major problem with it is the pacing. It slows down immensely, once the cloud world is destroyed and they escape in a submarine. They hit the water and I'm wondering how many minutes remain.As I said before, the humor is mild at best. There are a couple good laughs, but there are also some jokes that fall flat.One of the funnier parts of the movie is the relationship between Superman and Green Lantern, voiced by Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. These two are becoming quite the comedic team.Will Arnett as Batman is also very funny.Morgan Freeman, as the prophet Vitruvius, is one of my favorite parts. Not only is he particularly chucklesome, but his character distorts the structure of traditional narrative storytelling. For example, he 'makes up' the prophecy.I read Harrison Ford was too busy to record the lines for Lego Han Solo, but they managed to get Billy Dee Williams (as Lando Calrissian) and Anthony Daniels (as C-3PO). I hate to be overly critical, but I'm pretty sure it takes two hours in a recording studio for small voice parts like Lego Han Solo's.Harrison, what gives buddy?And finally, how could I forget Liam Neeson? He did two separate voices as Good Cop/Bad Cop. I like that Liam fellow, he's got talent.Now, there are two parts of this movie that are particularly smart. The reveal of the live action context (in which the Lego universe exists) rounds off the ending in a more than satisfactory way. I'll add this is the second time that Will Ferrell's physical appearance is revealed in a movie (the first is Wedding Crashers.)Themes like conformity and creativity, the imaginary and concrete, physical skill and intellectual knowledge, etc. resound throughout the film.The basic point of The Lego Movie is that life can work both ways. You can follow every instruction manual to the letter, or be the total opposite, a complete freethinker who just powers ahead and doesn't get caught up in the minutia of perfectionism. Life will probably work out regardless, but perhaps we shouldn't grow too rigid, and remained shackled (or 'Kragled') to our own ways of navigating the world.I like The Lego Movie.I just wish the pacing and humor could keep up with the storytelling.","

"andrewnmiller","23 May 2017","When I first saw the trailers for the Lego Movie, I scoffed at it, thinking that it would be nothing more than a gigantic toy commercial for Legos, but much to my surprise, when I sat down to watch it earlier this year, what I got was a thoroughly creative and fun movie that seemed to resonate more with adults than with kids.In a world populated by Lego figurines, the malicious Lord Business discovers a weapon known as the ""Kragle"", but the wizard Vitruvius tries to stop him only to be left vision-less by Business's robots; he foretells of a being called ""the Special"" will acquire a block known as the Piece of Resistance and stop the Kragle. Some years later, an ordinary construction worker named Emmett Brockowski encounters a woman named Wyldstyle at his job and while trying to follow her, falls into a pit and locates the Piece of Resistance, proceeds to touch it then wakes up with the piece fixed to his back, in the captivity of Bad Cop. Wyldstyle then saves Emmett, certain that he is the Special, takes him to meet Vitruvius in the Old West. Now, Emmett, Wyldstyle and the rest of the master builder community must untie in order to stop Lord Business from executing his plans.Given that the story does follow the Matrix in a lot of ways, it would seem like it would be retreading the plot of the 99' movie a bit too much, yet when you see the Lego world, everything in it feels original and hot off the press, something I wish more kids movies would do rather than rehash the same ideas over and over again and it seems that Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the two guys who gave us ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and the Jump Street films, and the writers really knocked out of the ballpark with this one.When it comes to the animation, The Lego Movie has some of the best seen in the last few years and is great enough to rival Disney or Pixar. Not only does it have the look of a beginners stop-motion movie with a high budget, but the magnitude of the detail and the imagination put into the animation is nothing short of amazing rather than just using some cheap CGI. At some points throughout the movie, there's simply so much going on that it's pushing overwhelming limits, yet if one is a careful observer, they might see that every single little item from the people to the sky are built in Lego pieces. The numerous ways the Lego world moves, crumbles, is built again, crumbles apart and changes is just a delight to see. The usage of items from the real world being used in the Lego universe is guaranteed to get a massive chuckle out of anyone watching the film, and the aftereffect is a movie that looks so unlike any other movie we've seen before.The script is a non-stop thrill ride of one sidesplitting gag after another not to mention the jokes often come at you so quickly that it's impossible to get them all the first time you watch the movie, and blink and you'll-overlook-it quips that litter the screen. No joke ever seems to overstay it's welcome or is overdone or overstated with some of the best jokes come from Emmett and well as from other characters throughout the film. One thing that the movies so expertly well is how it pokes fun at the whole prophecy story line that has been such a mainstay in big Hollywood movies and the way that they handle it is both hilarious and yet feels new. There are also quite a few pop culture references ranging from Star Wars to The Terminator and The Dark Knight sprinkled thought-out the movie too.The characters of the Lego Movie are a lot of fun to watch and the assemble cast is one of the best in an animated film since Toy Story: Chris Pratt is the prefect choice for Emmett, playing the eager and innocent sides of the character with ease, manages to be in incredibly funny often getting some of the movie's best jokes and also shows quite a lot of character growth as he learns how to think for himself rather then conform. While I'm not a big fan of Elizabeth Banks, she is awesome in this movie as Wyldstyle, hurling out plenty of sharp quips and kicking ass when she needs to, but she is also so much more than that by being more of a symbol of individually which is an interesting take on a female lead in this kind of movie and certainly better than having her hook up with Emmitt at the end. Morgan Freeman is always excellent is anything he's in and here, he brings the same wise-man vigor as Vitruvius while almost making fun of the other mentor roles he's played in other movies and is truly a delight to watch. Will Ferrell is completely devilish and threatening as Lord Business and yet is a complete laugh riot, channeling his Mugatu character from Zoolander with ease. Charlie Day is a joy as the Lego spaceman Benny, Nick Offerman is great as Metalbeard, Alison Brie is enchanting as Unikitty, Liam Neeson is down right hilarious as Good Cop/Bad Cop, but it's Will Arnett as Batman who steals the movie as there are simply too many times in the movie where he has a line of dialog that makes every intentional funny scene even more laugh-out-loud funny.I really don't have any negative things to say about the Lego movie, it's just superb with great characters, top-notch animation and voice acting, wonderful jokes, and one hell of a catchy song. Definitely a movie worth checking out.","

"timmooreuk","19 May 2014","I absolutely hated this movie. Having paid for my family around £10 each to watch what is basically an advert for Lego, I just feel cheated. I didn't find the cheeky nods and winks to other classic films funny, I didn't find the script funny. It was too loud, too slow, too ... rubbish for me to watch. I'm not sure if this is a spoiler or not but I have no idea what the ending was about, the whole Will Ferrell thing with it's preachy lesson of adults forgetting the value of being able to be creative - complete tosh. My family felt the same by the way. No amount of reading the rave reviews with explanations can hide the fact that this film simply does not live up to the hype.","

"HeyimShibby","14 April 2022","Today I watched the lego movieGotta say this was a surprise, I've been very hesitant to visit this movie because of how many kids movies I've seen in the recent years that have been incredibly bland and boring and basic and I can very happily say that this isn't the case for this movie. Also it's very refreshing for the lego franchise to use all of the different models to include other franchises in their own way instead of just referencing other franchises.This film is absolutely jam packed with very creative and colorful action. The set design is really well suited for animation and the animators did a great job bringing everything into a beautiful visual wonder. The things they do with water and smoke and how they use the lego format is just really fun to watch.The jokes are often funny but don't hit every time, mostly things like the jokes with a certain reincorporated side character got tired but not annoying.The overall meaning behind the film is also very sentimental and I like the way they tackle concepts in a way an adult can interpret and also enjoy.Really great family movie, and very enjoyable for pretty much any age.High 8/10.","

"DarkVulcan29","23 February 2014","A fun animated film with a simple title The Lego Movie. Makes you feel like you playing Lego's also, for adults who loved Lego's, it will make them feel like a kid again. The actors voices are perfect, I had a feel that they all had a blast working on this. The plot for the most part is like a parody of those Matrix films, but they use a lot of famous characters from other stuff also. It's not a total parody, there are moments that are pretty tender.So don't go in this movie expecting a lot, just go in and relax and have a wonderful time, at this awesome animated film. That will probably win an award for best animation or not. But still just have fun.","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","22 February 2014","Whatever stigma exists about movies based on toys both in general and in your mind, ""The LEGO Movie"" will dismantle it — brick by glorious brick. The writer/director combo of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,"" ""21 Jump Street"") prove themselves yet again as masterful comic storytellers with an endless stream of wit and imagination, turning a movie adults were quick to dismiss into one they will be overjoyed to watch with or without children.The world of ""The LEGO Movie"" is made entirely of LEGO pieces and though it was created using digital animation, contains the photorealism of stop-motion films, which is the first of many spot-on artistic choices Lord and Miller make. Even water, smoke and explosions are all made of bricks. So the way the film looks and operates remains unpredictable throughout the film, keeping the visuals engaging from start to finish.In terms of the story, Lord and Miller (along with Dan and Kevin Hageman) follow the instructions as far as family films go, but there are plenty of twists and the film's message is both unique and true to the experience of those who love LEGO. Emmet (Chris Pratt), a LEGO construction worker living in Bricksburg, where everything is awesome (as the city's number one hit song goes) because everyone follows the instructions, conforms, works together and is happy all the time. Turns out that's because Lord/President Business (Will Ferrell) wants it that way. Many years before, he stole a weapon called the Kragle from the master builder Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and now he plans to use it as a doomsday device, as it will stick pieces together and keep everything as it should be. When Emmet comes upon the Piece of Resistance, the one thing that can stop the Kragle, he starts to fulfill a prophecy, and with a team of LEGO friends, tries to stop Lord Business.All eras and styles of LEGO get some spotlight as the adventure grows in scope and imagination. There's the highly skilled action heroine, Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), her boyfriend, Batman (Will Arnett), Benny the '80s spaceman (Charlie Day), Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) and a host of other cameos from the DC Comics universe, ""Harry Potter,"" ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" and more. References to Octan, the brand featured on many LEGO products of old, proves just how aware Lord and Miller are of their audience.But it's the brilliance and hilarity of Emmet that makes ""The LEGO Movie"" work so well in terms of the story. The childlike wonder that launched Pratt's career on ""Parks and Recreation"" plays perfectly into the movie's humor. He's a constant laugh reel and a strong main character; his ineptitude is the butt of the other characters' jokes, making him the unlikely hero who has to prove everyone wrong.Perhaps not so coincidentally, Ferrell is also perfect casting as the dastardly President Business. Both he and Pratt have that man-child silliness in their comedy, and let's face it — LEGO fans are quite often man-children. This is something the film never loses sight of, as an unusual reveal late into the film puts LEGO within a context that its fans will truly appreciate.The reason the Danish building blocks have been around so long is their ability to capture imagination, and that's the primary thing ""The LEGO Movie"" does so well. The characters are constantly building new eye-popping creations to problem-solve their way through the conflict. Although the film is hilarious, so much of the humor comes from its creativity. There are even clever uses of non-LEGO items that play major roles throughout the film. Audiences who fell in love with Disney's ""Wreck-It Ralph,"" which takes place in the world of video games, will find ""The LEGO Movie"" to be a kindred spirit. So many different styles and genres converge in a diverse cinematic landscape fueled by the endless creative minds of animators and filmmakers. Both also take time to build emotion connections, not just creative worlds. ""The LEGO Movie"" will really speak to people who have spent countless hours building with LEGO, but its message will resonate with all ages and LEGO ""experience"" levels. In other words, Lord, Miller, the Hagemans and the entire creative team have dug down to find what makes LEGO a universally beloved brand and brought out the best of it in a wildly funny, creative and meaningful story.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"bombersflyup","23 April 2019","The Lego Movie works as a premise, with quality dialogue and visuals, but doesn't go anywhere story-wise and overstays its welcome in the third act.A star-studded ensemble, the standouts being Pratt as Emmett, Banks as Lucy and especially Arnett as Batman. With many good moments, though targeting a younger audience than myself unfortunately. I find a lot of it to hold true of the real world, people having the same opinion of no opinion and doing and liking what everyone else does. Which I simply cannot abide.Superman: I super hate you.","

"planktonrules","9 March 2014","A recent hit has been ""The Lego Movie"" and so far it's made a ton of money ($224,000,000 in only a month--and that's only in the USA!). Well, I don't find this the least bit surprising. The film already has a nostalgic element that might draw many adults to the movie. Additionally it has something many kids' films don't--it's very, very watchable for the adults who have been drug along to see it! It's often very funny and never takes itself seriously.The film is about a meanie in the Lego world named President Business (the voice of Will Ferrell). He's determined to destroy their world by using his ultimate weapon--a tube of Crazy Glue! But the inhabitants of the world are mostly clueless and think he's a great guy. Later, this turns out to have parallels in the real human world.As I said above, the film often was very funny as it often made nice cultural references or made fun of Lego. It also had the silliest soundtrack I've ever heard--with songs whose lyrics almost sound as if they were written by 7 year-olds! And, interestingly, you'll find yourself humming along with these catchy tunes! Clever and worth seeing, my only worry is that they'll bring out some sort of sequel--and although I really liked the film, I'd hate to see them ruin the franchise as the film seemed very complete and doesn't need followups.","

"Sahl_95","2 March 2014","One of the first must watch movies of 2014.Way better than I though it could be. A lot of funny scenes that will keep all ages entertained. Although a couple of scenes felt longer, that is simple due to how fast and funny the other scenes are.The animation and voice work are both brilliant. Will Arnett is great as Batman, and Liam Neeson as BadCop/GoodCop was just epic. Also Charlie Day as Benny was brilliant and is the star of one of my favourite scenes in the movie (you'll know it when you see it). The rest of the cast are fantastic as well.Lots of awesome cameos, including some unexpected (but still as awesome) ones.The plot is simple, but that doesn't mean the movie is any less entertaining.One of my favourite movies of all time and is still enjoyable on multiple viewings.","

"Arglebarglemorblewhoosh","23 February 2014","Lots of good visuals and plot in this film, but the idea that mediocrity is greatness and that the world can be magically changed just by wishing it were so is just so inaccurate and inane. This film tries to manufacture emotional depth without actually having any - kind of an example of the main problem, which is that just by wishing they made a movie with real meaning it could be so. Toy Story and Up and so many other movies actually HAVE emotional depth and real feeling, and the contrast highlights that this facsimile is using pure manipulation. And kids know the difference - my ten year old daughter left shaking her head at the end and wondering what had gone wrong and why we didn't just go see Frozen again, which would have been a better idea.","

"filmfanperspective","5 May 2015","It is likely that at some point you have put together a LEGO set, or at least sat in a doctor's office as a child and fiddled with ""Duplo"" blocks. The innovate building toy has been around for over 60 years in various incarnations, and over time has become ingrained in our culture- so much so that the licensed lines are commonplace. With licensing came comics, innovative and fun video games, and alas, short and full-length films. A feature-length film is really a culmination of years of success coming to a head. While not an entirely empty excuse to rake in more cash, ""The LEGO Movie"" falls short. At best it brings forth a few guffaws, and at worst it's pun overkill, forced emotion, and boredom.Please, allow me to 'build' my case 'brick by brick' (see, I can do pun humor too!). Until the first ""LEGO Star Wars"" video game arrived in 2004, I was blasé about the brand. The gameplay was immensely enjoyable, and the cut scenes interspersed between levels were light and humorous. Additional ""LEGO"" games were made, each seemingly more unique than the previous one. This led to the creation of short films, beginning in the ""Star Wars"" universe, and they've been excellent- made with the right balance of pun humor and quirky fun for adults and children. Like any good farcical comedy, the creators turned the subject on its' head, poking fun at the material whilst revering it. The entire LEGO media experience has been rewarding for myself and my child until now. Everything was awesome (see the film to understand that statement).Keeping that in mind, you'd think it would be a drop in the bag that I'd enjoy this immensely, but that's not the case. I can't help but compare ""The LEGO Movie"" to everything else the company has put out thus far, and in comparison, it doesn't hold up. The story is pretty straightforward- Emmet (Pratt) is a 'regular guy' who literally falls into an interesting situation. Adventurous Wyldstyle/Lucy (Banks) sees him as the 'special'- the one meant to overthrow malicious ""Lord Business"" (Ferrell) and keep him from permanently gluing everything together. Of course, that's just the WORST for LEGO figures, as they love to build. There's also a blind shaman/wizard (Freeman) guiding Emmet, and somehow he teams with Batman (Arnett) and a host of other random mini-figures (including Han Solo and crew?) to stop the 'lord' from doing his 'business'. See what I did there again?None of this is silly through the eyes of a child, however. The viewing I saw was chock full of cheering little ones. The frenetic nature of the film may be a big draw to those kids, but it just wore me out, to the point of restlessness. Maybe it had something to do with the 'stop-motion' style of animation. Maybe it was just the hyperactivity of the plot, or the way that certain characters spoke. Maybe I'm getting old enough that these kinds of things finally hit me, and I've turned the corner. It would be easier if I could say the film was dull, that I didn't laugh at all, or that it was an empty enterprise.None of that is true, and one can tell the care the creators put into the film. Consider this- most animated films of later years have done their best to make the film enjoyable for kids and adults alike, and thus its made for everyone. That's a benefit to everyone- the audience doesn't have to fake it and snore through 90 minutes, and the kids actually remember it afterwards.""The LEGO Movie"" may have been aiming to please everyone, but what made LEGO media work before is missing here. Tack on a confusing, sappy real-life scene at the end between father and son and it shifted into overkill for this reviewer. It performed so well that we can expect a sequel. My suggestion? Hire those responsible for the earlier fare, and recapture the original spirit that didn't need such clamor to work.","

"Falcon67","17 February 2014","This movie was OK, but not great. Not too keen on Will Ferrel or Morgan Freemam. The move was doing pretty good until they added the human part to it near the end which made it go from a very good movie to just an OK movie. The human part basically explained what was going on in the movie, a spoiled brat that didn't like being told what to do or respecting the privacy of others. Even with the stop action filming it was pretty good but would have been much better with computer animation like the other Lego movies. I suggest that the next time a Lego movie is made that it be kept purely Lego without adding the human elements to the movie like they did this one. Also don't portray the trouble maker(s) as the good guy(s).","

Sure, it sounds like a cash grab, but I definitely was hoping it would be something special, although I never really thought it would be. Then the reviews came, and my expectations were high. All in all, this is a wildly glorious ride. The thrill are non-stop, the dialogue is endlessly funny and witty, the animation wonderful. The voice performances are also really, each of these actors providing something different to their voices and making such a great ensemble of characters. I hope the sequel can bring as much fun as this.","

Going places letting your mind fly, not setting up barriers. At least that's how it feels to me. And the movie makes a point of it.While the movie is going on there is one big twist that will either shock you entirely (like myself) or you have read about it and it won't be as shocking as it could be. It doesn't make the movie less good. Try to watch it as open minded as you can and enjoy the jokes (some taken from movies) and feel your inner kid enjoying himself again ... no matter your age","

"Irishchatter","3 July 2015","I always loved Lego since I was a child and I even dreamt about going to legoland for a holiday which didn't happen lol.Anyways I didn't find the movie creative or exciting, it was just too obvious for me like I always knew what happened next in each scene. Believe me, I knew well Emmet was gonna get the girl he found on a construction site at the very end. It was badly done also. For example, like the old man Vitruvius in his ghost form, you can see his mouth wasn't moving or you can see the string that helps him to move as if he's flying! Well done Warner Brothers, that was an epic fail especially on a Lego based movie for god sakes!I didn't think Will Ferrell does a good job at playing as a bad guy, he sounded too much of a good guy. I mean he normally does a really good job at acting but he kinda disappointed me with this film to be honest.Also Batman shouldn't have dated Lucy at all, they didn't look to be a couple at the first place.","

"rooak","10 January 2015","If you want either a primer into the experience of having ADHD or an endless advertisement for Lego toys, then this unmitigated piece of rubbish is for you.From the opening onwards it is a series of visual and audio assaults on the viewer, with one demolition scene after another. It all felt the same after about fifteen minutes. Boringly the same.Lots of reviewers have commented that it was very funny, but whatever humour was in it bypassed me. I barely smiled at anything in it. And I'm not normally the curmudgeon in the crowd.Perhaps the nadir came when the human characters were introduced. Just in case we didn't quite get the heavy-handed messaging, we needed real humans to show us what it really looks like. And the message was simply philosophical romanticism married to pop psychology. Pleeeeaaaase can children be fed with something more helpful, if they have to be given these ""moral lessons."" If this movie was meant to recapture the pleasure of playing with Lego as a child, it didn't do it for me.Three out of ten only because I've got to leave room for other even more dreadful flicks. One of which is most likely going to be Lego Movie 2 scheduled for 2018. Ugghhh...","

"thegreatape","9 February 2014","My 5 and 6 year old kids loved this film - at least they think they did. The colours and flashing images of good old Lego were enough to convince them that it had been a wonderful experience but I remain unconvinced.I have two main gripes with this movie: 1) Is it really necessary to have almost every scene with a thousand characters on the screen and the action flying by so fast that it just becomes a wash of gaudy colour and feels like being on a roller-coaster? There is simply too much happening on screen and they have tried to pack far too much into the movie. The result is an absolute mess whenever the action picks up beyond walking pace. Pieces are flying about and changing at such speed that it is impossible to take it in. I heard that the animators put 52-years' of combined hours into the film, which means that I assume the work is amazing. If only it had been moving at a speed where it could be appreciated. I would have loved to have seen the beautiful and clever work they did, instead it just felt like they had 4 hours of construction ideas and 90 minutes to squash them in to.2) Does Lego really know it's audience? The basis of the film is Lego City, which is aimed at 6 to 12 year olds. However, Lego must know that most boys and girls stop playing with Duplo at about 5 and their interest in Lego as a fascination (ie. something they would want to see a movie about) rather than an occasional plaything wanes at about 8. The entire cinema was full of kids aged below 9, that much is for sure; and yet the story itself is too complex for that age group. Sure, my children felt that enjoyed the film, simply because they are wild about Lego, but when I asked them comprehension questions afterwards, they had no idea at all what the deeper storyline was or of the moral contained therein. They certainly were not able to comprehend the switch between the Lego world and Will Ferrell and his son in the basement. That may have been the stand-out theatrical switch for adults and older children viewing, but it was totally lost on my children and every other uner-8 who filled the cinema. Sure, they left saying ""Emmet was cool"" but they could not understand in a month of Sundays that Emmet and Finn were one and the same person.I'm sure people will rave about this movie and it will be a huge success in spite of the fact that it is actually poorly thought out and was a real missed opportunity to create something beautiful. It seems that Lego can simply do no wrong but they should certainly stick to making blocks instead of films. However, I seem to be in a minority in thinking this film was a wasted opportunity to make something slower and more thoughtful than the hotchpotch of ideas it was. And that is what the real beauty of Lego is, not that it has infinite possibilities but that it is one of the few things that parents can still do with their children at a thoughtful and slow pace. My son has dozens of toys that are all about making noise and running about at a hundred miles an hour. When we play Lego together we sit and chat quietly and build beautiful things at a relaxed pace which enhances the quality of the time we spent together. It just seemed to me that the makers of the film have totally missed who their audience really are and also missed why parents keep turning to Lego as a great toy for their kids. It is not the action we want, it is the quality time.","

"coljam21","15 February 2014","I don't understand the high ratings this film is getting. Sure I loved Legos as a kid but the movie was horrible. It was jumpy and erratic and didn't make any sense. Sure it had a good message; that you should always be yourself and not fit the societal mold, but besides that it was pretty much unbearable. I didn't laugh not once though out the entire film and my kids didn't know any better. As if that wasn't bad enough, they had to mix the Lego block figurines with humans and Will Farrel made an appearance. I usually really enjoy the kiddie movies when I take my kids but this I must say is the worst I have experienced thus far. I gave it one star and another for the positive message.","

"mgruebel","15 October 2015","""The LEGO Movie"" is a children's film in the category of toys that come to life, and may interact with their owners. Such films include the H. C. Andersen ""Brave Tin Soldier"" segment from Fantasia 2000, accompanied by Shostakhovich's 2nd piano concerto, or Pixar's classic ""Toy Story."" How does ""LEGO"" stack up (pun intended) against ""Toy Story""? I gave the latter an 8/10, and I would say ""The LEGO Movie"" is at least 2 notches down. 6/10.Of course the best part is the LEGO landscapes. The director intermingles plenty of product lines, from Star Wars to Pirates to Duplo to Cityscape. It all would have been really impressive if it had been done with real blocks by stopped motion animation, like some of the fan shorts. Alas, it's just CGI, but at least they stuck to LEGO brick rules all the way through, as far as I could tell.The story is humdrum: an evil and not-so-special LEGO figure wants to glue everything together with superglue. In the real world, dad wants to do the same with his big basement LEGO project, so his son can't mess it up. To the rescue comes an ordinary LEGO worker figure who shows that anyone can be ""special,"" and convinces the evil mastermind to stand down. A bit of pop culture reference is thrown in here or there, a bit of satire now and then, but none of it rises above the level of a 14 year-old bionicle user who may be watching, never mind a grizzled old moviegoer who wants to see something new.So the movie is what it is: harmless, fluffy kid's fare, lacking the charm of stop-motion animation LEGO shorts, with a ""theme song"" that runs out of melody and lyrics in about 10 seconds. It's sure to spawn sequels to please the 6-10 year old crowd. And it should, they could be watching worse.The biggest irony: the only novel idea in the film was the double-decker couch!","

It was a nice change of pace from the dramas we've been watching lately as this one is mostly animated Legos with voices from various celebrities like Morgan Freeman and Will Ferrell. Since Warner Bros. is the distributor, it shouldn't be a surprise that characters owned by them like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are depicted here though we shouldn't take them for the real thing since they're Lego-based ones. To tell the truth, I didn't find the whole thing hilarious but I was pretty amused throughout and the constant motion of the characters and many moving backgrounds was enough to entertain me and my friend. In summary, I liked The Lego Movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in this sort of thing.","

Because if the LEGO movie doesn't make you chuckle at least once in the hundred minutes of on screen time then I cannot say I know what will. The fresh faced witty humour of the characters was refreshing and led to shrieks of amusement from the prepubescent's that filled the cinema and the belly laughed guffaws of parents alike. Unlike many children's films to date, the film featured none of the thinly veiled innuendos and stereotypes (commonplace in Disney films). Deviating from the norm, the 'hero' of the story (subject to personal opinion) was unaware and unprepared to fulfil his role and in actual fact, one of the main lessons to be derived from the film is that anyone has the ability to be someone special as long as they believe in their own ability to do so. Instead of portraying heroism as something designed for the 'elite' and privileged few who have been 'destined' for greatness since birth, the recurring theme within the movie is that anyone can be a hero.Full review http://thatgirlreadallaboutit.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/the- lego-movie_24.html","

"walkereweaver-42355","21 February 2020","The LEGO movie does an excellent job of portraying how LEGO toys are used. You have people like Finn's dad who collect LEGO sets and have to follow the instructions perfectly, and are very serious about it. Then you have people like Finn who like to build their own things and don't follow the instructions. Master Builder is a term that is actually used by LEGO and it refers to people who make all of the instructions for the company's toys. Being captured by Lord Business is a metaphor for LEGO hiring people who grew up loving LEGO and then being taken in to the company. Lord Business represents a consumer/collector that always wants more sets to add to their collection. I think this was a very bold movie for LEGO to make, because it questions both the company and the community itself. I truly love this movie for so many reasons but mainly because it makes me appreciate what The LEGO Group has done.","

More over, this is a story from which almost everyone could learn something new. I really loved the way the heroes were chosen - it was like a bubbling mixture of superheroes, magicians and well-known cartoon heroes in general. Again this is a reminder that we can be much more than society tells us to be. This movie should be definitely watched on big screen because of many little details. Definite must see!","

"Anurag-Shetty","10 February 2014","The Lego Movie is a movie about, plainly speaking, Legos. When President Business(Will Ferell), threatens to glue the Lego universe together using an adhesive called Kragle, it is up to the 'MasterBuilder', Emmet Brickowoski(Chris Pratt) to stop him using the Piece of Resistance. Emmett is helped by other MasterBuilders like, Wyldstyle/Lucy(Elizabeth Banks), Batman(Will Arnett), Unikitty(Alison Brie), Benny(Charlie Day), Abraham Lincoln(Will Forte), Wally(Dave Franco), the all-knowing Vitrivius(Morgan Freeman), Superman(Channing Tatum), Wonder Woman(Cobie Smulders), Green Lantern(Jonah Hill), Barry(Jake Johnson), Shaq(Shaquille O'Neal), Metal Beard(Nick Offerman) & Shakespeare(Jorma Taccone). The only problem is, Emmett has never had an original idea throughout his life. Also, standing in the MasterBuilders' way is President Business, Bad Cop/Good Cop(Liam Neeson) & the president's various robotic lackeys. The Lego Movie is mind numbingly outstanding! The animation is first rate, considering that all the characters & the environment in the movie look like Lego figurines & Lego building blocks. Phil Lord & Chris Miller have proved their directorial skills, once again. The duo's directing skills vary from animated movies like Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs & The Lego Movie to hilarious adult comedies like 21 Jump Street(can't wait for the upcoming sequel, 22 Jump Street). The voice acting is exceptional, with an all-star voice cast. Chris Pratt is brilliant as the protagonist, Emmett Brickowoski. Will Arnett is hysterical as the Lego version of Batman. Elizabeth Banks is great as Wyldstyle/Lucy. Alison Brie is adorable as Unikitty. Charlie Day is eccentric & hilarious as 1980s something space guy, Benny. Will Ferell is diabolical & menacing as President Business. Will Forte is impressive as Abraham Lincoln. Dave Franco is effective as Wally. Morgan Freeman is mind blowing as the wise elder, Vitrivius. Todd Hansen is great as Gandalf. Channing Tatum is outstanding as Superman. Cobie Smulders is good as Wonder Woman. Jonah Hill is spectacular as Green Lantern. I would have liked to see more interaction between Superman & Batman since we have to wait till 2016 for the Batman/Superman crossover film. Jake Johnson is effective as Barry. Liam Neeson shines in his varied portrayal of Bad Cop/Good Cop/Pa Cop. Shaquille O'Neal is effective as Shaq. Nick Offerman is ovation-worthy as pirate, Metal Beard. Anthony Daniels, Keith Ferguson & Billy Dee Williams are great as Star Wars veterans, C-3PO, Han Solo & Lando respectively. The supporting characters are effective as well. The soundtrack is foot-tapping & catchy at the same time. I would like to conclude by saying, The Lego Movie is a must watch & will go down in history as one of the classics, animated or otherwise.","

"areatw","17 August 2017","'The LEGO Movie' brings LEGO to life in a lively, action packed film. On paper, this movie really shouldn't have worked. Taking a popular kids' toy and making a movie out of it was a big risk and was never going to please everyone. Part of the reason it turned out so well is because it doesn't even take itself seriously. LEGO itself is the butt of many of the jokes in the film.The story is better than expected and the characters are funny and interesting. Visually this film is spectacular. The amount of detail in each frame is mind-blowing. It's amazing to watch. I would have never expected a film based on a toy to be such a hit, and not only with kids. 'The LEGO Movie' is about as good as I could have hoped it to be. If you think about the many things that could have gone wrong with this movie, it's impressive how well it was received.","

"neil-476","21 February 2014","First of all, they are not Legos, they are Lego bricks. The word Lego never has an s after it. OK, onwards and upwards.Lego construction worker Emmett is a forgettable everyman: surprisingly, he turns out to be The Special, fated to lead a resistance movement to save the Lego world against the evil plan of Lord Business by using the Piece of resistance to prevent the use of the Kragle to destroy everything.Let me say at the start, that this film is fun. It references pretty nearly everything I enjoy, takes potshots at all sorts, and works well as a bright, colourful kids' fantasy but with enough nods, winks and knowing gags to satisfy your average adult (just look at some of the voice credits - Anthony Daniels delivers one line as a Lego C3PO, for instance). The voice talent in general is great, and I particularly enjoyed Liam Neeson's willingness to send himself up.Having been positive overall, it seems a little ill-natured to be critical, but I must mention two things which didn't sit that well with me. One was that, for a film which needed to be simple, it got awfully complicated at times, and the other was that the animation style and the sheer quantity of what was happening meant that, at times, I really couldn't follow what was going on in front of me.But I repeat - this film is fun, and worth watching on that basis alone.","

"Leopold005","10 April 2014","I've stated that this contains spoilers, but I'll do my best not to make them too spoiler-y!I saw the trailer for the Lego Movie a couple of months ago and it looked like it might be pretty good - a nice blend of humour, action and nostalgia. I eventually convinced one of my kids to come and see it with me, so off we went.My first impression was that they'd done what I hoped they wouldn't do: They'd burned almost all of the best lines in the trailer. I hate it when that happens. That said, there was still some nicely crafted humour in there (mostly aimed at adults), but it was all a bit manic and a little hard for me to keep up with. But it was all still reasonably enjoyable, right up until the de facto ""Hollywood Morality Syrup"" got poured all over it, at which point it went all sugary and spoiled it a bit for me. I should stress, I'm not averse to a bit of sentimentality, but this film really didn't need to be drowned in it. As a father, all it did was make me feel guilty, even though none of my kids even showed the slightest inkling to play with Lego, meaning I never needed the threat of Kragle. Or Supgle, as I suspect we'd call it here in the UK.It's by no means a bad film, but having my expectations raised by the trailer left me feeling a bit let down by it.","

"Buddy-51","3 August 2014","The cheerfully dystopic ""The Lego Movie"" is like a family-friendly version of ""A Brave New World,"" with a little bit of ""The Matrix"" thrown in for good measureEmmet Brickowski is a rule-following, law-abiding ""good citizen,"" just like all the other countless conformist drones who make up the futuristic society in which he lives. Only Emmet is even more average than the average Average Joe, as evidenced by the fact that even the people he works with aren't really sure who he is. In true dystopic fashion, he lives in a society that demands unthinking and unquestioning obedience to the status quo, making it easier for those in positions of authority - particularly the arch-villain Lord Business - to accrue ever more power without any pesky resistance from the effectively pacified unwashed masses. Until, that is, Emmet is informed that, unlikely as it may seem, he just may be the long-awaited Messianic figure, know as The Master Builder, whom, it has been prophesied, will one day appear on the scene to mount a revolt against the tyrannical system and lead his fellow citizens to freedom.Even though he's essentially an animated Lego figure, Emmet turns out to be the single most endearing everyman hero we've been asked to fall in line behind in quite some time. And the always under-appreciated Chris Pratt (""Everwood,"" ""Parks and Recreation,"" ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") deserves much of the credit for that. So, too, do the writers, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who co-directed the film as well.To add to the spirit of anarchic fun, a host of historical and pop culture figures, from Lincoln and Shakespeare to Superman and Batman to the casts of ""Harry Potter"" and ""Star Wars,"" make cameo appearances in the film.There's also a parallel story that takes place in the ""real world"" that underlines the part imagination and role-playing have in bringing people together.Imaginative plotting, first-rate animation and sharp, snappy writing - backed by outstanding voice work by Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Nick Offerman, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman - instantly place ""The Lego Movie"" in the pantheon of great computer- animated films.","

Nearly took a snooze. When we asked the girls how they liked it (god forbid we be allowed to sit with them during the movie), they all said ""ehhh"" with a shoulder shrug. Understanding which celebrities provided the voices made it more interesting for ""the adults"" and the animation was spectacular. After conferring with my husband, we agree that it's a standard, well animated kids movie much like the million others we've been subjected to in the past 10 years.

"Likes_Ninjas90","2 April 2014","One of the safest ways in which Hollywood preserves its bankability is not by investing in new ideas but by creating relationships between the on screen images and tangible commodities like toys. Toys have become the target of Hollywood because they have the incentive of drawing in younger audiences, along with their parents, as they recognise the items or images on the screen. Transformers, Battleship and G.I. Joe are some of the toys that have been made into huge blockbusters but the ploy is older than that. Cinema merchandising can be traced back to the early blockbuster films of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas in the mid Seventies. Video games have also been adapted into films for two decades because there is already an established fanbase and are deemed safer and more profitable than developing new ideas. Comic book films and action movies are becoming gradually imitative of the physics and design of video games, particularly in their elaborate action sequences. It is now a question as to whether cinema, particularly among young viewers, will ever be given the imagination and originality that it deserves, instead of relying on existing products for inspiration. Similarly, do films adapting toys remove children from the joys of having a tangible object or toy in their hands and encouraging them to develop their own imagination? The transition from toys to films belongs to a broader timeline and capitalist trajectory. The Lego Group was established by Ole Kirk Christianen, a Danish carpenter who started making wooden children's toys in the early 1930s because he had lost his job in the Great Depression. The name Lego is taken from the Dutch phrase ""leg godt"" which means ""play well"". Lego has developed from simple wooden designs to plastic materials and now into a sixty million dollar blockbuster. While this computer generated feature from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) is indisputably made to sell more of Christianen's toys, it's relieving to say that it brims with visual charm and creativity. Cleverly, the film has been shot using regular CGI animation, courtesy of the Australian animation studio Animal Logic, but it has been made to look as though it has a stop motion aesthetic. Stop motion animation is time consuming because it relies on photographing an image or model, adjusting it and photographing it again. There have been Lego stop motion videos on sites such as Youtube that have used this process, which is where this film takes inspiration for its design. Along with using CGI, the little Lego figures were also examined to see how they look, feel and move and then incorporated into the film. Aside from the forgettable 3D, it is a film that is simply drowning in clever visual details and sight gags. This is where the film generates a lot of its charm, humour and nostalgia. It's great fun to see those Lego figures back from your childhood, but with even more personality and expression, along with some of the classic old sets, like the Western world. However, the greatest challenge for any film based on a toy, let alone one playing with Lego, is what to do with the narrative. The film's script by the directors is very funny at times and witty, particularly with the way that it employs gentle nudges and self-depreciating humour towards pop culture icons like Lego Batman and Green Lantern. Yet the narrative leaves a lot to be desired. The plot is thin, relying heavily on standard MacGuffin devices and pleasant liberal messages about finding your personal gifts and using your imagination when the rest of the world is conforming. It's sweet but hardly testing and it's also padded extensively by action scenes that are only different from the ones they're parodying because they're in Lego form. At least the voice cast (Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson among others are delightful) is highly colourful and distinctive and each character has their own moment of personal glory. I would have liked a few more of these character moments to put the film on a level closer to a Pixar film but small children are still going to love the visual spark alone. It moves faster than your old Lego set and without the pain of collecting any of the tiny pieces left behind. Despite its good intentions and its positive messages, do people want to see their children being told they can be imaginative while watching a film or discovering that same creativity as they build and craft Lego worlds for themselves?","

While the game has its characters and its sets, it's goofy story and surprise characters seem very much like the creation of a child unbound by concepts of what is right and wrong in storytelling.At the same time, the story holds together in a way a kid's story wouldn't. For all its craziness, it's very well thought out.Most of the way through this movie I would have given it 8 stars, but the final sequences are so utterly brilliant and unexpected that I had to give it 9.","

I did actually enjoy the Lego format though. It brought back memories of when I was little and I used to love building with Lego...I mean who didn't. I still can't help myself if I have a pile in front of me. All the old references were classic and what made it fun.While the characters were a little one-dimensional they were lovable. I cared about them enough to keep me engaged in the movie, especially Emmet. The cameos and different Lego lands were also cool and turned it into a proper motion picture instead of a TV movie. So not my favourite movie of all time but it was a good movie.","

"KineticSeoul","20 May 2014","I know some people that compare this movie to Wreck-It Ralph. Personally I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did for Wreck-It Ralph, but that isn't to say this movie wasn't entertaining. It's a creative movie with Lego pieces, quick, snappy and sometimes witty dialogues mixed in with pop-culture references. When it comes to the plot, it's actually quite simple but the journey makes this movie worthwhile. All the voice actors and actresses that actually have a name in the movie industry did a really good job. Like Wreck-It Ralph I liked how certain iconic characters gets thrown into the mix as well. And for the most part it connects well with the story. The climax part of this movie also elevated the score for this movie to 7.9/10 for me. Oh and I also liked the message behind this flick as well, which probably would have benefited me if I saw this movie during my childhood.7.9/10","

My wife and I took our five and three year olds to this movie, and I think we had more fun with it than they did.That's actually not very surprising, since the Lego franchise is defined by sarcastic humor full of pop culture references, many of them references to the pop culture of my own childhood rather than that of the present. ""The Lego Movie"" is fast, fun and colorful, and is capped with a surprise twist that had almost as much of an emotional impact on me as the ending of ""Toy Story 3"" did, and in the same way.My favorite moment is the appearance of the Millennium Falcon, and the alternate version of what happens to it when it's trying to escape the giant space slug in the asteroid field. If you don't see why that's funny, then you're just not going to like this movie, and I will feel sorry for you.Grade: A","

"moviexclusive","8 February 2014","If there was a postage system that can send letters to the past, this writer would pen a letter to his younger self - say, to the primary school kid he knew 25 years ago. And this is how the letter would read.Dear John (from the past),This is your future self writing to you. It's the year 2014 and much has changed. The Internet is amazingly fast, and almost everyone I see on the street is busy looking at some sort of electronic gadget. Most importantly, I have seen The Lego Movie, and this is the reason why I feel the need to tell you about it.The 100 minute directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller is one you had dreamed of ever since you owned your first Lego construction set. That toy wasn't an elaborate castle of city set, but it sure brought you endless wondrous hours of imaginative fun. The police car (and the minifigure that comes with it) was a reward for your spelling test, and boy, was it a reward well earned.Ever since then, you'd imagine an entire movie starring Lego minifigures, embarking on adventures in the different Lego backdrops. I have seen that movies 30 years on, and here are five reasons why I think you should look forward to it every single day of your life – till you're 33.Reason 1: The movie is a fine example of good ol' storytelling. The protagonist is an ordinary Lego minifigure (yup, one of those yellow faced common folks you'd lose if you had a humongous city set) who mistakenly gets recruited to stop an evil tyrant from destroying the Lego universe. The story by Dan Hageman, Kevin Hageman, and the two directors is encouraging, inspiring and a feel good tale about how every individual has the potential to go a long way. Trust me, you may hear a lot about this in school now, but some 20 years on, the cynicism of the world will get to you. The plot of this movie, however, will steer you in the right direction to do good things about your life.Reason 2: The movie is hilariously clever. The jokes are fast and furious, and while you may not understand the puns spouted by the minifigures now (if the movie was playing in 1989), it would make your teacher chuckle. Clever references to pop culture and the Lego brand are aplenty, and it is one movie you'd want to revisit repeatedly.Reason 3: The movie is a technical achievement. I'm not sure whether you're familiar with the concept of stop motion, but go ask your teacher and you will be amazed by the amount of work needed to produce a stop motion clip. This movie infuses computer technology (I won't go into details of how scarily advanced this has become in 2014) with stop motion and the end result is an enjoyable visual treat.Reason 4: The movie is chockfull of cameo appearances. As the years go by, you'd hear how everyone wants to see Superman and Batman in the same movie. This animated feature is the first to make that happen. On top of that, other well known characters appear as well. The names probably won't make sense to you now, but when you grow older, you'll understand why certain wizards from a popular movie franchise are a big deal. Oh, there are also characters from a certain galaxy far, far away; and a fellow yellow faced personality who make this movie a must watch for all nerds and geeks (I meant that in a cool way, of course).Reason 5: The movie has got heart, lots of it. Some movies may be too obsessed with showing off its technical prowess, and forget about how it touches the human soul. This one is different. The revelation is one affecting turn of events, and trust me, it's one of the most relevant and heartfelt plots you'd ever see. Before signing off, my advice to you is to hang on to that Lego police car set, continue to let your imagination take you to places, and all things will be good.Yours sincerely,John (from the future)","

"tomgillespie2002","19 June 2014","For anyone who spent a lot of their childhood banging lumps of plastic together, creating outlandish plots and dialogue for them to act out, and pretending that all that lurked beyond the edges of the bed is a sea of molten lava, then you'll get The Lego Movie. It's hyperactive, fit- inducingly-colourful, and very, very funny, but it's the message behind the movie that makes it so wonderful. It tells a silly prophetic story about a simple construction worker thought to be 'the Special' - a plot deliberately made to sound like it's the product of an imaginative child - but his world of instructions manuals, mass consumerism, moronic pop songs and diabolical sitcoms is our world: the adult world. The Lego Movie makes you want to find your inner child again, and go back to those days where you could transport yourself to another world in your bedroom by using your own brain.Emmet (Chris Pratt) is a naive and simple everyman, routinely watching popular sitcom ""Where Are My Pants?"", singing along to ""Everything is Awesome!"", and using an instruction manual for every aspect of his life. Left behind on a construction site one night, he comes across the mysterious Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), who seems to be searching for something. After accidentally spooking her, he investigates himself, and comes across the 'Piece of Resistance', a glowing object that gives him visions and knocks him unconscious when he touches it. When he awakens, he's being interrogated by Bad Cop (Liam Neeson), and finds the Piece has attached itself to his back. Believing him to be 'the Special' from a prophecy, Wyldstyle rescues Emmet and takes him to the Gandalf-alike Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), who teaches Emmet the way to becoming a master builder.What could have been a mindless 90-minute advertisement for a global product, The Lego Movie dodges the bullet by actually attacking mass- consumerism, placing the importance on creativity and individuality. The big bad buy is Lord Business (Will Ferrell), a helmet-wearing, caped corporate devil who wishes to control everyone by gluing them in place with 'the Krakle' (a mispronunciation of Krazy Glue), oppressing the freedom to travel between Lego worlds (including The Old West, Middle- Zealand and Cloud Cuckoo Land). This is also a stab at collectors, those strange types who like to keep their toys in boxes and display them, rather than getting them out and using them for what they were designed for. Toys may have become ornaments, ways to make easy money on eBay.It could be argued that such satire has no place in a kids movie. But these are the same kids who now have their own iPhones, bombarded with in-game advertisements and growing up in a world of reality TV, with programmes consistently celebrating wealth, stupidity and branding. Wyldstyle, concerned that Emmet may have never had an original thought in his entire life, asks him what his favourite restaurant is. ""Any chain restaurant!"" he gleefully replies. This is the man who is supposed to save the world, the greatest master builder to have ever lived, only to be a master builder, you need to have an imagination to create something amazing out of nothing. The best that Emmet has come up at this point is a two-level couch. It maybe useless, illogical and absolutely pointless, but it's something.But The Lego Movie isn't all metaphors, it's also beautifully animated (it occasionally replicates stop-motion, as if the movie is actually made of Lego bricks, although it is entirely CGI), exceptionally witty, and features an outstanding vocal cast, who make up an entourage of Lego characters based on other mediums. We have Batman (Will Arnett) as Wyldstyle's arrogant yet lovable boyfriend, and the likes of Han Solo, C-3PO, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Gandalf, Dumbledore, Michelangelo the Renaissance artist and Michelangelo the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. It's an absolute joy, as if looking into a child's toy boy to find a bunch of random and unconnected figures from years of collecting. And that sums up the film - like looking into the past and realising that that same person, who could lose hours putting on silly voices and concocting ridiculous stories, is still in there somewhere.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","

"Samiam3","6 June 2017","The story involves the search for an object that can stop the 'Kragle'; a dangerous weapon threatening all of lego-mankind.With its mechanical meta awareness, franchise jokes, and a daring third act that shatters (not just breaks) the fourth wall, there is no question that the Lego Movie is clever. The problem is that the self mockery is too heavy. That and a jumbled story line, visually incoherent action scenes, and shallow emotional content make for a mediocre movie.Our protagonist is a modern version of the construction worker character from Lego's first packages. He is as amusingly mundane as the movie tells us he is, but remains mundane in those few moments when he is supposed to amount to something more. He goes from being a spoof on the hapless hero to being just another version of one.The most memorable piece of the movie is the ear worm song 'Everything is Awesome' which is as cheesy as it is addicting. Other highlights are Liam Neeson's Good Cop/Bad Cop, and a happy go lucky unicorn with a demonic alter ego lurking just under the happy face. Lego Batman has enough moments to have made him easily worthy of his own movie (which he now has). We also have all the other DC and Marvel heroes who are there just so the makers can check their names off the list.The ending takes us out of Legoland and into the three dimensional world. Here we get the punchline, the revelation of what exactly the 'Kragle' is. They has a cute idea, but it comes with notes of forced sentiment that fall rather flat.By focusing to much on mocking the gimmick of the toy, as well all the franchise characters, the movie itself ends up feeling like a gimmick. There is no heart, soul or narrative shape, and the scattered laughs don't make it worth the time.","

"byson5186","27 January 2015","I've seen this movie twice, one time I rented it from Redox and another time I watched it with my parents at home. I have to say, my nephews love this movie it is like their favorite movie. That's good for them that they liked it, but this movie didn't entertain me too much. I mean it had a good moral to the story, it had nice special effects but there were some things wrong with this movie.First off, I played with Lego's as a kid. I used to play Lego's with a couple of friends when I was a kid. I played with Legos up until I was like in 8th Grade. Rather then do the building I mostly just came up with my own stories with a friend and we would play with the Lego's with our own stories, having our own fictional worlds from our imaginations. Yeah, this is what the movie mostly looked like. It looked like an imaginative kids story. I mean there didn't seem to be much of a plot to it, I mean there is a plot but it does not seem like a memorable or good plot. The movie seems more about the special effects and Lego universe. Legos have been a popular kids toy for a very long time. They finally made a movie out of it. The movie also left us with a great message which might seem like a typical movie message for kids films, but still a great message. The characters in this movie seemed one dimensional. Now, that they finally came up with a Lego movie, it reminds me of a Lego game I played as a kid a couple of times called Lego Island. I didn't play that game that often, but it seemed to have more of a plot, and relatable world than this movie.So, I'll say that there are a couple of movies that you like, or people with your taste will like them, but they aren't very popular. An example of that, is like my favorite movie is Earth To Echo which I also left a review on, and about half the reviews for that movie are positive. Luckily, that movie didn't flop as it had a low budget but it didn't make a lot of money and I feel like it's way underrated. There are also movies you don't like that are very popular an example of that is a movie that was pretty popular especially 10 years ago with all this franchise and people quoting the movie, Napoleon Dynamite. I haven't seen that movie in a long time, and don't really care for it, or find it entertaining. But, so many other people thought of that slow pace movie as entertaining. Now, to share an example of a TV show, There was one TV show I loved which aired in 2009 called The Othersiders on Cartoon Network CN Real, but that show got cancelled after four months because of the low ratings, and you can find very little information about that show.I'm not here to talk about other movies or TV shows. But, to me The Lego Movie seems like too kiddish of a movie for me, like a film more so for the younger audience and not as much for the older audience because of the lack of plot and being a little cheesy making the Lego characters not seem realistic, but fictional and one dimensional. I'll give this movie a 4/10 because it was clever, it did have good effects and a message. It's incredible to think adults could imagine this, I mean my Dad thought it was incredible to think of people imagining this. But, if you have my taste then you're much better off watching a film like Earth To Echo. I wouldn't recommend this film, but I'd strongly recommend that film. I also will say that this movie would probably entertain most kids under 12.","

"johnnyboyz","17 April 2018","""The Lego Movie"" plays like a loud Sunday morning cartoon, but which just so happens to have the odd reference to an old movie or life situation an adult might be able to cotton on to thrown in for good measure. It is, like so many of those cartoons, an exhausting assault of colour; noise; movement and energy - experiencing it is, indeed, very much like sitting and watching two (or more) frenetic kids playing with a vast array of Lego paraphernalia - something which, it turns out, isn't too far away from what is actually happening anyway... Despite this, there is buried within ""The Lego Movie"" somewhere the message that there is no substitute for creativity and imagination, which is admirable enough, yet rather ironically the film needed to be reigned in much more for it all to work. The story is also incredibly conventional, in its depiction of heroes; villains; mentors and love interests battling away in a place where a plot to end the world has been hatched. This wasn't something you could say about something like ""Toy Story"", which decided to eschew some of these tropes; brought to life an alternate universe within our own and also depicted an impressive two-fold character study. Meanwhile, a better example of an animated post-modernist explosion which combined rapid pacing and cultural gentrification might be 2012's ""Wreck it Ralph"". American actor Chris Pratt voices Emmett, a lowly construction worker living in a city made entirely out of Lego that is run by President Business (Will Ferrell). Business is a crypto-fascist who controls the population with cheesy pop songs and awful television shows. It is, as Neil Postman once wrote, ""...in the age of advanced technology, spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face than from one whose countenance exudes suspicion and hate."" So slavish to this situation are the inhabitants of Emmett's world that everybody 'greets' the world each morning as one. Emmett is ripped out of his world of subconscious conformity when, one day after work, he spots an intruder on the construction site and, upon confronting them, accidentally winds up deep underground prior to experiencing an out-of-body experience which renders him unconscious. Before he knows anything, he is eye-deep in a plot to do with Business' private Gestapo and the foiling of a prophecy once made by Business' sworn enemy Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) to do with how, one day, a hero will lead the people to victory over the world of orthodoxy and order. Narrative is perfunctory for most of the film; that is until, perhaps cleverly, it wraps its story into what is REALLY happening beyond the confines of the film's universe. ""The Lego Movie"", for the most part, is too preoccupied with dragging you head first through a bush - then through another bush into the Wild West; then through another into a realm of knights and dragons before settling on something else entirely, but not before it has taken you to Cloud Cuckoo Land (don't ask) as Emmett and a collection of allies strive to defeat the bad guy. How one reacts to any of this will be dependent on one's tolerance threshold for sheer nonsense, but nonsense that is harmless fun and which does possess half a dozen genuine laughs (Vitruvius' secret knock, anyone?), while being helped along by the fact everything is made of Lego. Had it been something else other than Lego, such as 'regular' characters going about a 'regular' adventure, would anyone have really provided the film with much more than a passing grade? The makers of the film, Christopher Miller & Phil Lord, cover so much ground and flit from one to so many other places that they allow themselves licence to do anything and reference anything from any walk of life or genre. It isn't often you get Shaquille O'Neal joking about how the enemy were ""...ready for that(!)"" within minutes of Professor Dumbledore arguing with someone over the pronunciation of his name. This is actually fairly lazy, and is best epitomised when they take their characters to the aforementioned Cloud Cuckoo Land, which is, put literally, merely a locale of complete gibberish wherein anything goes. Rooted at the epicentre of the piece is a stiff, egalitarian message to do with how individualism and diversity must triumph over conformity and a refusal to accept amalgamation and hybridity, which is here depicted as pure evil. Again, how one reacts to the film will depend on your own outlooks in life - are pirates and soldiers best suited to battling one another on desert islands and across vast oceans? Or do they all need to come together with the astronauts; cowboys; spaceships; half the cast of ""Harry Potter"" and Robin Hood to have one giant adventure for any of it to be enjoyable.Despite this, the film occasionally branches off for more admirable messages to do with self-confidence and thinking for oneself - using your imagination and being creative, best demonstrated in Vitruvius' line to Emmett that he must ""embrace what is special about you."" But more tantalising is the fact there are so many objects from OUR world in the villain's possession. And why do we hear a human boy remark ""it's your turn to be the hero..."" as Emmett has his early out-of-body experience?By the time the film had ended the first time I saw it (I watched it twice), I had a headache. I was able to appreciate it a little more after the second viewing because I had a better idea of where the chaos was heading, but remain relatively dumb-founded as to why so much praise had been previously heaped on it. Many-a nice thing has been written and said about ""The Lego Movie"", but it struck me as generally a bit of a mess.","

"Vartiainen","19 September 2014","I must admit, I wasn't expecting much walking into this movie. I mean, it's a movie about Lego characters, with an actual Lego Batman and everything. How good could it honestly be? But, to my surprise, this movie made me remember just how much fun I used to have with Lego. The sheer imagination and endless possibilities involved were what made them so great and this movie showcases those aspects beautifully.It's also a good story in general and includes some really good twists. Admittedly the final reveal and ending can seem a bit bizarre, but I could stomach it without any major problems and many of my friends absolutely loved how out there it was.Furthermore, the voice acting is topnotch, the trademark characters are utilized well and with lots of humour and the original characters fit well with them without being overshadowed. But the greatest part of all this are the visuals. Everything has been built out of Lego blocks. Everything. And everything even has the Lego logo on it, every block. It's mindblowing how much detail they've managed to squeeze in and how painstakingly accurate they try to remain. Enormous extra points just for that.The Lego Movie is excellent movie for children and adults alike. Children will enjoy the characters and the visuals, while the adults can indulge in nostalgia and the surprisingly profound message.","

"badajoz-1","5 March 2014","A very refreshing and enjoyable film with lots of clever use of animation and humour for both young and old. But I am of the generation that never built Lego - only bought it for the next two generations. It is cleverly done as a movie, and the twist twenty minutes from the end puts the rest of Hollywood's wunderkind to shame! The characters are very predictable, but put themselves down with a distinct lack of ego (but then plastic models can, can't they?). The plot is yet another riff on George Lucas with a 'Metropolis' like society needing a Chosen One to release them to freedom - only the one chosen is not really of heroic stature. But the journey takes him to his destiny - freeing everyone to build their own models and not just what the packet tells them to! It runs out of steam after an hour before the big finish kicks in - plastic model cartoons can only go so far! And the animation can only go so far before iteration (like live action Hollywood!), but the biggest product placement in movies works well enough for long enough long enough to give a great deal of pleasure.","

"Camoo","22 March 2014","Lego Movie is almost in a genre of its own, appealing to kids but I suspect adults will like it more. It's entertaining, with many genuinely hilarious moments, so with respect to shelling out 20+ dollars for a 3D ticket - YES it's worth it. As a film it feels a little more uneven, but the proceedings are so creative that they kinda defy criticismI was really taken by the opening sections, the introduction into the world with the ecstatically happy music and utopian Lego urban landscape I thought was brilliant. But overall I felt there the mocking tone overtook the sincere areas and it ultimately makes the surprise ending hard to take seriously, or to feel moved by. It's crazy fun though - especially in 3D.","

"estreet-eva","1 July 2014","This 90 minute infomercial for the iconic children's toy presents about 20 minutes of clever but plodding world-building. At about that mark, the filmmakers find this whole other hyperactive gear and the jokes come faster than Vin Diesel in a street race. Enough Batman and Star Wars references fly at the audience to give a geek study group fodder for several nights. The movie runs through genres as often as Lego worlds (""Middle Zealand"" being a personal favorite) while teeing up cliché- bursting one-liners as rapidly as audience members can laugh at them. Just at the point of exhaustion, they trout out Will Farrell to play a weirdly-obsessed dad outside the fourth wall. That the writers can take all the plot points, the subplots and the meta-plot and wrap it up into what actually turns out to be a warm and somehow affecting ending speaks to the level of prowess missing from the ""Lost"" TV show. In short, one of the few movies actually worth buying as well as best commercial ever.","

And is not in the running for an Oscar or such like.But.... you have a legion of Lego Lovers and Parents who will have (or even want) to watch this film.And that is the problem: It is basically a ""One Gag Movie"". The gag is animated Lego Pieces and it runs for what seems like an eternity...It feels like someone had a real passion for the concept. Sold it as a movie idea, and then marketing took over. The ""manual"" said: Need something to please everyone and that is what they built. But speed it up for those kids with no attention span....The pace is frantic. The jokes lame. The animation okay. The message wholesome. The Lego Cameos in place. The Pop Culture references ticked.They have a winner and good luck to them. But a little more thought, style, pacing and story would have produced a much better flick.Pixar and Dreamworks have a good handle on quality family animation. I am sure it would have been much better in their hands.","

"estebangonzalez10","8 February 2014","""Let's take extra care to follow the instructions or you'll be put to sleep, and don't forget Taco Tuesday's coming next week.""The directors behind this very creative and imaginative animated film, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (21 Jump Street), deliver a highly entertaining and hilarious movie thanks to a sharp script which is packed with extremely funny lines and hundreds of pop culture references. It also benefits from a talented cast who do excellent voice work here. Despite being a film that promotes its very own Lego empire, it still works because it has lots of heart and reaches to kids and adults alike. Kids who are fans of the TV series Ninjago will have a great time with this film, while adults will love the witty script beside the fact that it will touch their nostalgic senses. The Lego movie took me back to my childhood days and reminded me of when I played with these building blocks and invented adventures as I played with them. In a way this film felt like I was watching a very smart and creative kid playing with his Lego figures. I can think of no other movie where you get so many pop cultural references as this one. In what other film do you get to see an NBA star like Shaq share a scene with a Ninja Turtle, Batman, Han Solo, Gandalf, Dumbledore, and Wonder Woman all together? These character cameos keep on coming throughout the film with silly but hilarious and witty one-liners. Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt) is an ordinary Lego mini-figure who is content with his life following orders from Lord Business (Will Ferrell) as well as most of the other citizens. What they don't know is that Lord Business is planning on gluing their universe together. When Emmet stumbles across a mysterious block he is mistakenly identified as the chosen one and considered to be one of the MasterBuilders called to save the world. He is drafted by Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and is introduced to the different Lego universes that Lord Business has been keeping separated. He teams up with other MasterBuilders like Batman (Will Arnett), Unikitty (Alison Brie), Metal Beard (Nick Offerman), and several others all led by the old wise man Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman). Together they begin a quest to stop Lord Business from destroying their worlds, but they have to face fierce opposition from Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) and the rest of the police force who serve Lord Business. A task which Emmet isn't really prepared for as he is simply an ordinary mini figure, but who everyone is depending on to save the world. The plot is a little over the top and silly, but it works thanks to some great gags and witty dialogues. The script writers, Dan Hageman, Kevin Hageman, Lord, and Miller know their pop culture references and use it to their advantage. It took me a while to get used to the animation style as it was done by using Lego figures in stop motion and combing it with CGI effects. They did paint a colorful and imaginative world and soon I was won over by the style of the film. It's a fast paced movie and one that you will probably have no problem in wanting to go back and rewatching it considering the jokes are so fast paced that you might have missed lots of them.","

"palavitsinis","28 March 2016","Well, first of all, when you hear about a Lego Movie you think to yourself ""this will be fun""! In the end, it was not. Nicely done for small children I guess, although sometimes the humor was more ""adult"". I enjoyed only a handful of scenes that were nicely done but nothing more than that. The script was nice but needless to say that I just watched one hour and then switched the TV off. Nice messages and approach for the society we live in, but in some way it just was not good enough. Don't waste your time on it. I am really baffled by the really high score of the movie. I don't know, maybe I missed something that all the others see (apart from the end of the movie!).","

The jokes are chuckle worthy, the characters are somewhat interesting, but ultimately forgettable, the story is entertaining but not overly engaging.

"Hitchcoc","22 July 2015","The nice thing about Legos is that they can be anything. They have the plastic malleability to become structures, characters, villains; you name it. Of course, just about every movie for kids is about saving the earth or the universe. This is a non-stop fountain of the primary colors that keeps going. The strength isn't so much in the plot but in the multiple way the Legos can be used to show emotions and true ""humanity."" There is some romance and some brinkmanship, but ultimately it gets down to true creativity. The universe is truly the Lego board and if you or your kids have ever played together, you know the overwhelming possibilities. There are some pretty good songs in here but, I must admit, they have become pretty tiresome.","

"matthewssilverhammer","17 February 2014","I could see someone having some small problems with The Lego Movie, but if you leave saying, ""I didn't like that"", you are lying. This is an immensely likable, even lovable, comedy. Full of childlike ingenuity and imagination, it manages to be a pretty blatant Lego commercial while also being a critique of the museum-like treatment of Legos in modern times and a promotion of learning to play again. But most of all, it's just plain fun. Combining elements of Toy Story, Time Bandits, Naked Gun, and ""Adventure Time"", this is by far the most vibrant and funny movie of 2014. It's the story of a construction worker learning to break from his every day, humdrum existence to bring uniqueness back to his world. In order to do this, he must join a slew of pop culture icons, which looks like comic-con threw up Legos. The spoof like humor and great non-sequiturs are the bread and butter, offering constant and consistent laughs. However, the movie succeeds in so many other ways: it's a uniquely shot action movie, makes poignant points about thinking for yourself, and has some great commentary on the difference between truth and cynicism. Even with some potentially heavy-handed schmaltz at the end, the movie manages to just plain work. Perhaps the most impressive part is the animation, which is oddly and insanely beautiful, sticking to the limitation of real Legos. On whole, TLM is a uniquely refreshing experience, laugh-out-loud funny, and stacks of pure awesomeness.","

"nicolefe92","20 June 2014","Lego should leave the filmmaking business alone. This movie was awful. Simple as that. I really wanted to like this and stayed all the way till it ended just in case, but i wanted to leave in the first 15 minutes and it only got worstThey tried too hard to make jokes and make it funny and it just didn't work. You don't care about the characters one bit and Batman its only funny the first time. All the good jokes were in the trailer so that doesn't help either. Its just trying too hard, without much plot or character development. I watched at least five people leave the theater early and my little cousin say that we should have stayed home instead. It relays on other movie classic characters too much but I'm sorry, the cameo of Han Solo and C3PO is not enough. My recommendation: don't be fooled by the ratings and avoid this movie. Maybe Lego bought the critics as a marketing strategy. So disappointing.","

"trevorreddin82","9 February 2014","My 5 yr old son saw the trailer and thought it looked fantastic. Loads of humour and visual jokes. When we went to cinema we were disappointed to find the trailer showed the best bits and the film was just plumped out in between. Having the different characters from different Lego sets was a good idea too as he was able to recognise them especially batman. He got restless towards the end in the basement scenes. The song was catchy and fun and the way everything was made from Lego was of course great. But the filmmakers really struggle with kids films. They either nail it like Shrek and Toy Story or fail like Gnomeo&Juliet and Brave. The Lego movie falls into the latter category. It may be OK for adults and older children that play a lot of Lego but for the younger ones I would avoid it.","

"proud_luddite","1 July 2019","This animated feature follows an ordinary-living construction worker who is accidentally pulled into a group of people that includes superheroes. Their goal is to stop the evil President Business from destroying the world. The animation takes place in a massive Lego construct.The early part of the film has a clever pace though it seems to depend too much on cartoon violent slapstick for cheap laughs. While there are better humourous moments elsewhere in the film, it seems to miss opportunities to satirize our modern world. It seems to get close to doing so but then stops short.One such example is the rightly named character President Business. He is so mean-spirited, narrow-minded, vicious, and bullying that he could easily have been modeled after certain political leaders of today. There were missed chances to show how such a character is destroying Earth's environment. Instead, the film seems more to follow a far-out science-fiction fantasy premise.I know I'm of the dissenting opinions here as the film is very popular with high critical acclaim. Still, I could only like ""The Lego Movie"" to a point. In any case, I did appreciate its message that ""ordinary"" people might be smarter than what most people would think.","

"jboothmillard","21 February 2014","Since 1949 the popular line of construction toys have been entertaining children and all the family for generations, becoming a worldwide brand of not just the colourful interlocking plastic bricks and small figures, but with merchandising, games, books/magazines, clothing, stores and theme parks/hotels, becoming the most successful toy of all time, now at last Lego (made in Denmark, the Danish name translated means ""play well"") becomes a movie, from the creators of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Basically eight and a half years ago wizard Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) failed to stop evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from stealing super weapon the ""Kragle"", but he warned the villain a prophecy where a person called the ""Special"" will find the Piece of Resistance which will stop the weapon. Ordinary construction worker Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt) spots a woman called Wyldstyle (Slither's Elizabeth Banks) searching for something at the construction site, investigating he falls into a hole and unintentionally finds the Piece of Resistance, touches it he experiences vivid visions and wakes up with it attached to his back, he is held in custody by Lord Business's lieutenant Bad Cop (also Good Cop), he learns about the villain's plan to destroy the world with the Kragle. Wyldstyle rescues Emmet and takes him to Vitruvius who explains they are ""Master Builders"", they can build anything they need, in great speed without manuals, Lord Business disapproved of this creativity and stole the Kragle (a tube of ""Krazy Glue"") for his eventual plan to freeze the universe perfectly in place, as the ""Special"" Emmet is destined to stop him, but he has no creativity of his own. Bad Cop becomes more obedient to villain (with Good Cop rubbed away) and he is determined to track the heroes down, Wyldstyle's boyfriend Batman (Ratatouille's Will Arnett) rescues them, they all travel Cloud Cuckoo Land, where all Master Builders characters remain and can build anything they want. The characters are unimpressed with Emmet being the supposed ""chosen one"", they refuse to help fight Lord Business, then the land is attacked, everyone is captured but Emmet, Wyldstyle, Batman, Unikitty the unicorn cat (Alison Brie), Benny the insane astronaut (Horrible Bosses' Charlie Day) and Metal Beard the robotic pirate (Nick Offerman), Emmet becomes leader and believes they should work together, so they build a plane to invade Lord Business's headquarters. They almost succeed, but are captured, Vitruvius is killed, before dying he admits the prophecy was made up, Business throws the Piece of Resistance off the edge of the universe and sets the headquarters to self-destruct, taking the Kragle and leaving Bad Cop behind, the ghost of Vitruvius tells Emmet although the prophecy was untrue he can still save the world, he takes the self-destruct device and sacrifices himself falling into the edge of the universe. The Master Builders escape and are inspired by Wyldstyle's message of Emmet's bravery, rallying together with Bad Cop, who has his Good Cop face restored with marker pen, they charge against Lord Business. In fact Emmet is not dead, he fell into the real world, the story has all been in the imagination of a little boy, Finn (Jadon Sand), and his father aka ""The Man Upstairs"" (Will Ferrell) is unhappy his son is playing with his personal Lego set, mixing characters together and jumbling new creations, the child argues Lego is for children, but the father wants things permanently glued together. Back in the Lego world Emmet realises what The Man Upstairs will do, so he forces himself to move, getting Finn's attention, the boy returns him to the set and gives him the Master Builder abilities to confront Lord Business, the father looks at Finn's creations, finds himself impressed, and notices the villain is based on him, he has a change of heart and allows his son to play with the Lego whenever he wants. In the end Lord Business is convinced that all should be free to do whatever they want, he destroys the Kragle and unfreezes all his victims, this in the real world is the father removing all super glue from the Lego set, and Batman steps down allowing Emmet and Wyldstyle, real name Lucy, to celebrate freedom and embrace, but a new threat comes to the Lego world, the father will allow Finn's little sister to play with the set as well, so Duplo alien creatures will invade and plan to destroy them. Also starring Channing Tatum as Superman, Jonah Hill as Green Lantern. Billy Dee Williams as Lando, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Keith Ferguson as Han Solo, Will Forte as Abraham Lincoln, Shaquille O'Neal as Shaq, Cobie Smulders as Wonder Woman, Jorma Taccone as Shakespeare, Dave Franco, James's brother as Wally and Graham Miller as Duplo. Pratt is good as the unreliable but enthusiastic hero, Ferrell is terrific as the memorable villain and in real life as the father, Freeman is good support as the wise blind wizard, Arnett gets good puns and lines as Batman, and the other supporting voices, including the cameos, are great fun too. It is odd to think that this film is all computer animated, because it looks so much like stop motion in the way that it plays out, but that was the intention, it makes everything look more realistic, and adds to the charm and the humour, the dialogue and sight gags are all funny for all ages, and the use of the colourful bricks for everything you can imagine absolutely works, and it has a good message how imagination and freedom of expression is very positive and inspiring, an awesome computer-animated action comedy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Everything is Awesome"", it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, it won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated for the BAFTA Kids Vote - Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Lego was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Toys, and Batman was number 84 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!","

I am glad I used passes or I would have been harsher if I spent good money on it. Compared to Clutch Powers The Lego movie was not as polished and the heroes I wanted to see that were in the commercials were only in the feature for a few seconds. The ol' bait and switch like Wreck It Ralph pulled IMO. I also felt dizzy watching some of the action scenes and lost track of what was going on. Thanks goodness I skipped 3D or it would have been worse. I would recommend waiting to see this on video instead of at the theatre.

"Tweekums","22 February 2017","Lego construction worker Emmet is a bit of a drone; he watches the most popular TV show, he listens to the most popular song and most importantly he always follows the instructions. Then one day he loses his instructions; he searches the construction site for it and stumbles upon the 'Piece of Resistance'. Also there is a girl named Wyldstyle who was looking for the piece. She explains to him that is a near mythical item that will enable the 'Special' to defeat the evil President Business. She assumes that Emmet is the Special but the more she sees of him the less sure she is. Far from being the Master Builder she expected he has just about zero imagination. Before they can conform Business they will team up with Wylestyle's boyfriend, Batman; recruit other Master Builders and keep one step ahead of Business's henchman, Bad Cop.When I played with Lego as a child I never imagined that one day there would be a Lego movie and if I had I doubt I'd have imagined that it would be enjoyed by anybody apart from young children but here I am, almost fifty, and I must say I really enjoyed this film. It is chock full of references to other films in a way that older viewers will love without boring younger viewers who don't get the references. The characters are a lot of fun; Emmet and Wyldestyle are great leads but it is Batman who steals the show, it is no wonder that he just got his own movie. The story is simple enough for younger viewers and the execution is imaginative in a way that should entertain all ages. If there is a weakness it is when the action moves to the real world and we see a boy playing with his father's Lego; here we get the message of the movie and it is about as subtle as a brick (not a Lego brick); it also pulls the viewer out of the story just as it reaches its peak; still it isn't enough to spoil this entertaining film. The animation is great; it is especially impressive when we see Lego creations being made in front of our eyes. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to any fan of animated movies; it is fun from start to finish.","

"williampsamuel","12 December 2014","There's a song which plays at several points in the Lego movie called ""Everything is Awesome."" The song itself is a generic, unremarkable, annoyingly catchy piece of techno pop, which some of the main characters make a point of deriding. But it perfectly sums up the Lego Movie, because everything in this movie is awesome. There is so much action, so much humor, so many characters and settings. It would take all the money in Hollywood to make a movie with this many explosions, car chases, aerial chases, giant robot battles and magical worlds, not to mention the problems with continuity and logic. But with Lego none of that matters because a world made entirely out of interlocking plastic bricks has its own.That's why a lowly construction worker can become the chosen hero by falling down a hole and touching a glowing brick, then find himself on the run from every cop in the world with a beautiful mysterious woman, all with no idea what's going on and barely more exposition than I've just given here. That's why Batman, Han Solo, Gandalf, Dumbledore, Abraham Lincoln, the 2002 NBA all-stars and a cat/unicorn thing that talks like certain infamous ponies can all be characters in the same movie, and can go from a modern city to the old west, ""Middle Zealand"", the bottom of the sea and a giant office building above ""the void of nothingness"" with no complicated explanation. Heck, in a world made of Legos it doesn't even matter why the evil Lord Business and his henchman Bad Cop want to destroy the world, or why they don't have better names than ""Lord Business"" and ""Bad Cop."" None of this matters because it just doesn't and because everything is so awesome. The frequent action scenes continually outdo each other in spectacle and ridiculousness. The jokes are constant and come in every variety from simple puns, slapstick and sight gags to subtle film and historical references, witty social commentary, and in-jokes about this movie's lack of logic. Plus the movie makes full use of the alternate logic I mentioned earlier. If something catches on fire, fire shaped Lego pieces cover it. Ocean waves are shifting piles of blue studs. Polish remover can get rid of unwanted alternate. The fact that anything can be taken apart and turned into anything else isn't just a cute gimmick; it's a major plot device. And it's hard to imagine a movie that's not in Lego featuring a decapitation and keeping a G-rating.And then comes the twist; the kind of twist to make a young and still talented M. Night Shyamalan jealous. A twist that not only changes everything, but explains everything: the extremely loose continuity, why the characters that aren't recognizable pop culture figures are generic clichés, even why the elderly wizard's advice sounds like a mix of worn out platitudes and recent pop culture slogans. It's a twist that's so obvious in retrospect but so works perfectly anyway. What I'm saying here is that it's a really good twist. And even better is what the filmmaker's do with it, turning a sprawling fantasy/ sci-fi epic into a charming tale about the power of childlike imagination. The first hour is pure fun and will delight children of all ages. The imagination and depth of the last fifteen minutes make the Lego Movie the best animated feature since Toy Story 3.","

"TxMike","8 July 2014","This is a curious movie. I had not heard much about it, but knew it was highly regarded. My wife and I started watching it last night, but shut it off after about 45 minutes. It didn't seem interesting at all.But today I gave it another chance, finished it, and now understand. While it never will be one of my favorite animated movies, it was fun to watch especially during the last 10 to 15 minutes.I tried to find out about how they made it by re-watching it with the DVD's cast commentary, but let me tell you that is one of the most annoying commentaries I've ever witnessed. Fortunately someone asked if most of the movie is computer animated or actual shots of Lego pieces, sort of in a claymation style of animation. As it turns out almost all of it uses computer-generated images, but they did it in a way that it looks like real Lego pieces were used. I would guess that a person who grew up with Legos (not me) would get a bigger kick out of it. There's some funny stuff, like being afraid of the 'Kragle', which we see is 'Krazy Glue' with the letters 'z-y-u' scratched out from use. But it mainly seems to want to give the message that each of us has the ability to accomplish great things, and 'everything is awesome, everything is cool when you're part of a group.'SPOILERS: For most of the movie we see Lego figures and Lego machines in various settings, buildings, streets, etc. Their small world is animated, it is as if they are alive, and I suppose in a sense they are. But then we see it is a giant Lego set built in a basement, and the dad (Will Ferrell) comes down the stairs to see his young son has made some alterations to what Dad had built.

"bravesfanc","23 February 2014","I will say that when I saw the preview for this movie I wasn't too excited about it. I was never a fan of Lego's even as a kid and never really played with them. Only through the great reviews and word of mouth did I decide why not give this a shot and I'm glad I did.I didn't see it in 3D and it might have made it more entertaining with the way the special effects were used. It was a clever piece of work with the way they portrayed water, fire, smoke, and a whole bunch of different things.Even though most kids will want to see this, its the adults that will probably be heard most in the theater laughing. The jokes are more for the adults but because its Lego's the kids will have a fun time too. There is a bit of a twist at the end that I didn't see coming.Overall, its simply just a fun time at the movies that both the kids and adults will equally enjoy.","

"MissSimonetta","15 February 2014","The Lego Movie (2014) is something that could have easily been a quick, uninspired cash-in, but much to my surprise it took my breath away with how unique, quirky, funny, and even touching it was.The animation is unique: though it's pure CG, it evokes stop motion and creatively utilizes its Lego world. Though I'm always skeptical of celebrity voice acting, all the actors do a great job here, especially Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, and Will Ferrell.The story riffs on the oft-used ""chosen one saves the world"" plot and comes across as something a child would make up as they went along. It is this quality that transports the viewer back to his or her own childhood. I didn't much play with Legos as a kid, but I do remember using my dolls and whatever else was around to create crazy characters and adventures.A wonderful flick. Do make sure to see it in a packed theater, because the mirth and laughter are absolutely infectious.","

"Gordon-11","24 June 2014","This film tells the story of a young man who is not very bright or memorable. He turns out to be the unlikely hero who saves the Lego worlds from am evil billionaire.The characters are so cute and colorful, and I really like the scenes where they show the posts number on the screen. The story is lighthearted and fun, and actually borders on being silly. If it was a film with real life actors, it would not have worked. It would have been to silly and too contrived. But it's Lego, and therefore it had to be fun, and every bass thing about it can be excused! It's not just a film, but a film that brings back collective memories of the childhood. Therefore it is more enjoyable than just the film on its own. Tinted by the happy childhood memories, everything about the movie becomes awesome!","

"seruanyre","21 January 2023","""The Lego Movie"" is a truly innovative and entertaining film that pushes the boundaries of animation and storytelling. From the moment the film starts, it is clear that the filmmakers have put in a great deal of effort to create a world that is both familiar and unique. The animation is absolutely stunning, with every frame bursting with color and detail. The characters are all well-developed and likable, and the plot is both funny and heartwarming. It's hard not to be charmed by Emmet and his quest to save the Lego universe.However, the real strength of ""The Lego Movie"" is its clever and meta commentary on the nature of storytelling and creativity. The film is filled with clever jokes and references that will delight both children and adults alike, and the message of the movie - that everyone has the ability to be creative and tell their own story - is both empowering and uplifting.The film also features a fantastic voice cast, including Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, and Will Ferrell, who all do a great job of bringing the characters to life. The film's soundtrack is also noteworthy, with catchy and memorable songs that will have you humming along long after the film is over.Overall, ""The Lego Movie"" is a must-see for anyone who loves animation, comedy, and a good story. It's clever, funny, and heartfelt, and it's sure to delight audiences of all ages.","

"grantss","6 April 2015","Novel graphics, good fun.I had low expectations for this movie, thinking it was simply a kids movie. Turns out it is suitable for all ages. Interesting, though not that original, plot. Very funny, snappy, dialogue. Generally, a good action-comedy.Obviously, the thing that stands out most is the use of Lego for everything. Incredibly original in that regard.Great casting for the voices: Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Liam Neeson, Will Arnett, Jonah Hill, among others. Best of the lot, in my view, is Will Arnett as Batman. Very funny.Not perfect though. Plot gets quite random, almost silly, towards the end. The novelty of the graphics wears off too. Plus there are scenes where the Lego graphics don't do the movie any favours - you sometimes struggle to figure out what you're seeing.Overall: good entertainment.","

"LeonLouisRicci","27 September 2014","Overstuffed to the Max, this CGI Brick Bash has a Lot Going for it, Namely Familiarity. There are Constant Character References that are Already in the Brain and Make for Easy Access and Satire, and of Course the Toy Set Itself (the word Lego is never mentioned), that has been Around Since 1949.Ultra-Kinetic and Cut Like a TV Commercial (like just about everything else Today), it Seems to Embrace the Attention Span Deficit as though it is Sacrosanct and Young People Cannot Live with a Micro-Second of Reflection. This Works for Awhile but can be Overwhelming to Anyone Needing to Take a Breath.Ironically, the Movie Comes to a Crashing Halt when Live Actors Show Up, Things Slow Way Down, and the Final Fifteen Minutes Go from Wacky to Completely Out of Whack. It's Light Speed Pacing Collides with a Brick Wall and Never Recovers. The Film Could have been a Complete and Persistent Piece of Art Without the Worn Out Preaching from an Unenlightened Dad and the Writers. It is a Flaw that is just too Big to Ignore and Drags the Thing Down to a Normal Level that the Movie Abandoned So Well. Until then the Audience was in a Completely Different Time-Space Continuum and One Wonders Why such a Misstep was Included. Overall it is a Right Angle Amalgam of Pop Culture Icons and Ultra-Brite Colors Flashed with a Frenetic Blast of Plasticized Eye Candy with a Clever Storyline and a Ponderance of Puns.","

"agmoldham","25 March 2014","I'm not sure whether it is good or bad, but there were no kids at all in the theater when I watched the Lego movie - It was the last screening of the day and there weren't too many adults around either. I saw the 2d version of the film, but suspect the visuals may have been even more impressive in 3d. The Lego movie tells the story of Emmet who is a very ordinary lego figure mistaken for the chosen one who will save lego. He has to escape the attentions of the evil Lord Business who wants to end the universe and the good cop/bad cop who is tasked with finding him by Lord Business. He is helped along the way by Wyldstyle who recognises that he is the chosen one. The movie is fast paced with loads of action and cameos by numerous faces from popular culture. I will not spoil the surprise by listing these, but the film is great fun from start to finish. I suspect the humour will appeal more to adults than children, but don;t have anything to back up this gut feel. Good fun!!","

"diac228","11 February 2014","Now, read the upcoming phrase carefully, because it might come as a bit of a shock.The Lego Movie is the best animated film, and the best overall family film since 2010's Toy Story 3.Pick up your jaw, and hear me out. The Lego Movie screams, embellishes, breathes creativity, heart, and soul that has been lacking severely in most animated movies in recent years. It is a skillfully directed movie that has so much detail you might need multiple viewings to catch all the fun. This movie hits on every single aspect of filmmaking, and took everything that worked on the Disney Renaissance and the Pre-Cars 2 Pixar era and gave it a nice whimsical spin thanks to the concept of the building block toys that stand out in American culture.Where do I start? The Lego Movie is the perfect blend of kids, adult, and nostalgic entertainment that will keep everyone's eyes glued to the screen regardless of age. Whether it's the fun, joyful sounds and colors and visual jokes that will make the kids happy, or all the fun subtle pop culture and nostalgic jabs that will entertain adults, there is something for anyone involved. The animation was astounding and easily has some of the best meticulous visuals since Ratatouille.The best kinds of stories for animated movies are those that start out simple for the tykes, but secretly contain layers of content for the more established minds. This is what made your earlier Pixar movies so appealing for a vast audience; it never talks down to the viewer but doesn't overwhelm the kiddies. In The Lego Movie, what starts out as a simple tale about a prophesy defeating a tyrannical villain from taking over the environment morphs into a beautiful story about finding your voice and being original.Like previously stated, all aspects of this movie work. The voice acting was phenomenal, especially Elizabeth Banks as the lead female, Liam Neeson as Good Cop/Bad Cop, and Will Arnett as Batman (he does a better Batman than Christian Bale—seriously). The musical score was on-point, the humor and action run plentiful, and there's plenty of heart and soul that will tug the heartstrings. Just wait until you arrive at the final act. Unlike practically every movie nowadays, you won't see it coming.It might be hard to believe that a movie with serious marketing and product placement implications becomes the best around since this past summer with Before Midnight. It might be even harder to believe that Warner Brothers has managed to surpass the usual suspects of Pixar (notice all the movies I've referenced in the review) and Dreamworks at their very own game. Nonetheless, this shocker of a gem is the perfect family cinematic package. From top to bottom The Lego Movie delivers. If this isn't one of the best films of 2014, then we are in for a spectacular year of cinema because this movie is seriously a work of kinetic brilliance.Recommend to the highest degree, no matter who you are or how old you are.","

"anaconda-40658","5 May 2015","The Lego Movie (2014): Dir: Phil Lord, Chris Miller / Voices: Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Liam Neeson: One of the most original and impressive animations since Toy Story. Physically it regards the building toy blocks that have been around for decades. It also symbolizes the building of friendship and loyalty. Chris Pratt voices Emmet an average construction worker who comes across a mysterious female rebel named Wyldstyle. When he falls down a hole he is arrested and learns that he has a piece of the resistance attached to him. The villain is Lord Business whose war is against anything that disturbs his view of normality. He plans to use a substance called the Kragle, which is a tube of Krazy Glue with certain letters rubbed out. This is being used to glue the universe in place. Directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller whose previous credits include the overrated 21 Jump Street. Emmet is the portrait of the average joe and indicates that everyone is important and gifted. Emmet is not that intelligent yet has the amusing ability to come up with bizarre ideas. Elizabeth Banks voices the rebellious Wydestyle who is out to find her importance. Will Arnett steals moments voicing Batman who is Wydestyle's boyfriend. Will Ferrell voices the tyrant Lord Business as well as appear in reality as a struggling father. Liam Neeson steals moments voicing Good Cop / Bad Cop who is the henchmen of Lord Business. There is also a host of other popular pop culture characters as well as hilarious references that will allow adults to build on enthusiasm as well as children. Score: 9 / 10","

"FlashCallahan","8 February 2014","The idea of a Lego movie really didn't entice my enthusiasm one Iota, and the trailer was even more discouraging.But i'm here to say that this is one of the funniest, sweetest, family films I've seen in a while.The premise is simple, a prophecy is held stating that a special master builder will find a piece that will defeat lord business, and stop him from destroying the world.Jump eight and a half years later, we meet Emmet, an ordinary man who follows the instructions by the book, and goes unnoticed by his work colleagues and pretty much everyone in general.That is until he spots a stranger around the building site, and he discovers the sacred piece, and a policeman who's less than friendly....Suddenly his life changes forever....First and foremost its a kids movie, but its a film for everyone. Not one of those movies that has separate jokes for adults, but one that the whole family can laugh at/with.And the reason why the film works, is because it's just so bonkers that you cannot help but love it. One minute we have a wonderful Batman being cocky toward everybody, or Superman trying to avoid The Green Lantern, or Han Solo trying to find a party, to Milhouse.There's something here for everyone. The voice work is brilliant, and even though the leads are brilliant Neeson steals the movie from everyone as his bad cop/good cop hybrid.The adventure goes from world to different world, and each world carries a vast array of colour and character, but that's not the joker up,the movies sleeve.The final third spins the whole film on its head, and turns it into a totally different film that you were watching for seventy five minutes.Its clever, funny, and most of all, touching.Well worth seeing with the whole family, and see it before people tell you the secret....","

And everyone else does great, too: Chris Pratt, Liam Neeson, Nick Offerman, and especially Elizabeth Banks (god, she can make reading the phone book sound sexy). No one expected much from this movie when it was announced (myself included), so to see just how good this thing turned out is the real surprise. It's well-written, damn well-animated (so much of this CGI looks genuinely stop-motion; top-notch stuff) and features an array of great characters. But most of all, it's a whole lot of fun.9/10","

"gbill-74877","12 January 2022","""People everywhere are always messing with my stuff. But I have a way to fix that. A way to keep things exactly the way they are supposed to be. Permanently.""That quote pretty much summarizes conservatism, doesn't it? I love the social/political messages slipped into this fun, clever film, with a character called President Business keeping the public dumb and happy through vapid entertainment and free tacos. He's all about maintaining his possessions, not serving the public. It's a land where workers mindlessly sing ""Everything is Awesome,"" believing in rosy optimism, and overlook the sinister things going on right in front of them.You certainly don't have to see a critique of America to enjoy this film though, as it works on several levels. The jokes and references are fresh, and the pace is great. The visuals, making things like ocean waves out of Legos, are highly creative, and the way the story ties together in a real-life basement is fantastic. There are wonderfully positive messages relating to nonconformity, believing in oneself, and understanding that everyone has an ability to make a difference, and should be empowered. It cuts through many traditional film tropes, including those around superheroes and stories with a ""chosen one,"" even if the romance is a bit standard. All that and appearance from Lego Shaq too, I mean, what else could you ask for?","

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8 February 2019","I mean, it's just great. 'The Lego Movie (2014)' is a smart, unexpected and, frankly, hilarious animation that's actually much more than the sum of its parts - not to mention being much, much better than pretty much anyone anticipated, especially considering that it's essentially an extended advert of sorts (perhaps the best, most product-aware advert I've ever seen). The hit-rate of its humour is incredibly high. It's genuinely funny on more than one occasion, providing several big belly-laughs. Even when it isn't 'laugh-out-loud', there's something amusing or clever that keeps an ear-to-ear smile on your face, essentially, every few seconds. The piece is also remarkably heartfelt. It manages to keenly deliver a few important and considered messages, round off all its core characters in satisfying ways and conflate its masterful but somewhat 'out there' twist with its already established world, all while delivering a fast-paced, mile-a-minute, almost visually-psychedelic adventure. Seriously, there's a moment near the end that comes really close to making me tear up. That's not bad for a picture about talking plastic bricks. Speaking of which, the animation itself is stunning. Everything is made of individual digital Lego pieces, most of which have fingerprints and scratches on them. This, combined with the stop-motion style and dedication to only using replicas of real-world pieces (there's no cheating here), makes for an impressively tangible but delightfully playful feast-for-the-eyes, one that packs so much stuff into each and every plausibly (if nigh on impossibly) real-life recreatable frame. It's just great. It's easily one of the best animated features that I've ever seen. If one were to be cynical and say it were just an extended advert and not a proper film, then I'd fire back and say that, as I mentioned, it's straight-up the best advert I've ever seen, by a wide margin, that's better than a lot of 'proper', non product-placement containing pictures. It's an advert that I'd be happy to watch again and again. Well played, Lord and Miller. Well played, indeed. 9/10","

"siderite","21 January 2015","In this computer animated movie based on Lego pieces, Chris Pratt saves the universe. Again. And while the animation was original and well done while and I don't have any qualms with the actors or direction, this film is just another Hollywood film about the hapless hero who finds it in himself the power to save everybody - if he has a lot of luck - and proves to everybody that he is ""special"".Like many others, when I first heard of the premise of the film I thought I would not see it, but then I heard so many people describing it as a cool movie that, in the end, I gave up and watched it. Yes, it is nicely done, yes it has a lot of nods to other movies, yes it has some funny scenes, but in the end it is just... not special.And I am not saying this because I am mean or because I think a Lego movie should be deep and profound and morally ambiguous so that adults would get it, not just little kids, but because the message of the film is as cliché and conformist as they come. In a story about people removing the constraints of set rules and following instructions, the main message is ""be yourself!"". That's original.So, yeah, it is a good movie, but it was so over-hyped that I couldn't enjoy its story mediocrity. Huge amounts of money were poured into this film, with good actors used for voice only, cool animation, but the bottom line is that... I've seen this before.","

But very few dads fail to spend huge chunks of their family's budgets on their metaphorical Own Private Lego Lands (whether it's collectible beer cans, trout fishing flies, vinyl records, comic books & action figures in their original shrink-wrapped boxes, etc.).

I do not know what has happened but I will continue to write reviews with my Grade and Number Rating if I never see it ever again. Now onto the review! Am I The Only One Who Thinks This is Great Political Commentary on Today's Society? No. Just ask Mark Caleb Smith in his article called ""Everything is Awesome: The Politics Of The Lego Movie"" Which says that the film takes place in a dictatorship or Totalitarianism Government and ends on a great note.Why? Lets begin with the story. The Lego Movie follows Emmett who is a construction worker in Lego City. He one day falls into a hole finding a red Lego piece and blanks out. He wakes up being interrogated by Good Cop/Bad Cop and is rescued by a rebel who mistakes him as a Master Builder. He now has to get the Red Lego Piece to put on a glue stick to stop President Business from gluing everything together. On his way he meets a bunch of colorful characters and cameos.I went to see a Sold out Showing at 7:45 tonight and it didn't disappoint. Everyone was laughing, cheering, and applauding till the end. The children in the auditorium were very quiet while watching this which I'm surprised by considering when I went to see Planes they were loud and noisy.The casting was good. Alison Brie plays a cross between a unicorn and a cat who likes happy thoughts and love. But don't make her angry or she will turn into a monster! She was probably my favorite character in this entire film and her casting was perfect because Brie is well known for playing soft hearted cheery women.As for the story, I love it! I love that clichéd story where the chosen one has to save the world! It never gets old.The animation is brilliant combining stop motion and CGI technology to make one of the most breathtaking experiences in movies for this year.I wont spoil the twists, but they are awesome and unpredictable.As I was saying about the Political Commentary, The Film's Characters are based off real life people. President Business compares to many Dictators. Unicorn Kitty represents many Russian Leaders of The Soviet Union. So on and So On. But in the end, The Fascist Government is torn apart and individualism spreads joy around the world. I know it sounds crazy, but its true! Look at their characteristics and worlds and you'll see what I'm talking about.This movie is really good. They did an excellent job with everything from the witty script to the casting to the animation. Its a really good family film that will be looked back by children in years to come.Definite must see movie.89/100 B+","

"3xHCCH","11 February 2014","""The Lego Movie"" is an animated film that uses Lego characters and sets to tell a story of how an ordinary guy can actually be extraordinary.Emmett is just an ordinary construction worker who always waited for instructions to follow, never having an original thought by himself. Falling into a hole one day, he found a mysterious red block, which attached itself to Emmett's back. This turned out to be the legendary ""Piece of Resistance"". This item can only be possessed by a hero called the ""Special"" destined to save Lego Land from the nefarious President Business, who threatens everything with ""Kragle"". Threatened, Business sics Bad Cop on Emmett to capture him.Emmett and his friends, the purple-haired Wyldstyle, the old sage Vitruvius and the gruff superhero Batman, escape into Cloud Cuckoo Land to gather up other ""Master Builders"". Who these Master Builders are and how the story goes after this is very complicated to describe in words. It is simply better seen on screen. Just when you think the story is at the limit of its absurdity, a twist happens which grounds everything back to reality.It was fun to hear the voices of Chris Platt, Will Farrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman bring life to the main character. It was fun to see all those cameo appearances of an array of Lego characters from various special Lego sets in the past. Later, it was fun to find out who voiced them (like Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Charlie Day or Billy Dee Williams). I felt this was a very imaginative way to tell a relatively common story. The twist at the final act gave it an additional dimension. There is something about Lego that evokes a special kind of nostalgia in older viewers like me. The 3D was also done very well, and was really appropriate for a animated concept like this one. I will not be surprised if this one lands among the Best Animated Feature Films of this year. 8/10.","

"ElMaruecan82","10 January 2017","Today, before watching an animated movie, the biggest question is ""which element of newness can it ever provide to eyes that have enjoyed hundreds of Disney (and even DreamWorks) classics?"" Indeed, as time goes by and the audiences get more blasé, the probability for an animated film to meet with commercial success might be relatively high, but whether it would stand the test of time and become a classic is another story. Each of the three 'Shrek' sequels did pretty well in the box-office, but compared to the first opus, they're all pretty forgettable.But this is an adjective I wouldn't use for ""The Lego Movie"" as it is a wonderfully crafted and smartly conceived animated comedy. It doesn't just bring enjoyment; it also possesses such a meticulous attention to little details that you wouldn't mind watching it again in case you missed something. Of course, the very premise of an animated movie made of Lego bricks is to challenge the eyes with as many details as one can spot in a simple blink, that's the essence of the Lego bricks, but the writers or creators didn't just take that high-concept for granted: the special effects are the vehicles to a solid plot and a story with a message that is positive without being dull or predictable.There's a moment where all the protagonists meet in Cuckoo Cloud Land (or was it Cloud Cuckoo Land)? And although some of the characters in the background add nothing to the story, the multiple cameos they form is simply irresistible (they go from Simpsons characters to Ninja Turtles or movies and fairy tales icons) you really have to push the pause button if you want to spot each of them. This perfectionism has nothing to envy on Disney's and reward our expectations as we don't expect uncluttered landscapes from a Lego film. And while it starts with Lego Land and the ominous President Business' building, it also gets out of the urban zone of comfort and make us fly over the vast Western canyons or enjoy a trip on and under the sea, the occasion for many cool effects simulating waves, smokes or clouds.Last time I had as much fun was with ""Rango"" and there's some kinship between the two films besides not being from Disney (or another 3D major studio), they have extremely appealing heroes. Rango had a certain edgy quality but Emmett (Christ Pratt) is simply too sweet for words. It's like the writers, instead of taking the wrong step and making the most possibly original character, went to the totally opposite trajectory, making an even more original one. This is a Lego-man who sees the half filled glass, who cheers at everything, because in Lego life, everything is built upon instructions, you can't do any wrong because that's an option life doesn't include. So nothing can upset him: the lousy one-joke sitcom, the overpriced coffee, his motto echoes the town's hymn ""Everything is Awesome"", a cheesy electronic pop hit that seems to come directly from the 90's. But under this cheerful front, Lego Land lives with an impending doom of evil President Business (Will Ferrell) and according to Vitrivirus, a wizard with the voice of Morgan Freeman, a chosen one will save the town (quite a prophecy, isn't it?), it turns out to be Emmett, but he needs to believe it to succeed. The film takes one of the cheesiest clichés but makes it the soul of its message and making something original out of conventional stuff is a stunt I didn't think was possible. And the is the kind of masterstroke I won't dare to spoil but let's just say, there comes a moment where even the comedic inventiveness can't drive the plot, and the writers need an extra push and we make the one discovery that gives its full meaning to the Lego, the reason why anyone can enjoy it.Speaking for myself, I stopped playing Lego when I got a new digit in my age but playing now with my daughter, I rediscover the appeal behind this simple but genius concept, interlocking brick one or another, creating more and more challenging forms, some with a meaning, others not, but avoiding dullness at all costs. There is something in Lego that is so boundlessly creative, that you can't help but feel the need to reinvent stories or scenarios within the limits of your mind's imagination. It's just as if the 3D animation existed before the screen version, and ""The Lego Movie"" was inevitable. And it is perhaps the only animation process where the temptation of portraying the 'player' was so strong, as if there was something subtly existential or deeply metaphysical in that quest for perfection. I had a foretaste after watching the Simpsons 'Lego' episode, there's indeed some great source of creativity behind these little bricks.Nevertheless, this quest for perfection is integral to the film's appeal, so is the need to deconstruct things for the sake of imagination. There was something in that Cuckoo Land that reminded me of South Park's ""Imagination Land"", and this is what the film is about: the power of imagination, and that includes imagining yourself as a hero, and being able to build and to decompose as well. And not to make the film sounds too philosophical, it is also a terrific comedy with superb characters, including Elizabeth Banks as the bad-ass WyldStyle (the jokes about her names never get old), a 80's Spaceman and Unikitty, a hilarious mix of Hello Kitty and 'My Little Pony' style unicorns.Honorable mention to the scene-stealing performance by Bruce Wayne aka Batman and a funny twist on the good cop/bad cop trope, well it's full of pop culture references, they're good but they're not even the best thing about the film.Everything is awesome in that 'Lego' movie and I'm looking forward for the sequels.","

"atlasmb","19 July 2014","You can watch this film and enjoy the CGI effects that make it look like stop-action work with actual Lego blocks or claymation work. Even the water looks like it is constructed from Legos.Or you can also enjoy the many pop culture references. Many of them are related to films. So ""The Lego Movie"" is easy to enjoy for anyone who enjoys movies. It also uses many film conventions (slo-mo action, romantic film scenarios, etc.). There are also references, visual and thematic, to such films/books as ""The Matrix"", ""Transformers"", and even ""Zaradoz"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"".But from the first, this film shows itself to be so much more. It is not merely a satire of pop culture icons. It is a very pointed satire of political and social customs and conventions. Watching those little block-people in their block-world transcends the images themselves and in a graphic way the film presents glimpses into cultural truths that most of us can identify with. How much of my life is about following directions? How much of our culture is designed to make me feel good about the slot it wants to plug me into? How easily does the human brain allow its owner to fool himself, by distractions, into a false sense of individuality?You can enjoy the film on any of these levels. It is extremely well done. Some of the character voices fit their characters so well they are nearly iconic. This is animation, but it is not Disney. It has so much to say that children will not discern. And the action is nonstop so you may find yourself asking how 100 minutes could pass so quickly. Clever, clever, clever. If you liked ""Wreck-It Ralph"", you should like ""The Lego Movie"".","

"paul2001sw-1","26 January 2015","Who could imagine you could make a film about Lego? 'The Lego Movie' actually manages this, with a plot that is an inverse of that of 'Toy Story', and a rich host of jokes, some very funny, fired at a furious pace. The start of the movie could almost be seen as a satire of life in modern China; the romantic subplot (the figurine fancied by the hero turns out to already have a boyfriend - Bat-man - who takes some beating) seems truer to life than most romantic comedies. The presence of Bat-man is just one of many ways the film exploits the vast range of Lego figurines now available, from the ordinary to the iconic - and the film's ultimate message, that ordinary should not mean anonymous, is also a softened version of the naked positivity usually found in American kids' films. What the film lacks is the wonderful reflective pace of 'WALL-E'; it's perpetually noisy and busy, holding the attention of the younger half of its intended audience with a whirligig of flying bricks. For me, it was a little too frenetic to be truly awesome, and of course it's all advertising for the product, but it transcends its modest premise by some margin.","

"CinemaClown","6 June 2014","Based on the famous Lego line of construction toys generations have grown up playing with, The Lego Movie tells the story of an ordinary Lego mini-figure who is a nobody but is mistaken as ""the Special"" when he accidentally discovers the Piece of Resistance & is drafted into a fellowship of strangers with whom he takes an epic journey to stop an evil tyrant from gluing the entire Lego universe together.Written & directed by Phil Lord & Christopher Miller, the film is masterfully envisioned, excellently written, carefully crafted & is infused with heavy use of pop-culture references from start to finish. The animation is wonderful, cinematography provides a vibrant look to the Lego universe, the entire film is terrifically paced, the humour is perfectly timed & the background score makes it even more awesome.Coming to voice performances, The Lego Movie employs a pretty impressive voice cast in Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman & others with each one of them donning the roles of equally fascinating characters amongst which my favourite turned out to be Batman, voiced by Will Arnett. And every single frame in the film pays homage to cinema classics & delivers them in rapid-fire succession.On an overall scale, The Lego Movie is a thoughtfully structured, hilariously narrated & intelligently executed work of originality, fun & creativity that's exuberantly directed, deftly written, gorgeously animated, fiercely paced, splendidly photographed, superbly voiced, nicely scored & is jam-packed with never-ending funny lines plus pop-cultural references throughout its runtime. In short, it's a 90 minute commercial that viewers of all ages are gonna enjoy in more ways than one.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com","

"Hellmant","28 February 2014","'THE LEGO MOVIE': Five Stars (Out of Five)Blockbuster film adaptation of the popular construction toys, which began in Denmark in 1949. Lego is the third-largest toy maker in the world and in recent years has grown immensely in popularity (closing in on Hasbro for the #2 global ranking). The company has expanded it's market into video games, books, theme parks, kids' clothes, cartoon shows and straight-to-DVD animated movies and now it's conquered the theatrical film business as well with this 3D computer animated comedy/adventure flick. The movie has been number one for three weeks in a row (at the US box office) making $185,829,929 in North America and $278,329,929 worldwide! I found it to be very entertaining and my two young nephews (I saw it with) loved it as well. The story revolves around Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt), an average construction worker Lego minifigure who's mistakenly prophesied to be the 'chosen one'; who will save the Lego universe from an evil businessman called Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Emmet has always been an outsider and has never been accepted by his acquaintances or co-workers. He finally feels important for the first time in his Lego life and goes on a journey to save the Lego world. Emmet receives help from a rebel fighter named Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), a wise wizard named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), Batman (Will Arnett), Superman (Channing Tatum), Green Lantern (Jonah Hill) and others. The voice cast also includes Liam Neeson, Will Forte, Charlie Day, Nick Offerman, Alison Brie and many other popular stars.It was directed and co-written (with Dan and Kevin Hageman) by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Lord and Miller also performed the same duties on the popular animated hit 'CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS' and directed the film adaptation of the popular 80's TV show '21 JUMP STREET' as well (and it's upcoming sequel). The Hagemans also co-wrote 36 episodes of the Cartoon Network's animated TV series 'LEGO NINJAGO: MASTERS OF SPINJITZU' (which is based on the Lego toys of the same name). The filmmakers chosen were obviously the right guys for the job and the cast couldn't be more perfectly fitting either. The result is an animated movie masterpiece; I absolutely loved it and I can't usually get into animated films that much! It's hilarious, visually amusing and surprisingly emotional as well (especially in the end; when I actually got a little teary eyed). There is a twist that really takes the film up a notch and makes it more meaningful (and special) for kids and adults as well. I realized, by the end, that it's a lot like another telling of 'TOY STORY' and I think it's just as well made and classic too. I'm sure 'THE LEGO MOVIE' will be beloved for many years to come, by many generations (just like the toys)!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2NdCvPRYk4","

"christophe92300","11 November 2014","The Lego Movie is in the same vein as a Pixar production, this animated movie will therefore appeal to the younger audience as well as the older viewers thanks to the richness of the references and the characters density, its offbeat humour and cynicism. The cinematography and animations are beautiful but since it was made via CGCIs it's a bit hard to understand why they would want to make it look like it's stop-motion. As for the scenario, the story is well thought-out but goes maybe a bit all over the place — especially at the end —, you barely could have handled even 15 minutes more. All in all, great success for this first opus about the Lego world.","

"lisafordeay","21 July 2014","The Lego Movie is a 2014 animated comedy based on the famous Lego. I didn't get the chance to see this in the Cinemas so I bought it on DVD for my brother who seen it in a friends house and I ended up watching it instead cause my brother had no interest in it since I am a big fan of animated movies ever since I was a kid.The story of this movie is pretty straight-forward. A Lego figurine called Emmett voiced by Chris Pratt is an ordinary figurine who finds it hard to make friends as nobody knows him at all. He of course meets another figurine called Wildstyle(aka Lucy) voiced by Elizabeth Banks and together the two go to different worlds(like in that 2013 flick Wreck It Ralph where Ralph enters different worlds by going into each game)here in this movie they go in by a vortex. Meanwhile an evil villain named Lord Business(aka President Business) voiced by Will Ferrell(who also voiced a villain in Mega Mind and is even in this movie as a father to a kid who built the Lego World,but we don't get to see that until the near end of the movie)is trying to take over the Lego world by destroying it and its up to Emmett who was known as the chosen one to build and create new things to stop the evil villain.In this movie there is a ton of cameos from Batman,Wonder Woman,Superman,Green Lantern,Star Wars,Michealangelo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,Cleopatra and many more in Lego form and there is a few adult jokes in there that the kids won't understand. Bottom line I thought this film was going to be so stupid but I was wrong in fact I think I enjoyed this more than my little brother who wouldn't content himself sitting down AT ALL watching this on DVD with me. If you ever played with Lego or is familiar with Lego than this is for you.If you have kids aged 5 up than this is for you.Or if you are like me a big kid at heart who LOVES animated movies than check it out too.Overall out of 5 its a 4 out of 5 and out of 10 im giving it a 7.","

"g-bodyl","9 February 2015","The Lego Movie is an innovative, fresh take on an animated feature. I would never guess that a movie with such a terrible premise and an excuse to sell more Legos would turn out to be such an entertaining, fun film. It has an infectious nature thanks to the rapid pace, involvement of some of our favorite characters, and the hit song, ""Everything Is Awesome."" The animation is brilliant and I liked the characterizations. Not every joke worked, but the majority thankfully did. Phil Lord's and Christopher Miller's film is about an ordinary citizen named Emmett who is now charged with saving the universe from the destruction of Lord Business after he is seen as the most extraordinary person in the world. The film has a great voice cast filled with likable actors. Nowadays, Chris Pratt is a major star and he has this movie to thank as it's the beginning for what is to come. Will Ferrell once again delivers a funny performance as the villainous Lord Business. We also get good voice acting from the likes of Elizabeth Banks, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman. Overall, The Lego Movie is a clever film that is way better than every right it had to be. The pace may be intense for some, but it's such a lively, entertaining movie. It'a a shame the Oscars snubbed the movie, because it at least deserves a nomination for Best Animated Feature. Instead of being a film designed for commercialization, it turned out to be top-tier entertainment. Everything is indeed awesome! I rate this film 9/10.","

"ArchonCinemaReviews","8 January 2015","The Lego Movie is an animated film that's like Legoland theme park vomited and then tried to cram as many pop culture references as possible.The Lego Movie was one of those films that I had no desire to watch because it looked beyond stupid – and I'm adult enough to admit I was hugely mistaken.Emmet is a completely ordinary construction worker in Lego city who gets mixed up in an epic journey to save the free Lego-world. Somehow he gets mistaken for the prophesied Special and is recruited as the one true savior from an evil mastermind's plot for Lego universe domination.The Lego Movie is proof that commitment to and passion for your craft.just kidding! Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have mastered the quirky referential comedy down to a science with the same unexpected vigor experienced from 21 & 22 Jump Street. The Lego Movie is fresh, smart and new rather than following the standard expected by family oriented films set to capitalize on a franchise and rake in the dough. It satiates entertaining children and adults equally the with seamless duality that can only come from true dedication to storytelling.At first glance, The Lego Movie is a fun family-friendly adventure film. It is also a cheeky satire to those intellectuals able to catch the never-ending barrage and chronic lampooning in the form of cultural references. Every single sentence within the dialogue of this film is an exploited opportunity to parody anything and everything.With such an underwhelming year for animated films, The Lego Movie is the stand-out winner. It may be a bit too manic for some viewers, but that's okay because everything is awesome! Please check out our website for all the recent releases, reviewed in full.","

"kaboler","25 March 2014","I went to see this movie because of all the good reviews, and you were all wrong.They took bits and pieces of hit movies and turned them Lego. The action scenes are borrowed from Transformers (messy action) and Avengers (messy flying fights).It's a boring movie. It's more forced laughter than anything. There are a few cute scenes, but that's about it. I don't really understand how this movie has such good marks.Kids watched the action, because it would jump from scene to scene with startling madness, and the hit song of the movie is catchy mainly because the movie has nothing else that is.You like it because the marketing machine owns you. Will Ferrell-type humour abounds. I mean, look at People Who Liked This Also Liked: ...Anchorman 2, escapist title, escapist title, escapist title, escapist title, escapist title... etc etc etc.Before this, we watched Frozen, which was fantastically better, more funny, and beautiful and heart-touching at times. Skip Lego.This movie would be better if it was called ""The Corporation Movie"" and was about how well the corporation serves junk on a silver platter, and people eat it up.","

"Floated2","29 March 2015","The Lego Movie has been cult well among many fans, as a great visual experience, and the film can be seen as living to its expectations. It might seem like a reach to base a film essentially on a series of plastic blocks, but this 3D animated comedy has some visual inspiration behind it, even if the big laughs aren't quite plentiful enough to carry a feature-length production. The story essentially follows the misadventures of Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), an ordinary Lego construction worker who stumbles on to a diabolical attempt at world domination by President Business (Will Ferrell) and his henchmen led by a two-faced cop (Liam Neeson). So Emmet turns from social outcast to unlikely hero as he teams with Batman's girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) and a blind man (Morgan Freeman) who dispenses pearls of wisdom in an effort to save the day. Overall, a very well made film which has been in production for several years back.","

"capone666","9 June 2014","The Lego MovieThe worst thing about a Lego movie is that you are eventually going to step on it in your bare feet one day.Fortunately, this animated adventure comes in a digital format.Dimwitted construction worker Emmet (Chris Pratt) is bonded with an item that can prevent Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from freezing the folks of Bricksburg in place.Aiding him is a wizard (Morgan Freeman), a master-builder (Elizabeth Banks), Batman (Will Arnett) and other trademarked characters (Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Alison Brie, Charlie Day, Nick Offerman).In order to beat Lord Business though, Emmet must tap into his underutilized imagination.Lampooning the very building blocks that inspired it - and the pop culture licenses it's parent company holds - The Lego Movie is unlike any other: it's uproarious irreverence is equaled only by its narrative's relevance.And in the end, Lego all goes to the same place: inside the couch.

"Andy-296","9 February 2014","A very entertaining, wildly imaginative animated film based on a seemingly terrible material: the Danish brand of toy interlocking bricks. Emmet is an everyman construction worker who works for the Octan Corporation, the only company in the very conformist Legoland and whose president is the evil Lord Business (for a movie that includes a brand in its title, its tone is surprisingly anti corporate). When Emmet unexpectedly finds a piece called the Piece of Resistance (whom a Gandalf-like wizard called Vitruvius has prophesied would be found by the chosen one who would overthrow the tyranny of Lord Business), he is sought by the henchmen of Lord Business, while he is helped in his escape by the rebel girl Wildstyle. Funny and entertaining (the movie includes an extended part of a Lego Batman), surprisingly profound at times (the movie in some way is a paean to common man Emmet) and with nods to such films as The Truman Show and The Matrix. The dazzling computer animation and the intelligent script help a lot. Among the actors giving voice to the animated characters are Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman. Towards the end, two human actors (including Ferrell) appear to give the plot a tight ending.","

"KGinColo","11 April 2014","Some of the other reviewers have said it better than I can, but here goes... This movie is just plain awful. I played with Legos as a kid. I saw that this movie had very high ratings. I had high expectations. I was sorely disappointed. This is one of the worse movies I've ever seen.First of all, the movie just seemed to start, with no opening credits, no title sequence. Maybe the theater messed it up, I don't know, but for the first two or three minutes, I didn't know if the movie had actually started.Second, how can you build any suspense when there are no rules to reality? The characters apparently can't die. Whenever a character gets into a fix, they just grab some Legos and build something to get out of it. Driving down a road and meet a police roadblock? Then just morph into an airplane. Enter a room surrounded by bad guys? Just beat them all up and tear them to pieces.The movie moves at such a fast pace, you don't have time to stop and catch your breath. The jokes were firing one after the other so fast, you didn't have time to stop to laugh. There was no comedic timing! And then the end was so (as others have said) heavy-handed. Ugh.I would have left the theater half-way through, except I couldn't leave my children.So disappointed.","

"acidnat","18 December 2014","With LEGO toys, it was about imagination. Make them move, make them fight, have your own stories, have your own ending...where we had to move them ourselves...speak for them ourselves. For me, that was 25 years ago. Now when I see it, I'm reminisced a little bit of those days...but the whole story is not grabbing enough. Everything is predictable...but then again, the stories I imagined 25 years ago were also predictable now. If you are a true LEGO fan and still buy them for yourself or the kids...you'd totally enjoy it...the animation and characters are true LEGO style. And with the trademarks they can use they've done a fun but 'not-so-great' job.At my age, I'd think they could do a lot more with the licensing they have...but if I saw this 20 years ago...I'd definitely be mind boggled!! I am remembering my childhood days when watching the Flame animation and faces...but its not enough to rate it at par with the all the other wonderful animated movies I have seen this year. For a fact... if you have never ever played with LEGO toys, there are tonnes of better stuff out there...which I personally would say you should watch...with a little bit of Google assistance.","

"uroshnor54","10 August 2014","Maybe 3/10 is a bit harsh. I realize The Lego Movie is just for kids. But if so many adults can praise it, then I suppose an adult should be able to criticize it. I really disliked its style of humor. It's just pop culture references and random stuff. The jokes come too fast, which gave me the impression that the writer's lacked confidence. A confident writer would take time to setting up a joke and delivering the payoff. Watching this movie, I thought the writers weren't too sure which jokes would work and threw everything they could on the screen. And with all due respect to the animators, who I'm sure worked very hard on the movie, it looked rather garish to me.","

It was something that, at that time, no one had really seen before.Knock it off with some funny jokes that even teens and adults can have a laugh at, it was a fun movie for everyone and anyone.

"godzilla_6000","4 July 2014","SMALL SPOILER AT THE END, but it's really nothing to worry about.So, basically, from nowhere this movie shows suddenly shows up, and I'm thinking this will be just the commonly considered ordinary good/average kids-movie of the year, but it doesn't quite turn out that way, something's not right. People suddenly starts to over-hype the film and calling it a ""masterpiece"" and ""the greatest animation"" and such. I see a trailer of the movie in the theatre and think it looks weird but interesting. I decide not to watch it in theatres, and after watching it online it appears I was pretty much right in not wasting my money on this film. Now I'm gonna say this: I liked the film, as I'm a Lego-fan since childhood and thought it was really funny and promoted a good message. BUT, as the title says, this movie is HEAVILY overrated and not at all deserving of all the praise it has got at this point.Seriously, 96% approval at Rotten Tomatoes? I'm not really the type that cares a lot about online ratings, but SERIOUSLY?! (the reviewers at Rotten Tomatoes REALLY needs a slap to the face as a wake-up call) Honestly, I'm thinking like a lot of other people, this film is just famous for the moment and will be practically forgotten by the end of the year. It's really startling to think people would actually see this film more than one or two times and call it better than the greatest animated film (aswell as THE greatest film ever) made; the Oscar-winning masterpiece Frozen. No, ""The Lego Movie"" does not live up to its hype at all. ""Everything is awesome"", yeah (kinda catchy tune by the way, but it's no ""Let It Go""), but there's no chance this film is anything like a ""masterpiece"". But I guess, being a kids-movie, I guess the film's success/praise should be treated from this perspective. Bottom line, it's a good, funny, and entertaining movie (not great), I enjoyed it, but it's very, very overrated, and I'm expecting this to end very soon. By the way: ""SPACESHIP! SPACESHIP!! SPACESHIP!!!"" Could be the most hilarious moment in the whole movie.","

"Reno-Rangan","17 June 2014","3D animation is a new thing in the cinema world. Just the two decades old technology, which started with 'Toy Story'. So as it is young, filmmakers utilizing it very awesomely to create great stuffs. So far we had seen the many wonders of classical tales such as 'Tangled', 'Frozen' et cetera, as well based on the modern subjects like, 'Cars', 'Turbo' et cetera. Here it comes one more movie that specially made referring gaming object like the recent one 'Wreck-It-Ralp'.I loved 'Wreck-It-Ralp', but the fact is that I was not in favour of this movie. Expected it gonna bomb at the box office, then surprised me with the result and made very curious. I knew characters in the form of Lego bricks are easy to animate, we can say just like the stop-motion animation, but it won't give smooth pleasurable flow. That truly bothered me over this movie. Once I began to watch within a few minutes I got adjusted with it so comfortable and enjoyed completely.The story of an ordinary construction worker, Emmet and his unexpected journey towards saving the world. He was accompanied by the great fighters and warriors and superheroes. He has to find the secret plan of villainous leader who controls the land of Lego and must defeat him. To know that you must watch the movie.It is a nice movie, though the story is not fresh. Kind of spoof which imitates recent past movies like 'The Lord of the Rings', Chris Nolan's Batman movie and many others. Especially all the famous characters from various movies had the cameos. It was so fun having them together in one place. So it is not the story, but the way of story telling was so innovative and modern and that showed this movie to the gate of success.I remember I had the best time building something with these Lego bricks in my childhood. All those memories came alive after watching this just like I remembered during 'Wreck-It-Ralp'. It is such a cute movie with fun characters. A smart movie for all age group. I am very much sure it will be one the strongest contender for the next edition of the Oscar ceremony. At present I am not seeing any other equally good ones so who know it may win, but have to wait for another 6 months to know that.","

"hellraiser7","27 February 2014","Legos were always one of my favorite toys as a kid, the beauty of them is the amount of creative freedom you have, you can just build anything you imagine.This film was a dream come true for me, it was one of those films that you wouldn't think would happen but it did and I'm glad for that. Like a well built Lego configuration everything works well.The animation is fantastic, everything is CGI but they all look real, just the amount of detail and color. I love how the Lego world/universe is created each of them are unique and different, which makes sense since there are dozens of sets. My favorite one is the one in the clouds which is the fun but weird utopia, just seeing these things showed a fantasy world/universe with endless possibilities where anything can happen. I also love how there is always a lot happening in the background, it's sort of like with the illustration art in the ""Where's Waldo"" books; it would probably take more than one watch just to see it all.But to me what I really love is the movements which looks like stop motion, and it fits well let alone adds to the humor and fun. It makes sense they would move stop motion like because Lego Figurines have a limited amount of movement except for the vehicles.The music is great, some of the songs are memorable, the one that really sticks out is the song ""Everything is Awesome"" indeed it is.I like the story it's a simplistic fantasy plot on good guys and bad in a race to clam a certain object which could destroy the world and a chosen one can turn the tide. Yeah it's that simple but that what I love about it, it doesn't make itself too complicated for it's own good, but just sticks to being what it should be fun.The voice cast is just excellent, each of them really fit like a glove for their roles. From the villain Lord Business played well by Will Ferrell, he's a fun villain that I don't feel is really evil but his head is in the wrong place. His goal is simply to create a perfect world, but he can't see clearly the corrupt nature of his actions and that perfection is possible but unknowable.Supporting Characters are great, Wyldstyle played by Elizabeth Banks is great she's the typical fem fatale heroine whom is true to his name. A woman of action, super creative from how fast she can built vehicles, but also deep down she is a softy but is a bit insecure in showing it.Liam Neeson is just great as Good Cop/Bad Cop whom is kinda a ""Dr.Jecell and Mr.Hide"" like character. His voice acting was great I really bought both sides were two different people but also that he's actually funny. However two of my favorite characters are Batman played well by Will Arnett. I'm so psyched that they made this DC superhero a characters since he's my favorite comic book hero. Anyway I really love how they make him the usual super cool can as usual kick some ass but also is dryly comical from some of what he says and his exaggerated mannerisms, he's as funny as the Adam West Batman.But my favorite character is Emmitt played with hilarity and charm by Chris Pratt; which is cool since I'm a ""Parks and Recreation"" fan and Andy is my second favorite character. He kinda plays that same character Andy but on a more lighter and less cruder note. It's just funny how bright he really is despite his life not being so great he doesn't let it get him down. This also makes him a sypmpathic character because he doesn't really have friends, but that's because no one really knows him which is something I can emphasize with and all the more makes you want to bet on him. It's also funny how he's at first not the brightest bulb, and we literally see his brain has nothing in it. But he's capable of having ideas which seems like a stupid idea at first but it surprising comes into use, it shows he might be onto something. And also has a big heart, he not afraid to do what's right but also like the chemistry he has with Wyld Style both have a great back and forth which made be care about both characters more.The humor is just fantastic it would take more than one watch to get it all; from the visual humor to the dialog which is just fraking hilarious it is just crackling with hilarity. There are just lots of memorable lines from not just main and supporting characters but even characters that make cameos. And there are tons of visual reference jokes and the cameo voices with them. From other DC Characters like Superman (Channing Tatum), Green Lanturn (Joanah Hill), and Wonder Woman (Cobbie Smothers). But one reference that I thought was comic gold was the ""Star Wars"" reference, I'll let you see that one for yourself.Even the action is great, there are some battle sequences that are well choreographed and a lot of fun. I really love the moments when they all just build vehicles or turn things into vehicles almost as fast as the Autobots and Deceptacons transform into vehicles and robots. My favorite building transformation is Emmett whom creates which I think is an awesome mecha that is a homage to the power loader in ""Aliens"".But the film has heart because it has some good messages on the importance and beauty of creativity, not conforming, the proper use of order, being yourself, but also simply believing in yourself.It's always the simplest idea that can create the greatest things.Rating:4 stars","

"stevendbeard","8 February 2014","I saw ""The Lego Movie"", starring the voices of Chris Pratt-Parks and Recreation-t.v., Jennifer's Body; Elizabeth Banks-The Hunger Games movies, Pitch Perfect; Will Arnett-The Millers-t.v., Arrested Development-t.v.; Morgan Freeman-Last Vegas, The Bucket List and Will Ferrell-The Anchorman movies, Old School.This is the first big screen Lego movie-there have been others, but they were straight to video-and it was better than I was expecting it to be. It was good fun for the adults and the kids, with plenty of jokes for everyone to enjoy. Everything is made to look like it is made from Legos, even the water, fire and the smoke effects. There are lots of recognizable Lego creations-and a few other licensed characters-that make an appearance, including some of my favorite super heroes. Will F. plays the villain that wants to use an artifact called the Kragle to destroy the Lego universe. Morgan is a wise old sage that passes out advice and knows about a secret artifact that can stop Will F.'s dastardly plans, but he needs a special person. Chris plays an ordinary engineer, striving to become a Master Builder, that tears up buildings and then builds them back, good as new. Elizabeth comes to the conclusion that Chris is the chosen one from Morgan's visions and decides to help him achieve his true potential on a quest to stop Will F.. Will A. plays Batman, Elizabeth's boyfriend. There is a scene with a live actor, near the end, that uses one of the voice actors. It's rated ""PG"" for mild violence and rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.","

"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","12 April 2014","My Thoughts: I really enjoyed this movie. And I think E-Roc, an avid Lego collector/fan and member of The Awesome Movie Podcast, seemed to enjoy himself greatly. I am sure the next time we record for The Awesome Movie Podcast, he will let us know what he thought of the movie so, be sure to check it out.What are you getting when you go to see this movie? We start off seeing Lord Business (Will Ferrell) taking on Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) and stealing the artifact Kragle (I will let you guys figure out what that is). We then flash forward to 8 1/2 years later and we follow Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt), a construction worker that is just a normal guy, following the instructions set forth by President Business. And yes, he is the same guy as Lord Business now, just running the show with his robot Legos and cameras everywhere.Emmet stumbles upon Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) searching for the one relic that can stop Lord Business and his evil plans to use the Kragle. Emmet is mistaken to be the Special and is taken on an adventure with Wyldstyle, learning that there is life outside of the instructions that he follows. Along the way, he teaches the ""Master Builders"" that there is more to life then just thinking outside the box and coming together to help take down Lord Business and stop his evil plans.This movie has a deeper meaning to it as well, but I am not going to delve to much into it because it will give away some big reveals towards the end of the movie, and I think people should be surprised and learn what it is on their own. Needless to say, though, this movie will speak to both the kids and the parents or adults that go see this movie.To say there are a lot of big named actors doing voice overs is an understatement. This movie is chocked full of A-list Actors lending their voices to the characters, and they are all awesome! I didn't once glance down at my watch wondering when this movie would end. There is plenty of humor and entertainment for kids and adults alike.I am always worried going into these types of movies, not knowing how kids are going to behave or whether the parents are going to control them if they start to get rowdy. I have to say, this movie seems to have captured their attention and hold it for the hour and forty-minute run time. There weren't any crying kids, nor distracted kids; they all seemed to pay attention to the movie and really enjoy it. So if you are wondering if you should take your kid to see this movie, I say yes, go for it.And let me tell you before I go, there are tons of little Easter eggs throughout this movie, and you probably won't catch them all going through the first time.My Recommendation: I think this is a great movie for the family. There is plenty for the adults, and it will keep kids entertained. If you are a big Lego fan, I think you should see this movie as well.","

"Animated_Antic","14 August 2017","I have always hated the term ""Hollywood has run out of ideas"". Whenever I hear it, it's usually regarding to a movie clearly based off a property that shouldn't be turned into a movie, particularly ones based on games and toys. Movies based on them (with the exception of ""Toy Story"" of course) have barely worked with one notable example being the 2012 film ""Battleship"". So when I first saw the trailer for ""The Lego Movie"", I rolled my eyes and thought that this movie would never work. And you'll be very surprised when I say that I was proved completely wrong. ""The Lego Movie"" really surprised me with its clever humor, heartwarming story, memorable characters, and some fantastic animation. Yes, you read that right. ""I was actually surprised by The Lego Movie"" and I'll explain why.The film takes places in a world made out of Lego filled with many mini figures. In the big city, a normal construction worker named Emmet (Chris Pratt) lives in an average every day normal life following the instructions to a good life. One day though, he accidentally stumbles across the legendary Piece of Resistance, one of the elements of a prophecy that would be used to take down the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell). He then is thrown into a giant war after he is rescued from custody by Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks) who he accidentally believes to be the prophecy's chosen one. Traveling through many worlds in the Lego universe, its up to Emmet, Wildstyle, the prophesier Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and even Batman (Will Arnett) to defeat Lord Business and his lieutenant Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) before they unleash the ultimate weapon to destroy the world, the Kragle (which is really krazy glue with a worn out label). I can't say anymore, you just have to see it.The strength in this film is definitely the writing. Both Phil Lord and Chris Miller clearly understood the fun of Legos and were able to craft up a world with original characters and comedy that even pokes fun of clichés seen in the past. One notable example is the villain telling his minions to cue his dramatic entrance using smoke and a door slamming open. Writing like this is what makes ""The Lego Movie"" stand out. The animation is fantastic. What really surprised me about it was the fact that it was actually not stop motion like I initially thought, but computer animation. The film was animated by Animal Logic, the company that crafted the realistic movies like ""Happy Feet"" and ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"". The fact that they went from making animals looking very lifelike to simple toys is a pretty big leap and an impressive leap at that. The characters were a whole bunch of fun. Each had at least one to funny line to say, and had at least one unique trait to make them stand out. They also were perfectly cast as well. Chris Pratt brought a real lovable presence to Emmet while Will Arnett cracked me up with his cocky and s egotistical performance as Batman. Will Ferrell even channeled his early performance of ""Megamind"" in his performance of Lord Business. If I had one problem with the movie and it's pretty much a nitpick is some of the humor was a little off. Most of it hit the mark, but some I just didn't catch or it was funny. However, it's really a nitpick.""The Lego Movie"" is probably one of the most surprising movies I have seen. With a funny story, fantastic animation and memorable characters, I was left in a very happy mood, something I never thought I would say about ""The Lego Movie"". I hope that movie studios will take notes on how to make movies based on properties really good, because this movie set the bar very high which can be seen as either a good thing or a bad thing. I think that it's a good thing.","

"rcolgan","29 April 2014","The LEGO movie is nothing short of a delight to watch from start to finish. It's an example of a great idea for a film executed extraordinarily with great animation, hilarious writing and cameo after cameo after cameo.The story follows as a random builder who is believed to be the special who is needed to take down Lord Business and bring freedom to the world once more. The story reflects how LEGO is always played. You'll have those who want to make everything their way and then you'll have those who just want to have fun and build in the world of LEGO. The story really goes to show this adding some really interesting drama alongside the comedy that you'll be able to relate to no matter how old you are.The animation is just the right style mixing both stop motion with a lot of computer animation giving the film not only a distinct look but also well suited for the Lego franchise reminding me a little of the old Lego Star Wars games and how they move so quickly and comedic. Besides that it also creates some great designs that will make you feel like a kid again with the beautiful worlds ranging from the wild west to an epic space adventure, something which Lego is all so perfect to do.Then there's the main thing that separates this film apart from just about every other film in that it gratifies our fantasies by having some of the greatest characters come together. We get to see Superman, Michaelangelo, Batman, Abe Lincoln and so many more random brilliant characters on screen together. There are so many great cameo characters in this film that it makes Wreck it Ralph seem like a generic reference. So many cameos within the film keep you entertained non stop, with each one more entertaining than the last. The only fault with them being that you love them so much that you want to see even more, but when the only fault is that you want more of what's there, that's no real fault.The best way to phrase it is that it's an incredible idea that has been executed brilliantly. The premise is a tough one to pull off right, but clearly it's been done right here creating one of the funniest, most heart warming and fantastic animated films with a style that stands out and separates it from all the other animation franchises. They've already announced a sequel and I am already looking forward to seeing it.","

"leonblackwood","20 July 2014","Review: For some unknown reason, I really enjoyed this funny movie. It really does have something for everyone and although the storyline is completely ridiculous, it really did make me laugh. There is a great mixture of characters and the references to other movies were well written. I was shocked to see the cast list and I was amazed that Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman agreed to do this movie because it's completely out of there character. The originality of the film was refreshing and the directors done well by making all the Lego characters actually look the Lego. The annoying ""Awesome"" song made me laugh and Batman was a great addition to the many different characters. In all, I was surprised with the outcome, after hearing all of the hype behind the movie, and judging by the money that it took at the box office, I'm not the only one that thought that this was a great watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman have to have the two most striking voices in cinema. I couldn't really tell who Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was but it was good to see that the director used the real Billy Dee William and Shaquille O'Neal. Will Ferrell was great in person and his voice as Lord Business really did work. Don't get me wrong, the movie is extremely far fetched and the concept was crazy, but that is what makes the movie work. They have already planned a sequel, which isn't surprising after that gross, and as soon as I saw this movie, I put the Batman Lego movie straight on my rental list. I honestly think that you will see something new every time that you watch this film because there is so much going on and the pace is quite fast. I haven't been that impressed with a lot of animated movies that have come out recently but after watching this film, my faith has truly been restored.Budget: $60million Worldwide Gross: $468million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there heroic animated movies about a everyday construction worker who has been told that he has a gift to save the world. 7/10","

Me and my sister got bored of this movie after 30 minutes when we saw it in theaters so we left. But I decided to give it a second chance today, and I thought it was terrible. The movie is very cliché. The villain didn't feel threatening at all, and it was a cliché villain. The jokes were repetitive.I had absolutely no feelings for the characters. I found them all annoying and trying to be funny but failed. And the ending was horrible.I would recommend not seeing this movie unless you have a kid that would want to see it. since this movie is for kids and only kids will laugh at it. Most grown adults will find it boring. All my friends found it boring. If you want to see a good animated adult like movie, watch how to train your dragon","

"muhammadalinajfi","19 March 2014","At first glance this movie does not look like it should be appealing. It looks like an advertisement for some toys, or to reboot a franchise. However, it turns out to be possibly the best animated movie of all time. After seeing this movie, my siblings would not stop reenacting the movie with toys, playing the video games, etc. The film is extremely funny and charming and jokes are timed so well that it looks like a beautiful piece of art. The characters are so separate and unique that their ""gang"" looks like the new toy story gang. The movie starts off a bit slow, to edge you into the movie, and sooner or later you'll be in love with all the surprises and events you didn't know could possibly happen in a Lego based movie. Overall, The Lego Movie is like the perfect animated movie to me.","

"sohansurag","19 April 2014","Remember those times when you were a kid and used to make dramatic, action packed movies playing with your action figures and toys? Lego movie does just that, just much better than an 8 year old though. I'll put this right there, I am not a fan of Lego! I had a wannabe Lego set when I was young (Thank you, China!) and later on I did have my own authentic legos as well but I just couldn't get what all the hype was about. They started making video games on every other franchise out there and I never touched one and when the news came that these guys were upto making a full length animated Lego movie, I was rolling my eyes. So when it finally released, I thought to give it a shot. Well I couldn't possibly ignore the rave reviews, could I?From directors, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller who previously gave us the uproarious 21 Jump Street comes Lego Movie. I was in as soon as I heard these two names were attached with the Lego project. You also have to count Cloudy with a Chance of meatballs which was some pure entertainment for kids and adults alike. Lego Movie tells the story of Emmett who's a hapless construction worker, a nobody, who's taken on the ride of his lifetime when he stumbles on an artifact. Joining his adventure is the ravishing Wyldstyle and the wizard Vitruvius and spanning across a wide range of Lego universes. From DC Universe and Star Wars to Lord of The Rings and TMNT and then some more.Brilliant animation which is actually computer animated but made to look like its stop motion and has been maintained till end. I started searching if there were anything not made out of legos and I was surprised to find none, even the water, fire and smoke was made out of legos (There were of course some 'relics' which was obviously real world things). The 3rd act was what surprised me. And I liked the inclusion of.you know what? I'll let you have that surprise. It might not work for some but I am glad it did for me. And that inclusion made all the difference, it was that stroke of sheer genius that made Lego movie from being good to 'awesome'.Brilliantly voiced characters enlivens the screen and some big names are attached as well. From Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson, to Will Farrel and Elizabeth Banks. You of course get Chris Pratts amazingly voiced lead Emmett and makes the character adorable and endearing. But the real show stealer? Batman. I laughed hard every other gag the Batman was involved, and all thanks to Will Arnett's perfect voice over.My only qualm about the movie was that it would have been perfect in 2D, the me-too 3D feature kinda trampled the experience to some degree. In the end I am still am not a fan of the toys but I've convinced myself to become a fan of the franchise, both the games and movies. With splendidly written characters, fast paced and humorous narrative, and excellent voice overs, The Lego Movie promises truckloads of fun. It could have all been a 100 minute promotion for Lego, a huge ad for Lego considering the movie has squeezed in everything they could and what results is not a convoluted piece of junk but a good movie which offers true entertainment.","

"freemantle_uk","17 February 2014","Before The Lego Movie was released it was easy scoff at the idea and dismiss the film before its release. But the reviews have offered near universal praise from critics and audiences, making a film that is fun and funny and more intelligence then it had any right to be. 21 Jump Street writers/directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller take the clichéd mistaken messiah storyline by making The Lego Movie more about conformity, individuality and creatively and takes a Plato's Allegory of the Cave approach as the main character lives a sheltered, limited experience and sees the world for what it really is. The Lego Movie is filled with jokes and visuals gags that both adults and children can enjoy as the directors are inventive with their set-pieces and designs. There is excellent voice from the likes of Chris Pratt and Elizabeth Banks. Will Arnett as Batman was comedy gold, playing on the popularity of the character.","

"drqshadow-reviews","3 July 2015","Far more fun than the concept really had any right to be, braving new horizons while still remaining loyal to the beating heart of the product and its passionate generations of fans. Simply enough, this is a perfect encapsulation of the kind of imagination, enthusiasm, adaptation and sheer randomness that runs like lifeblood through the spirit of a happy childhood. It jabs in delightfully unexpected directions. It bends physics without an explanation (nor a need for one). It casually hops from one licensed fantasy to another, mashing Green Lantern with Gandalf, and doesn't even slow down to consider the repercussions. At the best of times, I felt like I was a kid again myself, lost in nostalgia and the infinite potential locked away within every new block. And while the last act overreaches in an effort to really hammer the morals home, otherwise this is pretty much a direct hit. Crafty, funny writing, a dazzling array of vocal talent and a playful, distinct visual style - this is the kind of family film I can always make room for.","

"Geeky Randy","4 December 2014","This critically and commercially successful film based on Lego construction toys follows ordinary man Pratt who has been prophesized as being the universe's savior from tyrant Farrell. The dialogue could have been better written to work around the kid-friendliness (one too many uses of ""butt"" and ""darn""), but laughs will come from all ages. The film is surprisingly unpredictable, with the story taking a very interesting turn towards the third act. No one can deny the movie's heartwarming message or that ""everything is awesome""! Anthony Daniels actually voices C-3PO.***½ (out of four)","

"runamokprods","16 January 2015","One of my very favorite films of 2014. What I worried would be a feature length commercial is instead a very funny, and somewhat subversive film, overflowing with ideas, puns, perfect music, and wacky 'cameos' by everyone from Shaquile O'Neil, to a wonderfully warped and dark Batman (given terrific voice by Will Arnet). 'Lego' doesn't look quite like any film I've seen before. It has a rough, almost bizarrely low- tech look to it's Lego people -- stop motion that looks like stop motion --oddly (but very effectively) combined with mind-blowingly huge and complicated shots of the Lego universe in action. Somehow in the unlikely mix of slickness and lo-fi something wonderful is created; animation that is wildly impressive, but also clearly human, creative and DIY at the same time.The film is basically a spoof of every Hollywood vision-quest movie you've ever seen. You know the films. A young character (almost always male) is called on to save the world/neighborhood/kingdom. He's over-matched, and under prepared, but with a kindly older mentor of great power to guide him, you know he will find a way to prevail. Except here the ""special"" character at the center really ISN'T very special. He's a young working guy like a million others, who's not very bright or especially brave, and who just wants to live his happy, blank, endlessly repetitive safe life. And the mentor? None other than the voice of Morgan Freeman, expertly spoofing his own image as the ultimate voice of wisdom. He plays a wizard who is far less consistently brilliant and all knowing than he claims or wants to be. He's very, very funny, which is not the first thing one thinks of with Morgan Freeman. The same could be said of Liam Neeson, who also does a great voice job as the good cop/bad cop, who's personality changes depending on what side of his head is facing front. Will Ferrell is also excellent as the villain of the piece, being just silly enough to be funny, but just real enough to give the story some real tension. Not everything works, and there were a few spots near the end where the energy flagged. But overall this is an exciting and creative (and wonderfully fun) piece of film-making, that manages to attack the near fascist mentality of a society obsessed with consuming, and determined not to question it's own lives (it's not for nothing that the villain's name is 'President Business')-- while still being very funny, and almost never feeling like its preaching. And without giving anything away, in the last 20 minutes it changes the rules again, and asks a few profound questions about the nature of existence, without seeming like it had suddenly jumped the track as a film for kids as well as adults.In the end, I walked around with the hysterical, awful (in a great way), and when you think about it kinda dark anthem ""Everything is Awesome"" banging around in my head for days.","

"TheMarwood","30 December 2014","The Lego Movie is an odd blend of energy and color wrapped around a paper thin narrative. Most of the film is an unhinged series of very busy visuals with lots and lots of noise - stimulation overkill. I could imagine the psychotic effects this would have on a child watching before bedtime, possibly something along the lines of the child ingesting Strychnine and a bottle of No-Doze. The Lego Movie can be an exhausting film to watch, but more often than not, the film is charming enough without pandering to children. It does transcend its corporate shackles, in what could have easily been a feature length toy commercial in lesser hands, but Phil Lord and Christopher Miller give enough soul to this material. The film is a lot easier to enjoy on a visceral level, as these silly lego characters don't really engage and the voice work is well cast and deliver their readings with enough wit. While not exactly deep subversive satire, The Lego Movie does have just enough substance beneath all the noise.","

"Fluke_Skywalker","4 July 2014","Creativity and ingenuity may be in short supply in live-action Hollywood films these days, but that's certainly not the case in animation, as 'The Lego Movie' proves. With wit, charm, humor and adventure to spare, it manages that rarest of feats; truly being fun for all ages.The animation here is just incredible. It really is like your Legos come to life. And with the aid of its top-notch voice cast and clever script, you soon forget that you're watching a film about little plastic bricks.If you want a film with the fun built in, look no further than 'The Lego movie'.","

"aidanratesmovies","31 May 2021","It's amazing how something as simple as LEGO's an make for a great animated movie, but somehow it does. I've loved this film since the very first viewing- and each time I watch it I find something new out of it. It's easily one of the best animated films of the 2010's- and the fact it was snubbed at the Oscars still hurts to this day. Not only is the animation clean and fun in a way that will continue to age well for many years to come- The LEGO movie itself is just a complete blast from start to finish. Between its stellar all-star cast and the creative minds behind other genius animated flicks and comedies (Phil Lord and Chris Miller)- it's quite amazing we can see a film of such great caliber- that also proves to be unique and incredibly original- despite it being based on a long-running toy brand. There are few flaws I have with the film, but mainly, lke Lord and Miller's other works, the flaws come with the sudden change in tone- it proving to be a bit too dramatic when it doesn't need to be. I feel this film handles it better than there other flicks, but still feels a bit awkward when the joking starts again from its gloomy undertones beforehand. Besides some tonal issues, The LEGO Movie can be quite a hilarious and entertaining ride- and surprisingly it can be quite moving as well. It may not be perfect, but its certainly close.My Rating: 9.9/10.","

"DannyD1997","22 March 2017","Originally, I was expecting this movie to suck, because of the Lego TV shows on Cartoon Network, or maybe it's also because of the straight to video Lego movies, but it didn't suck. It was an absolutely hilarious and awesome movie. They actually poke fun at the clichés, and it works perfectly. It has now also became of my favorite franchises ever. I have always liked the character Emmet after watching this movie, because he's pretty much just like me. I wasn't very creative when it comes to building Legos, and was always following the instructions. Batman was awesome in this movie as well. I have even seen the Lego Batman Movie recently last month, and it too was awesome. I hope the same thing will happen to the Lego Ninjago Movie six more months later. Now, THIS movie feels like if it was influenced by Yellow Submarine. I know this movie was actually inspired by stop-motion Lego brickfilms, but this movie also feels like Yellow Submarine. And yes, Legos are made to move like stop-motion, unless in video games, maybe. But either way, I love the Lego Movie.","

"rannynm","28 March 2014","This is a fast pace action, comedy, that shows that Lego's are more than just plastic bricks. The story is about Emmet (Chris Pratt) who is just an ordinary guy that always follows the instructions. However, once he finds a magical relic, he is now known as the special person who is supposed to defeat Lord Business (Will Ferrell) from launching an evil plan. So with the help of Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), and more hilarious characters, he sets out to save the world.I love this movie! It has a ""Toy Story"" atmosphere to it that makes it entertaining. The writers don't try to hide the fact that the Lego people are plastic figures, they just write it in the way that Lego figures would move and act. Even the characters sort of know what they are, although they don't know everything. The jokes are always thrown at you and all of them get a laugh. It has a parody element to it that is surprisingly funny for kids and adults. When a company that has been around for generations and has so much merchandise, you can't help but admire the creators for making fun of their toy. It does is heart- warming how creativity is important. The animation is marvelous - the way the characters build structures, vehicles and double-decker couches is an experience to see. Just watching this imaginative universe makes me wonder, ""What can't you make out of Legos""?!My favorite character is hard to pick out of dozens of lovable characters. I would have to choose Good Cop / Bad Cop (Liam Neeson). I love this character's double personality and he cracks me up every time I see him.My favorite scene is when Emmet talks to Lord Business about how you don't how to follow the instructions all the time. This scene shows and proves how Legos are important to people. How the simplicity of building a spaceship or anything, can spark inspiration for kids and adults to build. The moral of the story is that everyone is special. Emmet does not think he has the mind or experience to fulfill his prophecy. He soon learns that if you believe in yourself you can do extraordinarily things.I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 5 to18-year-olds. This film reminds us on how Legos can change our lives. We all had Legos once in our lives, whether you follow the instructions, build or just played with them, it does not matter. Legos have been around for generations and these bricks have shown us new worlds to explore and enjoy. This film is timeless and I hope it will be know for a long time.Reviewed by Keefer B. KIDS FIRST Film CriticThis movie is something special. This movie will make kids' dreams come true everywhere. What movie I'm talking about? Well it's ""The Lego Movie"" of course. This great film has comedy, adventure, suspense, music, romance, LEGOS and a great story line. The story is about an unlikely hero, who turns out to be part of a big prophesy and a lot of exciting battles and adventures. But, is this just all a part of a kid's imagination or do Legos truly come to life when we are not looking? I love so many things about this movie! A very unique part is the animation. It's plastic, smooth and looks a lot like real Lego pieces. At parts it feels like its stop motion but it's not. Most of the sets where were made out of hundreds of Legos. Imagine it, five adults playing with a whole bunch of Legos for work. I am sure most kids would wish to be a part of such production. If you add to the mix the voice- overs by amazing actors such as Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett and Will Ferrell – you get an animated film that will captivate your heart for sure.I have a couple of favorite scenes. First, when Batman, Emmet, Wyldstyle, the Wizard and Benny are all stuck in the ocean on a 'double decker couch.' Batman says ""It's not like a gigantic ship will show up"" and right when he says that, a ship comes out of nowhere. Then later, when they need a part and he says ""It's not like there's a spaceship or anything"" and what do you know, the Millennium Falcon drops by! I recommend this movie to ages 2 to 17. Older people may not enjoy the humor as much as younger kids. I also give it 5 out of 5 stars. Reviewed by Gerry O, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews go to kidsfirst dot org.","

"Mysterygeneration","11 January 2024","The Lego Movie, which was co-directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, is an inventive animated film that goes beyond the idea of a toy. The movie centers on Emmet, a construction worker who sets out to overthrow a despicable dictator. The film is notable for its distinctive fusion of humor, inventiveness, and a moving message about individualism and the capacity for imagination. The animation, which is all computer-generated, honors classic Lego toys. The voice cast, which is anchored by Chris Pratt as Emmet, strikes the ideal mix between earnestness and fun. With its sharp wit, pop cultural allusions, and unexpected meta-narrative, the movie appeals to both adults and children. The Lego Movie celebrates play and imagination while being a visual treat.","

"nick-sultana","6 April 2014","The Lego Movie finally arrived in Australian cinemas last week, so I took the chance to see it since having so much high-anticipation since reading IMDb user reviews and the hype it had! I can admit that this was indeed a fun movie to see!The storyline here is obviously children aimed, but I was surprised that so many adults my age and older were interested in this, it felt like too it was aimed at both children and adults. It had humor, imagination, moral and even heart in its tale, delivering a strong feel good feeling of who who we are and what we are capable of. Animation is a major feature in The Lego Movie and I can admit that it was astoundingly achieved by Australian visual effects company Animal Logic (the creative team behind Happy Feet 1 and 2). So much detail and thought was given into the Lego universes featured in the film, it gives a strong sense of what the imagination from the mind can do! The 3D itself gave an amazing sight to behold this amazing Lego world, sure hope in future that Animal Logic wins awards for their hard-earned work (and maybe even Best Animated Film in the 2015 Academy Awards).Overall, an exciting move that takes fun to a whole new level in terms of story, film-making and even genre. Can't wait for the Blu Ray release later this year and the already confirmed sequel in the future.","

"ShelbyTMItchell","10 February 2014","This is such a cute movie. As it shows that hopefully Legos will become more popular. As I have nephews that used to love building them. As we all did as kids.It shows a miniature builder, an ordinary man named Emmett who has very few friends but is a really decent guy. Who obeys the rules and is so by the book that he has no time for a life.But then something happens in which President Lord Business, as he is know, is the antagonist who is trying to destroy the world with something called the Kragle.As he finds a spy named Wyldstyle, trying to stop Lord Business as Emmett originally had really such respect for him. As she and other super heroes, including her ""boyfriend"" Batman and wizard Vitruvius team up to help stop the villain.As they mistaken Emmett for being ""The special"" that can defeat Lord Business. Despite the fact the ordinary construction worker is just an every day man. Will Emmett agree to help out Wyldstyle and the others, or will he find it in his heart to learn that you don't have to have powers to be special, considering that is who he is?Such a cute movie along with a lot of twists and turns along the way! Go take the kids to see it and also adults would enjoy it. Knowing that we as kids played with Legos as it will bring back memories!","

"RevRonster","17 February 2014","When the movie was announced, I was excited. When the first poster was unveiled, I was more excited. When the first trailer hit, I was a rolling ball of excitement ready to split open and engulf all of reality in the spontaneous black hole that developed from all my excitement.I'm a big fan of Lego so, needless to say, my expectations were high for this one. However, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller hit them all and then decided to go further beyond what I was expecting. To put it simply, ""The Lego Movie"" is awesome and might be the best animated film I have ever seen. I can't think of a single element of this film that didn't work. It was, for the lack of a better wordperfect.First off, the voice acting is top shelf stuffworthy of the most complex Lego creation the world has ever seenI'm trying to say the actors were awesome and a perfect fit for their roles (get it? Fit?). Everyone from the characters who only show up for one line to the main stars like Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, Elizabeth Banks, Charlie Day, Will Ferrell, Will Arnett and more, really delivered in not only making the film extremely hilarious but brought their characters to life in a way that made the Lego world feel legit and right out of the imagination of a childor me when my girlfriend works late and I pull out my big box o' Lego.Then there's the fantastic story that takes all the various types of humor the film contains and mixes perfectly with just enough heart and emotion to make the film resonatenot to mention the story itself is just a rich stew of unique creativity that feels like a shining jewel and a beacon of awesome in a world of movies that many are starting to think has become stale and complacent.Finally, the animation is some of the most amazing I've ever seen dance upon the big screen. The way the animators seamlessly married 3D and stop-motion ended up creating a world of Legos that is every Lego fans' dream. The way they were able to make literally everything (fire, smoke, water and more) look like it was made of the greatest toy every created and an object feared by bare feet was just an awesome sight. I could throw all kinds of words to describe how cool the final product looked but words just can't do the animation justice.""The Lego Movie"" is, plain and simple, awesome. The jokes, story, heart and animation come together to make a magical film that is unlike any other animated movie to ever exist. Just like toys, the movie is something that everyone can enjoy and, also like the toy, the scope of what the film delivers and is able to create feels limitless.Hi! My name is Rev. Ron and I love movies! So much so that I write a blog where I review whatever film I am currently watching (Old or new!).

"GeorgeRoots","15 March 2014","Well it happened. After a life time producing these wonderful little bricks dating all the way back to 1949, finally we get to see this toy giant get a movie release (Outside of their works based on popular franchises like ""Batman""). I ASSURE you movies based on toys and cartoons get released yearly, some to mixed reception and few to rave reviews. ""The Lego Movie"" is so beautifully animated and well made, that I was in awe at how personal this film will be to each individual.I don't want to stress or further the message the film was trying to communicate with its audience because they'll easily get it, everyone will. What I do want to say is how much I praise the film-makers for seeing and going beyond the potential of what they could create with the source material. Being a bit older now than I probably would have liked to have seen it, I can say that it got to me not through catchy tunes or semi-funny jokes, but heavy nostalgia and sentimentality. I never had much LEGO growing up, but finally after amassing a large amount at the age of 16 I gave it all away to the son of a family friend who didn't have any. Therefore closing my loop, and looking back at those times with a smile (I still buy the occasional figure or two).Final Verdict: I can't really find a negative thing to say about the movie. The voice acting was stellar, and the animation was fluent and very frenetic at times. Chris Miller and Phil Lord did a very good job incorporating themes of individuality and group mentality, but I just thought that by the end any gender of any age should be able to enjoy this. 10/10. Warner Bros. may have just found their ""Toy Story"".","

"thomas-w15","22 November 2014","The Lego Movie 7.5/10- When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked pretty stupid. I was surprised when I saw it had a 95 on rotten tomatoes. So, I decided to give this movie a chance and could not have been more impressed. Yes, it is funny but the thing that is incredible is the visual effects. It did something that few have done before but it was the first to do it successfully. You do not have to be a four year old to enjoy this. The Lego Movie is something that we all can appreciate. The plot was somewhat cliché but the way it turns towards the end and gives itself a new direction is really impressive and definitely separates itself from other films of its category. T he visual effects were the thing to talk about. It takes a second to get use to but once you do, you become entranced in the world of legos. Also the way they so quickly build legos like it is a video game and putting it on the screen is stunning.The decision to make all of the characters from famous lego sets as characters in the movie was very amusing and the only thing that might have did wrong is not having Harry Potter in it. The rest though such as: Batman, Abe Lincoln, Green Lantern, Superman, etc... all did great job in adding something to the plot. As far as voices go for movies, the Lego Movie did exceptionally well. Then again, with Morgan Freeman being a voice in a movie, it is hard to go wrong. The rest of the cast: Chris Pratt (Emitt), Elizabeth Banks(Wild Style), and Will Arnet(Batman) all did amazing well and I believe the movie would not have been as good with them. Basically, The Lego Movie is a great choice to go see at the movies and will no doubt be in the line up for the Oscars next year.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com","

"nancyldraper","7 February 2019","If you were a Lego builder, you might like the imaginative take on your own imaginative endeavours. If you are a pop culture junkie, you will like the wide variety of characterizations. If you are a movie fan, you won't be disappointed by this cast and their voice work. I think the movie deserves props for its CGI, creative visual imagination, pop culture characterizations and voice work. But I felt they overreached trying to turn ""You Are Special"" into a transformative moral and I found the cutesy factor wore thin as the movie dragged on. I watched this in preparation for its sequel, which opens later today, to see if it would be worth seeing in a theatre. It fell a little flat for me and there was nothing there to interest me in a sequel. I give this film a 6 (fair) out of 10. {Adventure Animation}","

I am a 37 year old who grew up with Legos and STILL loves playing with them! We have all the Lego video games, have watched all the Lego movies, and own tons of Lego bricks. The reviews of this movie are so great, we expected to go in and enjoy every minute.Not so much.The movie was slightly funny. I think I laughed four times. It was moderately enjoyable for our kids, but I think younger kids would enjoy it more. It was boring. In fact, my husband nearly fell asleep. Between that and feeling like I was watching a super long Lego commercial, I have to say I was pretty disappointed. Sorry, I know most people on IMDb don't agree with me on this one, but I just have to share my opinion!","

As a lover of lego the thought of a film set within a lego city was just great. The music in the film is also great, I think the characters too work great for the script, while kids may like this film a lot so will adults I think, it's one of those ones that can bridge the gap. The film is also gorgeous to look at, the colours are beautifully vibrant and bold with a great use of light and shadow in many scenes. Batman as a character was just hilarious in this movie too and a great cross over. The film just seems to have so much charm and love poured into it's making that it completely won me over.","

Not only because the lines and references are so great, but because of the lesson and time it conveys to those of us who grew up with legos. It truly is a heart-felt story for the ages. The comedic value also makes this movie the best kids movie; plus all of the characters are extremely relatable. I have introduced so many people to this movie alone. Lots of wacky characters like Unikitty, Benny, and Metal-beard. Even Batman joins the action. And Everything Is Awesome is one of the best movie songs written. Easily one of the best movies I've ever seen.","

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","4 November 2016","The LEGO Movie, on the surface, seems like a product placement for one of the world's biggest toy-brands; the truth about the movie is that it capitalizes on its heritage and satires the basic premise of capitalism through its character Emit. And The LEGO Movie has a loose but flexible plot that never gets too self-restrained: only when the script says so.This film is a charming, colourful and memorable treat in animated cinema, and the computer-animation is used to emulate stop-motion and I liked how the animation didn't TRY to look like it was done on computers. While it is noticeable that it is CGI, it is done so with memorable style that hardly gets in the way of enjoying what you're watching.The LEGO Movie is an advert for promoting not only toys, but imagination and thinking outside the 'instructions'.Also, Batman is in this movie. So there's that.","

"Matt_Layden","25 February 2014","Emmet is a nobody. He is so normal and boring that even people he thinks are his friends don't remember him. He lives his life by the instructions, but one day he goes off the beaten path and finds himself deemed ""the special one"" by a rebel group hellbent on bringing an end to evil dominance in the land.I had heard of good things from the film, I just didn't expect to cry from laughter. The Lego Movie is my kind of humour, fast paced, sometimes stupid, completely random and chaotic. The Lego Movie is all this wrapped in a beautifully created lego world that will have you smiling at all the little pieces that make up the brilliance of the animation. A must see film that is consistently funny and entertaining from start to finish. Bring the whole family. The story involves in the old tale of an ordinary guy mistaken for some kind of hero, then he learns to trust in himself and finds the courage to become the hero the people thought he originally was. Nothing really new in terms of storytelling, but the presentation, the uniqueness of the art and the witty humour make for one tremendous ride from start to finish. The film feels like it never stops from the get go. Constantly on hyper speed, the pace never drags and the kids will never be bored. Filled to the brim with voice acting, Chris Pratt leads the film with Elizabeth Banks playing the romantic interest. Supporting roles include Will Arnett, Morgan Freeman, Charlie Day, Allison Brie, Nick Offerman, Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson and dozens of others in smaller cameo roles all fit the bill nicely. The imaginative landscape is truly inspiring here. Thrust into different lego worlds we'll be in the Wild West at one point, then stuck on a Pirate Ship the next. Despite the film being entirely CGI, you'll swear to yourself that half the film must have been done with actual legos. The attention to detail is awe inspiring. The Lego Movie is indeed hilarious and a must see. It's early in the new year, but I expect this to be the best animated film this year. Can't wait for the sequel.","

"The_Film_Cricket","8 February 2014","""The LEGO Movie"" is a happy and exhilarating ball of fun. It's a bright, colorful, quick-witted adventure that stretches the animated form as far as it can possibly go, spinning its characters into other dimensions and other realms. In short, it does exactly what animation is supposed to do. It plays around in a magical world but doesn't simply ground itself in one simple-minded idea. This is one of those rare homeruns that comes along every once in a great while. It follows ground-breakers like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""Toy Story"", in that the animators open the visual canvas to create something really special and distinct.The story takes place in a world completely constructed out of LEGO, beginning with a breathtaking opening shot that swoops through downtown Brickburg as the happy citizens sing the uber-infectious techno-pop ditty ""Everything is Awesome"" (a song that will be jammed in your head for the next six months). We are in the familiar world of the colorful interlock blocks so large that we get cameos by William Shakespeare, Gandalf, Superman, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Abraham Lincoln, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, C-3PO and Shaquille O'Neal. We visit a pirate world, a cowboy world, a subterranean world and many more. You know the animators have hit on a burst of genius when they employ Liam Neeson to play a character named Good Cop/Bad Cop.Our focus zeros in on a nobody, a generic construction worker named Emmett Brickowski (voiced by Chris Pratt) whose world-view is that life is a party, even at work. He's happy because every single day he gets to build something new, taking things apart and making them into something else – everything in this world is made of LEGO, so everything can be changed in an instant.One person who is not happy with the constant changes is President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell), a cold-hearted corporate ruler who wants the world to stay the way it is. He has a secret plan to nail down the blocks permanently. That's where Emmett comes in. Mistaken for ""the chosen one"", he is recruited by a counsel called The Master Builders to thwart Business' plan by building objects that will prevent his evil deeds. The problem: Emmett has no imagination; he can't build without an instruction book. The best he's come up with so far is a bunk bed couch.So, surrounded by newfound friends like the wizard Vitruvius (voiced by Morgan Freeman), a hell-cat named Wyldstyle (voiced by Elizabeth Banks) and Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) he learns to use his imagination. That's part of the spirit of this movie. It encourages free-form imagination rather than simply sticking to the prescribed instructions, which was always the spirit of the LEGO toy. Once you've build the intended toy, you break it apart and make something else. The LEGO world presented here is in that spirit. Every building, every character, and every backdrop is made out of LEGO and it is constantly changing.The script does the same. The writers have really worked on this screenplay, allowing it not simply to follow a pre-formed pattern but to move into other realms of imagination while satirizing our real-world dependence on designer coffee, computer gadgets, mechanized music and dimwitted sitcoms (Emmett really loves a one-joke show called ""Where are My Pants?"") Emmett's world is bland and homogenized and the point of the story is how he opens his mind to except an out-of-the-box form of thinking.""The LEGO movie"" is a breath of fresh air. In the past two years, animators have been satisfied to tread the safe waters of market-tested brand names and sequels. Animated films have stopped surprising us because they end up packaged as the same tired interchangeable plots that stay so grounded that they might as well have been live action. No one gets really inventive anymore. Unlike previous attempts to cash in on classic toys, like ""Battleship"", ""G.I. Joe"" and the abysmal ""Transformers"" movies, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller don't simply pay lip service to the LEGO toy, they have engineered a universe which is constantly evolving as the bricks are broken down and rebuilt into something else. They create a beautiful, colorful world of imagination and reformation that is a tribute to the endangered spirit of make-believe.**** (of four)","

I have no idea how people review this as top notch with a straight face.It's an ad they got you to pay for or, at least spend over an hour and a half to watch.I have to write at least 10 lines of text for some bizarre reason here on IMDb. Some reviews simply don't need that much.Seriously","

"julian-mumford","11 April 2014","If you search on YouTube for Death Star, Eddie Izzard and Lego, as you do. You will find a Izzard voiced skit that some smart Alec has painstakingly animated frame by frame using Lego toys. The words are funny already but combined with the visuals, this is a match made in heaven.If someone can pull this off in their bedroom, imagine what you could do with full brand licensing in your pocket, A-List acting talent, millions of studio dollars and ability to rummage in the back catalogue of popular super hero and sci-fi pop culture.Of course placing all these elements together could still foreshadow a disaster. No matter you have Morgan Freeman voicing a Gandalf style self aware wizard and a post Christopher Nolan styled Lego Batman, this is still animated Lego with a lick of CGI wizardry.Fox studios need not have worried, the film has been a massive hit not only for the younger audience but the film has that most elusive element, crossover appeal, guaranteed to generate big box office returns.Following a prelude with ""Vitruvius"" (Morgan Freeman - Voice), attempting to protect a super weapon ""Kragle"" from Lord Business (Will Ferrell - Voice), we are introduced to Emmett Joe Brickowski (Will Arnett - Voice). Emmett is an ordinary construction worker with no special skills, he gets on OK with his crew but remains largely anonymous.Following the completion of a ""most catchy tune ever"" montage, our nascent hero spots his dream girl ""Wildstyle""(Elizabeth Banks - Voice), apparently even Lego figure have desires to attend to. Literally falling for the girl, Emmett finds ""the piece of resistance"" leading to his anointment as a ""Master Builder"" and brings him to the attention of ""Good/Bad Cop"" (Liam Neeson - Voice) the trusty lieutenant of ""Lord Business"".Can Emmett save the world, is the plot an excuse to have huge amounts of self aware fun with many action set pieces and great throwaway jokes, certainly we answer affirmative to the latter.Clealy the film makers have been given carte blanche to utilise many sacred brand names, Batman, Wonder-woman, Star Wars, Green Lantern to name just a few and they make the most of the opportunity.As Batman states in in his post ironic Christian Bale style drawl ""I only build in Black and sometimes, very, very dark grey"" This works on many levels, the kids will love the action, the bright colours and the ability to re-enact the movie post credit scrawl, once parents have been bankrupted buying all the toys.To be fair, it would have been easy for the filmmakers just to make a movie length Lego promo with blatant product tie-ins but the film has been constructed with care, love, a lot of thought and attention to detail. The end is certainly not where you expect to find yourself when the film starts and again is a risk that pays huge dividends, revealing the film has a beating sentimental heart.Difficult to criticise as there is not much to dislike, the whole energy of the film is quite infectious occasionally the spell is broken and you realise you are watching animated Lego, but as someone once said, everything looks better in Lego Hugely enjoyable caper movie made entirely of Lego with clever use of words, cameos and situations, both breaking out of the confines of the genre yet satisfying those who just want a fun film for the kids to watch.Summary A no brainer must see and with a sequel already in the works, one could say without doubt that ""everything is awesome""","

"brando647","27 September 2014","When THE LEGO MOVIE first busts out the mind-melting tune of ""Everything is Awesome"" in the beginning, it's not just a means of displaying how brainwashed the Lego culture is in the movie, it's a warning of what's to come over the next 100 minutes. Because THE LEGO MOVIE is, in fact, awesome. Knowing my daughter would inevitably drag me to this movie, I was dreading its release. A kids' movie; strike one. Based on a toy property with no inherent plot; strike two. Released in the month of February, the notorious dumping ground for subpar films that would bomb any other time of year; strike three. Then the reviews started trickling out and, to my surprise, they were positive. Not just positive, but a certified fresh 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. A moviebased on basic colorful building brickswas getting better reviews than many, many others. The premise is simple (which one would expect with a movie revolving around, you know, Legos). Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt) is your average, run-of-the-mill construction worker in Bricksburg, living his life according to the proper instructions and enjoying all government-approved forms of entertainment. One night, he stumbles across the legendary ""piece of resistance""a magical artifact prophesized to identify the ""Special"" chosen one and the only thing capable of saving the world. Now a fugitive from the law, he's drawn into a world of Master-Builders with Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) where he will lead a team against the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) before he can end the world with his secret weapon: the Kra'gle.My first clue that THE LEGO MOVIE was going to be more than a corporate cash grab aimed at vulnerable children and their weak-willed minds was that it was directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. These men brought us the funniest movie of 2012 with 21 JUMP STREET and have shown they can handle themselves in comedy with a wicked sense of humor. This is one of those movies that's got plenty of goofball humor to get the kids laughing with some more subtle stuff that adults (especially those who were raised with the toys) will find fun in. Still, even the kids stuff is amusing enough that most adults (with the exception of the coldest hearts) will laugh along. There's some smart stuff here but it never sacrifices the chance for some slapstick. And the best part is the obvious love and respect for the toy itself present in every scene. Lord and Miller either major Lego fans or they're real good at faking it. This isn't a movie bent on selling toys but it'll sure make you itch for a set once it's over. It wasn't long after this came out that my daughter and I made our first visit to Legoland and I bought a few sets (as much for me as it was for her). THE LEGO MOVIE isn't here to sell a product, it's here to remind you why you loved it in the first place. And it all culminates in what is probably the only chink in the movie's armor, the climactic sequence where Emmet comes face-to-face with the ""Man Upstairs"". The message is a little heavy-handed but it's not overkill and it gets the point across.Everyone's going to walk away with a favorite character from this one. Will Arnett is a treat as Batman. He's one of the central characters as Wyldstyle's angst-ridden, arrogant boyfriend and a part of Emmet's Master-Builder team. He's essentially an 80's high school movie jock and one-third of the movie's love triangle. Liam Neeson's one of the best with his Bad Cop/Good Cop, Lord Business's main enforcer with a split personality and a penchant for roughing up chairs when he gets agitated. His action film persona where he grumbles threats and opens generous cans of whooperm, buttonly make his high-pitched, super-friend cop that much funnier. Personally, I loved Benny the ""1980's-something spaceman"". He's voiced by Charlie Day and he's just as spastic as you'd expect, and all the poor guy wants is to build a spaceship. There are Lego cameos everywhere in THE LEGO MOVIE, bringing together characters from countless properties (both original Lego and licensed). Some of the funniest bits in the movie stem from random cameos and there's one about halfway into the movie that I refuse to spoil here but, just know, it's pretty cool. And the voice cast is almost as extensive. You could miss entire chunks of the movie just trying to pinpoint the voice actors, many of which only make the briefest of appearances. One I would've missed was Nick Offerman as Metal Beard; I never would've figured that one out until I paid closer attention to the end credits.With so many easter eggs and blink-and-you-miss-them gags, I've found that THE LEGO MOVIE has some staying power. Every time I watch it, I'm finding something fun I'd missed before. As one of the few family movies that isn't downright painful for parents, this is an easy recommendation from me. With so much a movie like this had working against it from the start, THE LEGO MOVIE is definitely what I'd consider the surprise hit of 2014.","

"gamergcfan","8 February 2017","The movie was very enjoyable, well-acted, well-written, and visually beautiful. Unfortunately, I can't give this a 10 because the first 20 minutes or so drag a bit.However, the not-so-good beginning part lasts for only about 20-30 minutes or so, and it gets better later on. The second half really picks up, with lots of emotional resonance and excitement.Also, I wasn't a fan of Lego toys to begin with in the first place. I never really got into them when I played them as a 5-year-old. Nevertheless, I still managed to enjoy this movie for what it was.+ Fun+ Well-voiced+ Visually beautiful+ Good scriptDrags in the beginningScore: 9.","

"hazysistersunshine33","7 May 2014","I just saw this movie for the second time and it was still hilarious. I still laughed at all the jokes. Actually, there are so many jokes, you are laughing so much, you miss half of them. So I was able to hear a lot of jokes I did hear before. It's also one of the most colorful just neat looking movies I've ever seen. Amazing animation and everything is Lego and I mean everything from the ocean to smoke. I can imagine warehouses of Legos needed to make this movie. It just had incredibly witty clever script and I like the message is delivered. Know when to use your imagination and when to follow the rules and finding a common ground between the two. The old plane Legos vs. the new Legos with instructions. Emit is a construction worker who just wants to be accepted. He accidentally becomes ""The Special"" and is tasked to save the word. Timeless reluctant under-dog hero story like The Matrix and almost every super hero movie. See this movie and later buy the Blue Ray because I bet there will be some neat extras and I can't wait to see them.","

"shawneofthedead","8 February 2014","These days, too many movies are made with one eye on their merchandising potential. Tie-ins and merch - toys/books/Happy McMeals - are planned with as much gravity and focus as, well, the actual plot of a film. That's why The LEGO Movie should invite the greatest scepticism: it's a movie literally built out of LEGO, every kid's favourite infinitely- connectable toy bricks. It's a franchise masquerading as a film, and should be derided as such... right? Well, not quite. As it turns out, The LEGO Movie has fast become one of the best-reviewed films of the year - and for very good reason. Smart, inventive and truly hilarious, it's proof that a purely commercial enterprise can still earn genuine, heartfelt delight from audiences.Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) is a perfectly ordinary LEGO figure - the kind of dude who tries really hard to fit in (ha!) and follows the instruction manual to the letter. He has no idea, of course, that the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell) has cooked up a nefarious scheme to bring permanent order to the LEGO universe, and that Master Builders across the galaxies are banding together in wait for the foretold Special: the Master Builder who will save them all. When Emmet accidentally bumps into spunky Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), he picks up the mythical Piece Of Resistance: the fabled relic that will stop Lord Business in his tracks.Cue hijinks galore as Emmet is mistaken for the Special and swiftly swept up in an underground movement spearheaded by Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), a wise, elderly Master Builder with a (stereo)typically sonorous voice. Emmet must find a way to save the world - something he's not sure he's qualified to do, especially when he's in the company of such diverse superheroes as Batman (Will Arnett), Superman (Channing Tatum), Abraham Lincoln (Will Forte), Wonder Woman (Cobie Smulders) and... uh, sparkling, rainbow-bright Unikitty (Alison Brie).The chipper, joyful tone adopted by The LEGO Movie is what makes it such an utter delight to watch. Not only does the film trundle through one huge, action-packed set-piece after another (all gloriously executed in a combination of CGI and stop-motion animation), it's also shot through with a streak of cheerful, anarchic humour. Jokes fly thick and fast across the screen, packed so tightly together that if any one fails, there are about five more turning up in quick succession. It's hard to begrudge the film anything when its version of Batman is moody, broody, and willing to deal only in sombre-coloured bricks. This cheeky blend of irreverence and humour means that adults will find themselves every bit as entertained as the kids in the audience.It's even more remarkable when the plot unfolds to display in full its surprisingly meta-rich complexity. Turns out that the toy franchise's many LEGO lines - each with its own story and characters - gets to play a part as Emmet and Wyldstyle go hunting for an answer to the world's dilemma. Even more impressively, the world of LEGO is effectively deconstructed in the film's third act and placed firmly in the hands of anyone who's ever tried to make something out of these little toy bricks - from carefree kids to obsessed adults. It plays on precisely what makes the brand so appealing: the seemingly endless potential wrapped up in these LEGO worlds, limited only by one's imagination.The character work in the film is sublime, augmented by a wonderful cast of voice actors. Emmet - an everyman brimming with cheer and promise - suits Pratt to a T, and Banks struts her stuff as the independent, kickass Wyldstyle. Arnett is a highlight, his trademark deep voice played up to hilarious effect in Batman mode. The cast even includes sly winks to movie franchises (reuniting 21 Jump Street's Tatum with his co-star Jonah Hill, who voices Superman's super-fan, Green Lantern) and the clever-old-codger trope (Freeman is clearly having a blast as the slightly bonkers Vitruvius), while providing Liam Neeson with more acting range than he's had in a while as Lord Business' henchman, a cop with a personality split between good and bad.Not every element of The LEGO Movie works perfectly - in the tumult of surreal comedy and surprisingly emotional plot, not all the bits fit together quite as perfectly as they should. It's a mite predictable, for instance, that Emmet and Wyldstyle inevitably fall in love despite her ongoing relationship with the self-absorbed Batman. But it's impossible to get too upset about it when the final result is packed with so much silly, cheerful fun. In the words of the film's upbeat theme tune, ""Everything is AWESOME!"" And so it is - for the most part.","

"quincytheodore","19 February 2015","There hasn't been any movie, even in animation, which has the visual of The Lego Movie. Having one of a kind trait that everyone can relate to is a significant edge. It assembles the visual of CGI for stop motion feel, vigorous cast and truly entertaining script filled with pop culture references. The movie is as exciting as getting your first set of Lego.Emmet (Chris Pratt) is a Lego construction man, the run-of-the-mill ordinary one. He stumbles across a mysterious piece after his work day is over. What comes is the heroic journey where he gathers friend to overthrown the nasty antagonist. This simple premise is used with very satirical tone, and also unexpectedly deep narrative. The movie doesn't dwell too seriously on already known formula, it administers them with unusually fresh variety. It delivers an underlying message that resonates not only to children, but also all ages.Cast is simply wonderful. Everyone has their own distinguish over-the-top flair. The characters are representation of pop culture, from Batman, Morgan Freeman's prophetic Vitruvius to Liam Neeson's no nonsense Bad Cop. Glued by an amazingly witty script and lightning fast pace, the movie tirelessly delivers spot-on jokes, crazy one-liner in addition to surprisingly tender moments. The humor is sharp as well as cynical, they churn out humorous banter in nearly every conversations.Graphic is nicely done, nowadays film animations have their own different lively styles. However, The Lego Movie utilizes familiarity of its brand to the audience. It's compelling to see the minute details they put in, creative design such as the spaceship parts or the waves of ocean that imaginatively engaging, even if some looks simplistic. These features also contribute naturally on its many inside jokes.The Lego Movie embodies the spirit of the toy, it's fun, ageless and offers delightful experience.","

"JohnWelles","4 April 2014","""The Lego Movie"", directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, is a 3D animated film that exists in a world created out of Lego. This Danish company, 65 years old, is an iconic favourite and perennial feature of the children's toy market. This might be a reason for cynicism, fears of a 100 minute advertisement perhaps well founded. However, instead, it is a clever, sly subversive comedy that keeps the innate charm of the toy, while having fun at mocking business and a consumerist society of uniformity. The animation style is slightly clunky, replicating with striking fidelity the limited articulation of the original figures and the almost stop-motion quality aesthetic of the world created. The computer generated imagery is extraordinary in mirroring the plastic blocks' texture and helping make the Lego city a wonder of imagined production design.This would all be without point though, if it were not for a very witty and humorous script, written by the directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. They gleefully send-up the corporate world and the Lego brand's film tie-in ranges such as Star Wars and D.C. superheroes. They're ably abetted by a talented vocal cast, featuring Chris Pratt, Will Ferrel, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson and a whole host of guest voices, from Jonah Hill to Billy Dee Williams. The jokes range from popular culture to very specific references to past Lego ranges, slapstick to in-jokes, satire to one-liners, in a melange designed to appeal to all ages. Lord and Miller know well that the finest children's movies are ones that attract adults as well, and here they achieve their goal with aplomb.Still, the film never quite avoids a sentimental, good-intentioned moral which so many films of this genre are saddled with. Its plot twist, influenced by ""The Matrix"" (1999), whilst initially surprising and amusing does eventually lose some of its ingenuity. Some of the action scenes go on far too long, excessive demonstrations of versatility that are never as fun as just the pure moments of comedy. The script eventually has to resolve the conflicts it sets up, leading to a slightly weaker second half overall.Yet this is never enough to sour ""The Lego Movie"", which, on the contrary, is mainly a delight, always funny and far cleverer than any movie based on a children's toy has any right to be.","

"brchthethird","14 November 2014","THE LEGO MOVIE is a very entertaining, funny and, in the end, rather poignant film that will appeal to kids and adults. The story is about a nondescript, fit-in-with-the-crowd nobody named Emmett who accidentally happens upon a mythical ""Piece of Resistance."" Aided by the Master Builders, he tries to stop the universe from being ruined by Lord/President Business. Having only just watched this now, as it makes its way onto home video, I didn't watch it in theaters although I was aware of the hype and positive reactions to it, both from critics and audiences. However, I must say that I wasn't too impressed with it. The story is rather ho-hum and bland, not unlike the main character is for most of the movie. What kept me invested was all of the in-jokes and pop culture references. Nothing was laugh-out-loud funny, but it did make me chuckle consistently. The best bits were probably from Batman, Superman and Green Lantern (voiced by Will Arnett, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, respectively). Another strong point was the large ensemble voice cast, which included Chris Pratt (Emmett), Will Ferrell (Lord Business), Elizabeth Banks (Wild Side) and Morgan Freeman (Vitruvius/The Wizard?). Despite the rather bland story, things were practically saved near the end when it takes a rather poignant turn which I won't spoil (for the few people who haven't seen it yet). The end makes everything that came before it worth watching. Still, I can't quite bring myself to forgive everything else completely. Among those things is a ridiculously catchy earworm that gets repeated ad nauseam. In the end, it is something that both kids and adults can get enjoyment out of, even if it's more fluff than substance","

"michael_the_nermal","7 April 2014","From a visual perspective, ""The Lego Movie"" is spectacular. The computer animation seems flawless, and the depiction of the Lego World was amazing. This film's second positive attribute is its clever writing and humor. I loved that the Lego people placed supernatural power on everyday household items that wandered into their world. This film could have been absolutely terrible. It, like ""The Transformers"" of the '80s, or its predecessor ""Gobots: Battle for the Rock Lords,"" could have been panned by anyone over 13 as just a cash-in to sell more Legos. This film does have adult sensibilities, and the screenwriters envisioned a movie that had an actual message worth saying. For cynical parents, this movie is *not* merely a cash-in that will have your children screaming tantrums for an Emmett and Lord Business Playset; this movie has fully-fleshed-out and funny characters. Chances are you, the grownups, will be laughing and even empathizing with Emmett and his other plastic friends.Now on to this film's themes, which may leave some parents puzzled. On the surface, this movie is about the conflict between creativity and strict obedience to sets of rules, mostly in the realm of art (I suppose you could say this conflict applies to all aspects of life, but ""art"" is the subject that came to mind first). Strangely, I think this film is morally ambitious as to its message, though that does not seem the case at allat least, not at first. The villain is, for lack of a better word, an ""aesthete"": he has a vision of perfection and beauty for the world that others may see as too strict and rigid; he literally wants to glue his subjects in place so that everything in the Lego World will be ""perfect"" as he sees itor ""awesome"", as the film's main song suggests. He is opposed by a group of subjects who refuse to ascribe to his vision of ""perfection"" and instead emphasize free thought and wild creativity over *any* order. On the surface, the film may be a parable about the struggle between democracy over fascism, but I don't quite see the film's message as being on that large of a scale. The message is about how best to create works of art; and, odd as it seems, I can see Legos as a medium through which artistic expression can come alive. This film has two extremes: there's the fascistic world of LegoTown, where everything is to be done according to specific sets of written rules; and there's the colorful, psychedelic Cloud Cuckoo Land, where there is no order at all: cynics would say the Cloud Cuckoo Landers live a life of anarchy and chaos, and it would be a wonder that things get done at all. The rebel Legos' devotion to extreme creativity has its limits, and this is shown in the film. It's up to Emmett, the protagonist, to find a compromise between extreme order and specificity and extreme creativity. He is, indeed ""The Special""; the bridge that leads to a path of moderation between two extreme views of expression.This film gives the grownup viewer a lot to wrap his or her mind around. The ambiguous tone will also confound those who think they have this movie's message pegged down. It's not just a kid's movie: it's a clever manifesto about the nature of the creative process! And it offers no easy answers! This message is wrapped around clever humor, silly characters, and excellent animation. By all means, take your kids to watch this film; but don't offer them easy answers about the film's moral, either.","

"jhigginbotham151","3 May 2014","The Lego Movie is so much fun. Anyone who grew up building things out of legos, you will love this. The film is exactly what its like when you play with legos as a kid, you put the batman in with the construction set and star wars into Gotham City, you went crazy and put everything into your own little world of awesome. Then of course, there's the kid who always tried to have everything in order, everything in its place and have everything be... not awesome.The Lego Movie captures all of the same feelings from your childhood and bundles in up in to a very enjoyable, easily digested 100 minutes. Emmet is the main character and hero of the story, he's a very relatable character in the sense that he's upbeat about everything, even though his life is stale and he blends in with everyone else. This makes him a good role model for kids (always be yourself and always try and stand out from the crowd) and makes him an interesting character to root for. Lucy is the hipster-like love interest for Emmet and she brings some girl power into the film that gives the girls someone to relate to as well. Batman and the other characters are all there to give the story its grand scope and also to provide some of the funniest moments in the whole film. Its also nice to see that it doesn't feel that only characters the filmmakers could get the rights too are included, it really does feel like any lego character you could think of is there in the film.The film also has some astonishingly clever social commentary and pop culture references for what is primarily a kids film. The films main theme song 'Everything Is Awesome' is a parody of today's modern pop radio and is considered by Lucy to be a song only people who blend in listen to. However, Lucy then goes on to say that Batmans emo,screamo- like song is what 'real music' is. Its a loving little nudge at what we as a society deem as popular and unpopular, what's real entertainment and what isn't. References practically seem to write themselves here, given the amount of characters they included, although my favorite has to be Green Lantern being a massive fanboy of Superman. The animation looks so close to the same stop motion animation you would see on YouTube, giving it a very real, homemade feeling, but of course with a much bigger budget and it does look very nice. Water, fire and everything else are rendered in its lego format and props to the animators because everything on screen is CG. Then there's one scene which I was so happy to see include, I wont spoil it but it's the scene that summed up the entire film for me.Overall, The Lego Movie is a superb film for all ages. Its bright, funny and inspiring for the kids and has enough under the hood to make it enjoyable for adults as well.","

"tiffanyyongwt","23 February 2014","The LEGO® Movie got to be the most ""awesome"" movie in the most ""awkward"" way. Is it an awesome movie? Erm, I got to admit, I was kind of dozing on and off for the first 80 minutes, which rarely happened to me (like once out of hundred films and this is that one time?) So instead of raving about why you should watch this film like every single Lego fan out there, perhaps it will be more suitable for me to tell you WHO will actually enjoy or even understand the film.The Must-Go-Watchers: Lego Fans (obviously), star wars or DC Comic fans. If you don't watch Star Wars, you might end up with several moments where you are wondering why are people laughing (yes, that happened to me -.-. Many classic lines, including lines from Liam Neeson's Taken, were used which made the film interesting. Fans who had grown up playing Lego will find the film nostalgic, as they go into details like change hair, the body (outfit) and even what they can hold with their claim like hands. What's more? They have a great catchy song, which goes on in your mind like the minion song.Read more: http://tiffanyyong.com/2014/02/05/the-lego-movie-review/","

"bm2759","26 February 2014","Thus far this is tied with Her as my favourites for 2014. There is a lot to like about this movie especially having seen it in 3D which enhances just how entertaining this is. A obvious comment - this is Lego brought to life! I loved how well thought through this movie was. Whilst it references popular culture both through characters of other stories but also Internet memes such as Batman's capacity to achieve anything. It has aptly timed humour that was refreshingly unexpected. But most of all I really enjoyed how to the story unfolded with the presence of real world items; the end result being an acknowledgement of the creativity found in a child's mind and how adults can inhibit this. Brilliant.On that note I really appreciated the deeper meaning in this film and how well rounded the message is: creativity shouldn't be limited to those who think freely and originally. Anyone is capable of creativity whether it be complete new, a slight different, or a revised of something already present. But beyond that independent creativity thought should be applauded communal creative thought should be too. As well as creative thought derived from instructions.Toy Story 3 was the last animation film I saw which was explored childhood and what it meanings, including growing up. It was a masterpiece which hasn't been topped. Lego Movie is not as good and is different but what it does share is an equally relevant showcase of experiences children have.I trust you, like me, walked away from this movie wanting to play with Lego, play Mindcraft or do something creative. Wonderful!","

Even when the pace is awesome for the most part, the slow parts where they develop the characters and story still felt a bit too boring. Understandable because the targets are the little kids, but for some reason the last act gets so predictable in every sense and sooooo family friendly or more kid friendly that my real enjoyment ends basically 30' before the credits (with some fun stuff in between of course, including the action), which is too much time to give it a bigger score, considering plenty of other movies for kids have me from the start with no problem.","

"Bob-45","23 June 2015","Until the last 20 minutes of ""The Lego Movie,"" I was about to call it, ""the best animated feature ever"". Full of the madcap ""Looney Tunes"" humor and sly references to the New World Order and libertarian advocacy, I had, to that point, loved every minute. THEN, Will Ferrell shows up and spoils everything. Actually, the unfortunate choice to ""wire the ghost"" was the first slip-up. However, the live action scenes with Will Ferrell just laid there. Most of the problems in these scenes are likely the fault of the director or editor. In any event, they completely destroy the pacing of the movie. Darn; and I was hoping to say I liked ""The Lego Movie"" better than ""Big Hero 6; which, ironically, reaches its level of brilliance at nearly the same point as ""The Lego Movie"" falls apart. Oh well, NEARLY ""everything is awesome"".I give ""The Lego Movie"" an ""8"".","

"wetmars","28 August 2021","Huh, this movie was deeper than I last watched it. The first LEGO Movie to be made unless you count The Adventures of Clutch Power which is incredibly based. The film was widely entertaining, action-packed, comedic, suspenseful, well-written with an interesting storyline, great characters. Speaking about them. Bad Cop & Lord Business' redemption is how you do a redemption other than Kylo Ren / Ben Solo's redemption. You can arguably say that Emmet was the best character where he was an average, normal, kind of guy, barely remembered, saying yes to everything, blank-state, to realizing in the devastation that he's just nothing. Then he realizes that he's something more, and he has to believe. A Master Builder where he can build anything out of bricks without using any instructions in the Third Act. You can see that the Master Builders are the friends of the Jedi, haha.Lord Business is an excellent villain where he had enough of ""a bunch of weird dorky stuff that ruined"" his ""perfectly good stuff"". I do like how there's a deeper meaning to this where it isn't all about children's entertainment, but where it's between a father and son. It's beautifully well-done, and the performance was perfect. ""So, President Business is the bad guy...?"" I feel so emotional about the ""being special / nothing"" parts. A bunch of people is told that they're nothing. I appreciate the message about the message. ""You...don't have to be the bad guy. You are the most talented, most interesting, and extraordinary person in the universe. And you are capable of amazing things because you are the Special.""Lucy is a well-explored character, I must say? She has a complex personality where she can be sometimes rude, but she has a lighter side. Eventually, this would be explored more in the Second Film. Vitruvius is my man where he is wise, genuinely likable. His death was dark for a ""kids movie"", but hilarious at the same time. Batman is Batman.10/10.","

"Quietb-1","19 February 2014","Here's a movie based on a toy plastic building brick. Of course the early trailers looked lame and what are they thinking? Now the movie arrives and dominates the box office, because it is good. Not too intense for kids and enough jokes for adults. There is a break neck pace, and a color assault on the senses. There's a catchy song and well voiced characters. There is even a fun twist that gives a sense of reality to the whole deal. Here's a movie for the entire family. The 3D works and is worth the up charge. See it. Based on the box office success expect more Lego movies in the future.","

"MihaiSorinToma","8 September 2017","In a world where everything is made out of Lego, an ordinary guy, almost invisible to everyone, discovers a piece that can fulfill an ancient prophecy and save the universe from the evil claws of President Business. He joins a team of Master Builders and together they must plan their moves of stopping the imminent evil.It's a movie based on the Lego universe which brings together with all their constructions and contraptions a lot of famous characters like Batman, Superman and others. Although it is based on a cliché story of an ordinary guy that must save the world, it is mostly interesting and entertaining but you cannot miss the parody-like atmosphere and it's superficiality in several acts. Those wouldn't have been such a big problem if it wasn't for its finale which is too childish and disappointing. I had some great expectations regarding this one so I'm a bit disappointed, but that doesn't mean that it is a bad movie. It's just that I hoped that it would a wonderful animation movie with Lego which frankly isn't.","

"hprashantarora","17 February 2014","Boy, what a letdown. I am a big fan of LEGO's; played with them throughout my childhood and my daughters have tons of them, so naturally I was very excited to see it with the family. A rating of 8.6 on IMDb (now 8.5) was encouraging but it turned out to be a big bore. Don't get me wrong dear fans. The movie must have looked great on paper, in story boards and during CGI processing. Clearly, lot of effort went into the making of this movie and the artists should be thanked for that butthere's always a ""but."" And in this case there are lot's of buts. First of all the running time is way too long. Two hours for an animated film that goes at a break neck speed? Give me a break. No, really I needed a break while viewing it. This film is chock full of imagery that is radiant with every possible color, hue, tint, and shape that morph into other shapes in the blink of an eye. So you never really know what's going on at any given time. And I am saying this from a kid's perspective. 30 minutes into the movie and my daughter wanted to go home.Clearly, this movie was not made for kids but for adults like me who grew up playing with LEGO but I hated it. Every single scene has a dozen characters in it and they are all loud. You don't need that to happen in nearly every scene. The jokes are average too. It seems as if the film makers just couldn't decide which joke to throw out and decided to keep everything just in case. They should have consulted guys from Pixar on the proper use of restraint and effective deliverance of a message. I know this film will do well with the ADHD crowd (no offense to the real patients) that thrives on YouTube videos. I came out of the theater with a mild headache and in my misery asked my kids what they leaned from the movie. First they gave me a blank stare and then all of a sudden started shouting the title song while flailing their arms,"" Everything is awessssssome."" Yeah, right!","

Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt) just wants to fit in with all of his neighbors and coworkers. He believes the best way to do that is by following the strict instructions given to him by the President of the Lego society, Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Little does Emmet know that Lord Business is actually planning to destroy the whole world using a powerful tool called CraGle, Crazy Glue. A prophecy made by an old man Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) predicts that a master builder will find a powerful piece that can stop the destruction.With the help of his henchman Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) who has personality disorders and sometimes is good, Lord Business captures Emmet who wakes up to find that the powerful piece is stuck to his back. Emmet manages to escape when he is saved by Wild Style (Elizabeth Banks) and brought to Vitruvius to discover his destiny. They go on a crazy adventure meeting all sorts of popular characters including Wild Style's super serious boyfriend Batman (Will Arnett), Unikitty (Alison Brie), Astronaut Benny (Charlie Day), and Metal Beard (Nick Offerman).Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com","

"bryank-04844","22 August 2015","In the past, we've seen video games and board games adapted into movies for the big screen. More often than not, these adaptations are usually panned by critics everywhere and let down the fans. Or the film is decent enough for a 'one-time' watch, then is completely forgotten. You can say the above about 'Battleship', 'Street Fighter', or 'House of the Dead'. 'Clue' might be the only board game adaptation to sustain any sort of fan following, and actually has received a lot of positive remarks since it came out 1985.But nowadays, where kids born in the 70s and 80s, are having their favorite toys and games adapted into main-stream movies. LEGOS have been around for a very long time. I remember playing with them for years on end, building dinosaurs, cities, and spaceships. It seems that for several years, LEGO went off the radar, but over the past few years, they have made a comeback in an epic way. Now, there are LEGO boutique shops at almost every mall across America, not to mention a LEGO theme park called LEGOLAND. And we have been seeing more and more movies and TV shows selling their rights to LEGO, in order to sell LEGO-themed products. We've seen 'Star Wars', 'Lord of the Rings', and 'The Simpsons', to name a few, all now part of the LEGO world.It was only a matter of time before there was big LEGO movie with A-List stars attached to be released. Well that time has finally come, and I'm here to say that it is everything I could have hoped for and more. Just like the song you hear in the amazing trailer, ""Everything is Awesome"", that is how you can describe the 'LEGO MOVIE'. It's rare when I have high hopes for a film, and then the film delivers on every level. I'm just glad it happened with this particular movie, as I'm sure fans of all ages will thoroughly enjoy this beautifully animated film.Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the two guys who gave us 'Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs', the remake of '21 Jump Street', and the hilarious TV series 'Clone High', did a knock out job with the 'LEGO Movie'. The conjured up one hell of a cast that delivers on every note, along with some beautiful animation that brightens up the screen everywhere, and have given us a script that will not only make kids under the age of 10 laugh, but will also get the adults to burst out with laughter as well.The film just works on every level. The story focuses on Emmet (Chris Pratt), who seems to be the happiest guy in the city. He loves his job as a construction worker and enjoys following the rule book. However, Emmet seems to normal and nobody really pays attention to him. Meanwhile, there is an evil man trying to take over all of LEGO world who calls himself Lord Business and doubles as President Business (Will Ferrell), the nicer face to the people, as to trick them into his villainous scheme. Vituvius who resembles a 'God' like figure (Morgan Freeman, of course), tells of a prophecy of a special guy who will one day realize his abilities and save the world from Lord Business. Well, this happens to be Emmet, as he pairs up a hip chick named Wyldestyle (Elizabeth Banks), to set out on an adventure to recruit a bunch of other people to destroy Lord Business.They enlist the help of Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, the Star Wars characters, a unicorn-kitty, and just about every other pop culture icon you think of. The results are hilarious, as each actor lending their voice does a perfect job. Will Arnett as Batman is genius casting and the Star Wars cameos made me excited once again for a 'Star Wars' movie. The different worlds in the LEGO world all bring back tons of nostalgic memories of growing up, and are all laid out perfectly here.The pacing is quick, and there is never a dull moment. I couldn't stop singing the 'Everything is Awesome' song for two days after I saw the movie, and my only thought was that I had to see this movie again. I can easily say that 'LEGO MOVIE' is one of the best films of the year so far. Sure, it's only the first week of February, but it really is that good. Rush out to see this film. You'll love it.","

"jdkraus","30 July 2014","K-NEX and Legos. Those were the building toys I grew up on. They were awesome. A Lego Movie did not sound awesome. It actually seemed ridiculous and just overall bad. It took a bit of persuasion from a friend to see this movie. Only 10 minutes into watching it, my verdict was immediate awesomeness. The story itself is really not that great. It's orbital protagonist is Emmet (Chris Pratt), an ordinary guy who is considered to be ""the chosen,"" who will obtain a mystical item called the ""resistance piece"" and vanquish Lord Business (Will Ferrel), who has enslaved just about all the people in Lego World into a strict, scheduled, totalitarian government. He is aided by some other fellow lego characters and is mercilessly pursued by Bad Cop (Liam Neeson). This all sounds like a clichéd plot.But, what makes ""The Lego Movie"" awesome is all its other recipes. The animation, combined with both CG and stop motion, is flawless and glorious to watch. I recommend viewing it on a big TV screen (I did not see it in theater, so I can only imagine its fun magnitude). The colors and animation are beautiful. The voice acting cast is perfect. Additional names include Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, Morgan Freeman, and Charlie Day. Arnett and Neeson steal the show as Batman and Good Cop Bad Cop. I never would have taken Neeson for comedy. He does two interchanging voices so well that I can't take him seriously, as intended for the movie of course. Perhaps the best part is the overall fun that the movie delivers. It gives a nostalgic look back on childhood and parodies so many other games, movies, characters, and toys to the point that I was laughing non-stop. Batman, Superman, The Green Lantern, Abe Lincoln, Han Solo, Chewbecca, Gandalf, Dumbledore, and Unikitty all make hysterical appearances. I can't think of any rating other than a perfect score to give this movie. It's not the best movie ever made, but just like the song in the beginning of the movie, ""Everything is awesome.""","

"nicholls905-280-546911","26 January 2020","Right out of the gates, you know this animated film is self aware. The Lego designs are exactly like some from my childhood, and the characters interact with the world just like we would. On paper this might've sounded like another tiresome toy manufacturers attempt to target another medium, but that's definitely not the case. The filmmakers are the key here and they continue a successful streak of comedy films. Their humour is very sharp and they push this self aware nature through the storyline. Strong cast and vast supply of cameo voices throughout. Interesting film and deserved a sequel.","

"Darkside-Reviewer","20 April 2021","I've never really had any interest in these kinds of movies mainly due to the fact that they are made more for children than they are for adults. However I recently watched the Lego Batman Movie (2017) and I actually somewhat enjoyed it. The reason for that is probably because I have been reading the Batman comics since I was ten years old so I'm more inclined to enjoy something I can relate to in some way. I thought maybe I should give some of the other Lego movies a try and since the Lego Movie features a wide range of characters from different universe's like LOTR and Batman I thought it would at least be worth a watch.I honestly didn't enjoy this movie nearly as much as I did Lego Batman but I kind of expected that would be the case since this movie is a lot more child/family friendly. The animation is amazing with beautiful vivid colours and stunning backgrounds. The problem however for me at least is the movie is just far too for lack of a better word ""Hyperactive"" and fast paced. This is now a common theme in most modern day children's movies. Instead of telling a unique story with likable and engaging characters that children can enjoy and learn from, the makers of the Lego movie just decided that all kids want to see is colourful characters jumping around for an hour and a half. Every ten minutes there's an action scene that seems to go a mile a minute like the movie itself has ADD and can't slow down in case children watching the movie get bored from a lack of movement.The Lego Movie is a perfectly harmless kids movie that most children will find enjoyable and entertaining, the story is all about everyone being special and unique in their own way so the movies message is a positive one. There are a handful of genuinely funny moments that adults will chuckle at but for the most part it's just a harmless kids movie based on the Lego toys.","

"ersinkdotcom","23 June 2014","What can be said about ""The Lego Movie"" that already hasn't? I think the millions upon millions of children singing the songs from the blockbuster sum everything up quite well. Warner Bros. Pictures and the Lego brand have most definitely hit pay dirt with a film that attracts not only rough and tumble boys looking to build something to knock it down, but even gentle little girls who dream of princesses and Uni- Kitties. The evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) plots to glue the Lego Universe together in permanent harmony. A construction worker named Emmet (Chris Pratt) is believed to be the ""Special"" who will deliver the Lego world from the grasps of the tyrant. He teams up with feisty female Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks), Batman (Will Arnett), Superman (Channing Tatum), and other reluctant heroes to stop the oppressor and his minions.The film is rated PG for mild action and rude humor. Although some might say there's some violence, it's always meant to be lighthearted and never taken seriously. After all, they ARE only Legos. The only people who will have a problem with this movie are ones who don't like the violent silliness of ""The Three Stooges.""""The Lego Movie"" is a rousing good time for the whole family. It's front-loaded with enough juvenile humor to satisfy any child and packed with a sufficient amount of pop culture references to attract older audiences and members of the geek illuminati. The only thing you have to worry about is the annoyance you'll begin to experience from having your kids run around the house singing ""Everything is Awesome"" day and night.","

"ammarjamal","6 February 2014","We all love legos, who doesn't?! In the lego movie, we see the best of legos, we see lego as we've never seen it before...it's the closest thing to being a lego.Personally I hate animation but I gave this movie a chance as it has all my favourite characters (batman, superman, Gandalf and even Dumbledore) at first the movie seemed boring and full of clichés and it felt awkward watching 1.5 hours of stop motion, but as the movie progresses it seems to grow to the viewer, it got my full concentration after the first 20 minutes, and the movie became great. The directing in the lego movie was amazing I loved it, it made the movie seem like a big budget epic, and really helped me in understating the story. The lego movie's story was very average and very generic at first, all that ""believe in your self"" cliché but as the movie progresses the story really stands out, even though the message is very common amongst animation movies, the lego movie seems to pull it off, adding excellent elements and a lot of humour...I mean A LOOOT! The voice actors are of coarse amazing, Chris Prat was perfect as Emit, and Elizabeth Banks was great at WyldStyle, and Will Ferrel was brilliant as always, one thing I did not like was Will Arnett's batman voice, it just wasn't batman.Overall The Lego Movie is a great film, it was OK at first but it gets much better towards the end.","

"sesht","9 February 2014","My review, with information that could be considered spoiler-ific. Be prepared to enjoy an intelligent, memorable movie, that takes the theme of creation using Lego blocks, and crafting a story around it that is not just entertaining, but also a delight and a treat for the senses. However, it does not seem to be deserving of all the excessive praise being heaped on it, esp. since the kids might not be taking away as much as us adults. Up, Finding Nemo and Incredibles happen to be those works that transcend age - and though this one's a lotta fun, its not in their league, not the way most critics are making it out to be. The voice talent is quite varied, and eclectic even, with most of the laughs coming from the character voiced by the ever-elegant Morgan Freeman, who gamely pokes a lot of fun at his own persona; as does Liam Neeson. They're efficiently surrounded by Ferrell, Banks, Pratt, Brie, Arnett, Hill, Day and the like, and the sincerity shows in every phrase/frame. It is most difficult to wrong surprises while sticking close to the formula, and both Lord/Miller show that their rendering of 21 Jump Street was no flash in the pan (I'm in the minority of not being a big fan of 'Cloudy with...', since spite of having watched it on IMAX 3D). What's dividing critics, and put me solidly on the other side of the fence, is the whole meta-aspect to the whole thing, that, IMO, was introduced unnecessarily in the 3rd act, though the final denouement (which was strong) would make no sense without that. If that had been handled better, I'd be rooting for this one all the way, the way most of the masses are doing right now. However, conclusively, this is quite a lot of good fun at the movies, so I'd advise for all families to make that trip to the local multiplex and have a nice time.","

"griffolyon12","9 February 2014","Everything is awesome in the new film, The Lego Movie. The film is exactly as it sounds, it's a film about Legos, set in a world made entirely of Legos. It's quite simple in all honesty, but it's in the satire and the surprising depth that this film has that makes it awesome.The Lego Movie follows Lego construction worker, Emmett, who is as normal as anyone can be. Emmett always follows the instructions, until one night he comes across this thing known as the relic, and the relic is the only thing that can stop the evil Lord Business from using Krazy Glue and gluing all of the Lego pieces of the world together.The film is a very witty satire in the way that it pokes fun at just about every movie convention you've seen in major Hollywood blockbusters over the past 10-20 years. There are pointless prophecies, chosen ones, evil world-ending machines, even a character who is Good Cop and Bad Cop. When Good Cop-Bad Cop spins his head, the back of his head has a different face, and depending on which side he is showing, he is either good or he is bad. There is a lot of ingenious humor in the film, even if every joke doesn't always land because there are just so many packed in there. However, what really impressed me with this film was the thematic depth it has.Anyone going to see The Lego Movie is expecting a comedy, and the film is that, even in its more serious moments, but there is a very clever twist in the final third of the film that really makes this a unique, one-of-a-kind animated film. It is this twist that really gives the film weight. While the traditional idea of being an individual and not always following the traditional flow seems to be the big idea that the filmmakers are wanting you to believe in at first, once this twist occurs, you realize that the film is saying something even deeper than that. I'll say no more, other than the fact that Will Ferrell, who voices Lord Business, really shines in the final act of the film, shedding his man-child persona to adopt one of seriousness.Overall, The Lego Movie is about as good of a time as you can have with any movie out there. It's like a weird blend of Pixar meets Monty Python and Mel Brooks. The CG animation replicates the look of those stop motion Lego cartoons you can find on YouTube, but better. I am not gonna lie and say my jaw didn't drop a few times at the technical perfection on display here, but it's the humor and the heart that really makes The Lego Movie an awesome experience. Even when the film has a slight case of ADD, you are still charmed.I give The Lego Movie a 9 out of 10!","

"nnguyen0297","22 February 2014","I can't believe how impressive this movie was. When I first saw it, it just blew my mind away. Every about it was lovable. The story, the animation, the cast, the characters, the humor, it was a thrill ride. It's definitely a good film to kick of 2014, and is one that you definitely don't want to miss. You could tell that they went all out on this. It's one thing to make stop motion in general, but doing with Lego and making it that good is just impressive. And let's not forget the strong cast which includes Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Will Ferrel, Elizabeth Banks, Will Arnett, and numerous cameos including Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Shaq among many others. But probably the best thing about the movie was it's sense of humor. Though the first 10 minutes was quite boring and seemed like a typical animated film, the film spiraled high after wards and will keep you laughing all the way through. All of the cast members like Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman who you would never expect to do something comedic gave it there all here, and that only made it 10x funnier. But if there's' some thing I didn't like about the movie, it would have to be the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but there's this little twist in the end that was quite un-expecting, but a bit unnecessary. With all honesty though, the ending wasn't that bad, and some of you may even like it. Overall, The Lego Movie"" is a great movie that' sun for all ages.","

"Imdbidia","5 January 2017","The Lego movie has an imaginative original story, great characters, dialogues and message. The story mixes a bit of surrealism, absurdity and child-like stories and mixes it with a bit of super-hero stuff and a bit of social critique. The dialogues are funny and witty. The narrative is perhaps my favorite part of the film.The animation is excellent, however this is not the sort of visuals I enjoy. I say this because the film is visually overwhelming, too much happening on every scene, too many figurines in each scene, too much is too much. Besides, the movie has no tempo or pace, or the pace is just run run run -- Lego on steroids. So I watched this movie with some sort of visual anxiety if that can be said. Unfortunately, it is not just a bit here and there, it is from beginning to end, so I felt it was an exhausting watching despite me liking the story overall.The same story, the same Lego pieces, with a bit of more air and a different pace would have produced a rounder more enjoyable film, at least to me.The Lego Movie tries to remind us all of how important is to play with toys, to develop our imagination, and how being silly is actually quite smart at times. Playing with toys has no rules, no limits, it can be as silly or senseless as you want, as long as you are having fun, all is possible.","

A movie about legos is a great idea, but much of the film is rather awkward and confusing. It's hard to keep track of what's what. For a little while I was actually having a hard time staying awake. What makes it especially weird is how it eventually starts transitioning from the fantasy animated world to the real world. I can see why some people may like this, but I find it to be basically just a weird interruption. If the movie had started out in the real world before going into the main story, it would've made a little more sense.","

"ed-421","8 February 2014","In The Birds by Aristophanes (414BC), Mr. Trusting and Mr. Hopeful erect a perfect city in the clouds, to be named Cloud Cuckoo Land -- an unrealistically idealistic state where everything is perfect. The Birds (414BC) is described by critics as a ""perfectly realized fantasy remarkable for the gaiety of its songs"".Scratch the surface, and there is darkness underneath. This is also an underlying theme of The Lego Movie. In the opening, main character Emmitt sees a TV show where the president lets on that the world will end in three days. And then everyone goes back to being happy, as the costs of everything go up, and all the jokes and songs are repeated. Everyone follows instructions.Later, Emmitt is interrogated by ""Bad Cop"" -- and occasionally reassured by ""Good Cop"". While the Good Cop makes everything seem okay and perfect, the Bad Cop is never far away.Later, they go to Cloud Cuckoo Land (!), ""a land up in the clouds where there are no rules, no limits, no bushy mustaches and no bedtimes."" There they meet Princess Unikitty, who has no negative thoughts. Wyldstyle remarks on how often she says ""No"" in the place with no rules.Later still, there is a wonderful place, but with signs saying ""Do Not Touch"" and ""Off Limits"" everywhere.--- and I'll stop Lego Movie = Greek Comedy there ---This is one of those movies with a lot of layers. I wondered how I would describe the movie. Action Thriller? Superhero? Love Story? Horror? Comedy? Tragedy? Sci-Fi? Fantasy? Western? Cataclysm? I thought about how I could argue the case for any of these. I greatly enjoyed the zippy, intense, manic drive of the movie, and liked many of the jokes -- but also frequently saw the underlying darkness that was being hinted at. Well, perhaps not hinted -- many of the references were blatant, but maybe they expect that most people will be distracted by the action and not try to process something important, just like Emmitt at the start of the movie.Fun and exciting, but underneath, it's like Batman, where everything is dark.","

"DareDevilKid","12 June 2014","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4/5 starsAs a rule, movies about toys need to be approached with extreme caution; some of them have been bad enough to count as health hazards. This one is the exception. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who made ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"", have delivered another essay in controlled madness, bombarding you with far more candy-colored detail than you can process—though, by some miracle, not too much to stomach. In short, pop culture eats itself. Everything you see, until the closing scenes, is Lego: people, landscapes, and products. Even fiery bolts of laser beam are orange plastic rods. You could try to resist or lament this marketing frenzy, but the movie is way, way ahead of you, landing joke after joke about the shiny pretensions of the Lego world.The story follows Emmet (Chris Pratt) an ordinary, rules- following, perfectly average Lego miniature figure who is mistakenly identified as the most extraordinary person and the key to saving the world. He is drafted into a fellowship of strangers on an epic quest to stop an evil tyrant, a journey for which Emmet is hopelessly and hilariously under-prepared. A construction worker by profession, Emmett is blissfully ignorant and content - like most of the Lego world - with the corporate and authoritative powers that monitor and dictate every aspect of his life and who have convinced him that this is his idyllic lifestyle. One day he stumbles on a magic brick that will reveal some higher truth, though the film takes ruthless comic pains to knock down the pomposity, derivation, and heavy-handedness that usually plagues such fantastical narratives.Without question, the film will unabashedly entertain you from start to finish. Kids all over will love it, but like all really smart animated films, it promises a great time as well for the adults. Along with delving into deep nostalgia territory and bringing back the world of Lego building blocks in all their glory, adults will also instantly recognize the wickedly funny and well-aimed sassy darts shot at corporate branding. If you care to scratch the surface a bit, ""The Lego Movie"" also reveals copious amounts of metaphors - coated in hilariously humorous moments and dialogues - which take potshots at how corporate bigwigs are all but controlling every aspect of our monotonous existence and how we wittingly succumb to the manipulation of these powers when all we need to do is remain steadfast and resolve to live our lives on our own terms. The movie's irresistible theme song, ""Everything is Awesome"", is a delightful dig and corporate branding, capitalist manipulation, and draconian bureaucracy, which in all likelihood will go down as one of the greatest cinematic metaphors of all time. Satirical subversion in family entertainment is an unexpected treat, especially in a movie that also functions as a triumph of product placement.The movie is designed with so much energy it sometimes spins out of control. But the fun is nonstop. The visuals are spectacular, the 3D technology is artfully used and the story is jam-packed with so many funny lines, it's hard to catch all the jokes that are delivered in rapid-fire succession — constantly tweaking many popular culture icons. Major credit for this sublime achievement goes to Directors and co- writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the dynamic duo who earlier brought us ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" — another terrific animated romp. As mentioned earlier, ""The Lego Movie"" is a visual spectacle and the most amazing thing is how everything looks as though it's constructed out of Legos. That goes for raging fire and even the wild waves of a turbulent sea rolling under a pirate ship under full sail. The enormous team of animators and designers who first built this make-believe world out of more than 15 million Legos, before translating it all into a gorgeous, computer-generated adventure also merit the same amount of lavish praise in successfully assembling this instantaneous animated classic. If there's one minor contention with the film, it would probably boil down to it being a bit too fast-paced at times. Slowing down the tempo in certain scenes (a la Hayao Miyazaki) would have elevated it several notches higher; plausibly even give it a perfect 5 rating.Top-notch voice talent is key to any successful animated film, and ""The Lego Movie"" does not disappoint. Chris Pratt is perfectly enthusiastic and naive as the reluctant hero Emmet; Elizabeth Banks throws out edgy wit voicing the action heroine Wyldstyle; Will Arnett is great as the growling, self-obsessed Batman, and Will Ferrell is on target as President Business, the order-obsessed leader of this world of Lego. On top of all that, add in the characteristic dulcet pitch of Morgan Freeman as the aged sage, Vitruvius, and and the sonorous tone of Liam Neeson as the president's hilarious Bad Cop/Good Cop sidekick, and you've got quite the crew of great acting voices.""The Lego Movie"" is a terrific, fun-packed, well-crafted, thoughtful, and outstanding piece of animated cinematic magic. Just like its theme song goes, this film is truly ""awesome"".","

"TheSquiss","5 March 2014","I had little interest in seeing The Lego Movie until I heard Mark Kermode's verdict in his blog about Liam Neeson. Even then it wasn't enough to make me buy a ticket. It took Roocayke, the nephew who last month subjected me to Walking With Dinosaurs 3D, to force me into it. Would this be two strikes against him or could he earn a redemption?Emmet (Chris Pratt) is a bog standard, Lego mini-figure construction worker who smiles, sings, follows instructions and is completely unremarkable until he is mistaken for the Master Builder, the chosen one, who will fulfill an ancient prophesy, find the Piece of Resistance and thwart the evil plan of the tyrannical Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Accompanied by Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and her egotistical, vain boyfriend Batman (Will Arnett), Emmet journeys through every conceivable Lego theme in its universe on a mission to save their world from being glued together, and of personal discovery.Without doubt, The Lego Movie is a fantastic merchandising film. It is one long, feature length video catalogue that you can be thankful was released in the spring rather than prior to Christmas. But whereas The Internship was just a horrible, humourless Google commercial, The Lego Movie is a clever idea that entertains first and foremost. Oh, it's far less subtle than the product placement of Toy Story but you won't emerge feeling bludgeoned by the marketing bods.The plot is simple enough for the youngsters to follow but there is little time for boredom as the screen is constantly filled with action and movement and the dialogue rattles along with little time to reflect on the gags as they whiz by. As you'd expect, the scenery is beautifully constructed with Lego, the model numbers of bricks and components tumbling across the screen like Sherlock's (the BBC Benedict Cumberbatch incarnation) thoughts.The Lego Movie's 100 minute running time is perhaps too generous for the plot and its demographic, and there were too few children's giggles and too many shuffling bums but, if Roocayke was anything to go by, it will be a big hit with the under tens and an acceptable movie for the parents to enjoy rather the endure, as is more often the case. There are plenty of gags, references and in-jokes that sail over the youngsters' heads to entertain the adults and, though there is nothing to make us laugh out loud, The Lego Movie contains plenty to amuse.The vocal talent, too, will be of little interest to the kiddies but there is an impressive roster of stars having fun including half the cast of Star Wars and, in the battle of the scene thieves, Morgan Freeman (Vitruvius) narrowly beaten by Liam Neeson as Good Cop/Bad Cop. Add to that Alison Brie, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum...The Lego Movie is no Fankenweenie but it is a lot of fun. Just ask Roocayke. In amongst the gabble of enthusiasm that accompanied us home were two gems: ""I really liked the lady (Wyldstyle) but I don't want to marry her."" and ""Uncle Yed, I seriously want to see that again!"" The Lego Movie is not quite a joy, though it's certainly a pleasure. But be warned, it contains the nastiest brainworm on the big screen so far this year. It's a marketer's dream but an accompanying uncle's nightmare! Trust me on this: the drive home is a painful experience with a six-year old singing non-stop Everything is Awesome!

"EzioMonty117","14 February 2016","The Lego Movie is one of those films where you shouldn't judge a film by it's cover, making a film based on Lego's sounds stupid right? Yeah, but this film is far from stupid, it's the best animated film of 2014 and one of the funniest animated films of all time IMO, here's why.The story follows Emmet Brickowski, a ordinary Construction worker who lives a daily life in Bricksburg With his best friends, until he accidentally stumbles across a woman and starts following her which causes Emmet to fall Down a pit and finds the Piece of Resistance, since he found this piece, he is now considered the Chosen one and a master Builder even though he isn't one of them, since he is a Master Builder, he must stop Lord Business from taking over the world and With help by comedic side characters and many others.The film's characters are amazing, Batman is very funny and Bad Cop is the best character in the film IMO. I thought Benny was pointless and Unikitty was a bit annoying but i really like the other characters, especially The Man Upstairs.The film's humor is pretty good, many in-jokes and pop culture References that will keep you pumped up, especially the Terminator and Indiana Jones References shown in the Movie, there's many Visual jokes, verbal jokes and all kinds of humor thrown in.The film's live action scenes are pretty emotional and well crafted, because of the father and son relationship and the effects of The Man Upstairs breaking the Lego pieces, which causes the world to break as well.There is no real issues With the film, but the Everything is awesome song is annoying and the film is way too similar to The Matrix, but that's it really.The Lego Movie is a funny and clever animated film. The humor, Message, emotional scenes, Music, characters and plot is good, but some songs are annoying and the film is way too similar to The Matrix. Check this film out.10/10",NA
"TheMovieSnob247","6 July 2014","I didn't think much of this movie when I heard about it, but a friend recommended I see it and I'm glad he did. This is a fantastic film and one of the best of the year. I thought that it was very creative and the Lego style animation was really well done and unique. The highlight for me though is the voice over work by an all star cast. Chris Pratt (notably of Her, Parks and Recreation) and Elizabeth Banks (recently of The Hunger Games movies and 30 Rock) have the personality and wit to bring these characters to life. Will Ferrell, Will Arnett and Morgan Freeman also provide plenty of humour (yes, you read that right: Morgan Freeman was hilarious!).I also loved that the characters in the movie were a random mish-mash from comics, major Hollywood films and current pop culture and the adventure that ensures is ridiculously silly and a lot of fun. I laughed a lot more than I expected as this was very cleverly written (I had a hard time keeping with the humour at times as I was still laughing from a previous gag). As it concluded, it also took an unexpected and touching turn and reminds us that sometimes it's good to embrace uniqueness and think outside the box. A useful lesson for young and old alike and humorously ironic given the Lego toys this is based on. Funny, witty and surprisingly entertaining, this is not to be missed and is great fun for all ages.Was my review not horrible? Great!

"jaysanchu07","31 December 2021","Backed by fantastic animation, a nice story (though the message is blunt), catchy music and good humor, The Lego Movie is one entertaining film. Characters are really well depicted here as ALL OF THEM, from the main characters to the ""cameos"", are likeable with each having their own quirks and personalities. Overall, a film to recommend to people of all ages that has a knack for something fun, light and AWESOME. It's Lego after all!",NA
"osj2507","8 June 2015","This is very funny for both old and young, especially the younger crowd will see all the wonders that you can create with Lego :) and the grown ups just get the childhood back and it is riveting.I grew up with LEGO, being from Denmark it was a big part of what was the thing to play with, we even visited Lego Land in Jutland several times when I was a kid. This film really brings back happy times.But the film itself is also very well made and really has humor, great timing, a good story and much much more. There are small things everywhere, in the big scenes and in the dialogs and the characters not all is for the younger crowd, but it is enjoyable for all ages and there is never a dull moment.",NA
"shobana_ns","18 February 2014","Took my 2 children age 8 and 6, both Lego lovers, excepting to have a fun evening out with the kids. At the end of the movie, I was feeling bad that I had chosen to waste our precious time together on this nonsense.This movie is a soulless piece of junk. The story is disjointed, the visuals overwhelming, there is way too much violence (which sounds strange for a Lego movie, but there it is). My son was scared, my daughter bored, and I was VERY tempted to start checking work email, which may have provided more entertainment value.I cannot fathom how this movie that has gotten universal positive reviews.",NA
"Al_The_Strange","20 February 2014","Legos have always been my favorite toy. In fact, they still are. For as long as they've been around, it makes me wonder what took so long for somebody to make an official Lego movie.Then again, what kind of movie could possibly be made out of these silly little construction blocks? The biggest fear going into this movie is that it could have just been 90 minutes of senseless fluff. Even kids thought this would be stupid.Fortunately, the film overall proves to be quite sharp and clever for audiences of all ages. It breezes by at a brisk pace, loaded with fast-paced comedy and visually-striking action. Even during the film's most grim and dramatic parts (of which there are a few), the tone remains light, but without being too overbearing or sappy. The comedy keeps everything consistently fun and endearing, thanks to a ton of great random lines, sight gags, pop culture jokes, and some self-parody.What really makes this film work, however, is the substance. You'd think it'd be easy to write this film off as a mere marketing tool to sell more Legos (and it's probably working), but even then, The Lego Movie takes care to use Legos as the medium, more than a mere product to shove down our throats. With Legos as the film's primary canvas, the film immediately whisks us through a universe of colorful building blocks, complete with literal worldbuilding and mythos. The story treads on familiar ground; the characters inhabit familiar archetypes (I especially couldn't help but to draw comparisons between Emit and Neo from The Matrix; the wizard might as well fulfill the same role as Morpheus, and Wild Styles is much like Trinity), and the plot is molded in a formulaic epic-journey structure. What really makes this film brilliant, however, is the meta-fiction dynamic that becomes apparent as it goes on; it's a dynamic that made films like Cool World and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? novel, but The Lego Movie takes it a step further by tying in the story and themes together with (at least seemingly) earnest and heartfelt intentions.At it's core, The Lego Movie emphasizes creativity as the theme. It is the basis of the story's conflict, it is the focus of the characters, and it is the idea that resounds through the script. The film firmly declares that we are all special individuals, all capable of creating new, imaginative, unique things. Legos have always been a toy to nurture that creativity, and The Lego Movie is a celebration of the creative spirit. It is a theme that's not only inspiring for children, but also for the inner child. I believe this film supports one fundamental truth I've always believed in: it is more powerful to create than to destroy.This film is animated very distinctively with CGI that convincingly looks like stop-motion animation. It is all very colorful, well-rendered, well-textured, and has good-looking lighting. Movements are made to be a bit stiff on purpose, and it achieves the perfect effect of looking like a home-made feature. Voice-acting is great, and the script is pretty sharp. This production does a great job of replicating thousands and thousands of Lego pieces on-screen to create big imaginative worlds. Music can be strangely catchy too.The Lego Movie is to movies what LittleBigPlanet is to video games; they both have a seminal home-made look and charm, but with a firm focus on creativity and individual expression. Legos have been an endearing medium of creativity for years, and chances are that they'll remain on toystore shelves for more years to come. Even if this movie is merely a marketing tool, it is a well-made one with a lot of heart and spirit. I think the movie - and the toy - is quality entertainment for anybody young and old.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",NA
"gavinp9","2 January 2018","'The Lego Movie' is exactly what you expect, but also at the same time, something unexpected. It's a bright, fast-paced, well-intentioned kids' film, but it also has quite a few genuine laughs and touching moments - not that they're out of place, just that they add some levity to the story, which sometimes does get a little too ""meta"" for it's own good.The storyline is quite straightforward - ordinary guy gets thrust into an adventure to save the Universe, defeat the bad guy (Ferrell) and find love, even though he's ""normal"" - obviously, it turns out everyone's ""Special""/unique, not just those that are prominent. What makes it stand out is how they've taken something we all know & love - I doubt anyone born in the last 40 years hasn't played with Lego as a kid - and translated it to a living world. We get to see this through Emmet (Pratt)'s eyes and it's pretty funny how they integrate corporate America - coffee, music & TV shows - into this Lego world. And it's great how the Lego looks real and only animated to move facial effects - and the animated water is great. My favourite bit was seeing Ben the 'generic 80's astronaut' (Charlie Day) - and his enthusiasm for building spaceships - who even had an authentic helmet crack where the chin strap always broke! I remember building weird spaceships for him.One of my main issues is that they've gone to such great effort to animate this world, but then they fly through most of it so quickly that you don't actually get a chance to appreciate it all! Thanks to being a Warner Brothers film, we get the benefit of seeing DC characters - Wonder Woman, Superman, Green Lantern (a great sub-plot with these two!), and especially, Batman. The casting of Will Arnett as Batman is genius - his gravelly voice perfectly suited, as well as his comic timing. The ending - combining live action with the animation actually works - is pretty good and wraps everything up nicely, while also making you care for some of these characters, even if they're little yellow blocks!",NA
"japamo","26 November 2014","If the Academy Awards had a category for ""Fastest-Paced Feature"", I think ""The LEGO Movie"" (hereafter ""LEGO"") would slaughter any competition (even ""Hotel Transylvania"" – see my Amazon review). ""LEGO"" has an interlocking-brick universe to show us, so it hardly pauses for breath as it attempts to show it all – from cities to oceans to clouds to outer space to even, believe it or not, our own human world. The movie demands multiple viewings just to take all the spectacular visuals in.At an initial, casual glance, ""LEGO"" just seems concerned with being a movie-length commercial for the classic, versatile construction toy. And that it effectively is, but ""LEGO"" is insidiously so much more. Through a nondescript, super-ordinary construction worker Emmet Brickowski's (Chris Platt's) efforts to prove worthy of his ""special"" destiny and thwart Lord (President) Business's (Will Ferrell) goal to not only conquer the LEGO universe but also make it permanently in his own image with the ""Kragle"" (which is really sticky stuff), ""LEGO"" reassures us that we all have individual AND cooperative talents that can and deserve to be used to create great things.For most of ""LEGO"" though, we have our doubts about Emmet's ""specialness"". Oh, he's a pleasant and genial enough LEGO figure, but he seems to lead a severely regulated but unproductive and almost invisible life. But then by chance within the rubble of a construction site, he finds the red ""Piece De Resistance"", also sought after by Wyldstyle (real name: Lucy) (Elizabeth Banks), a nimble, technically adept ""Master Builder"" and street fighter. Because the ""Piece de Resistance"" is the only object that can neutralize the ""Kragle"", Wyldstyle thinks that Emmet is the ""Special"" or chosen one prophesized to defeat Lord Business. Before Emmett knows it, Wyldstyle brings him to meet other Master Builders led by the blind sage Vetruvius (Morgan Freeman) also determined to stop the egotistical tyrant. Despite Vetruvius's and Wyldstyle's encouragement and guidance, Emmett has a very tough time living up to the prophecy. He vainly protests that not only is he not ""special"", he's not even a Master Builder.As Emmett and company careen through the LEGO universe, Emmet's ego takes more of a beating as he meets a vast cast of characters from practically every action picture, comic, and cartoon ever made (from Milhouse Van Houten to Superman) who are all talented and/or Master Builders. Most damaging to Emmet's self-esteem is his rival for Wyldstyle's affections, none other than Lego Batman himself (Will Arnett), pumped up with humorless (but funny) self-importance and sense of duty. And these guys are his allies! As for the villains, aided by the schizophrenic Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson), Lord Business cuts an imposing figure as he uses his ""Galactus"" helmet, his telescoping legs, and his huge law enforcement army to cement his rule. Maybe Emmet is out of his league.Then things start to click as Emmet sacrifices himself to save all the Master Builders, imprisoned by Business in a Think Tank. He plunges into our dimension and into a basement occupied by 8-year old Finn (Jadon Sand), whose own dilemma mirrors Emmet's and may be even controlling Emmet and the other Lego people (no wonder ""LEGO"" seems to be directed by a child's wild flights of storytelling fancy, because it kinda is.) Finn's defiance of his father's (Will Ferrett in real life) stifling of his own imagination gives Emmett the courage to go back to ""LEGOland"" and confront Business in a surprising but calm and life-affirming climax.LEGO offers boundless, wholesome (except maybe for the pantsless guy in the situation comedy, but don't worry, he's not anatomically correct.:) ) creative fun for people for all ages. But most impressively, LEGO painstakingly convinces us that we all have special talents and skills that should never be suppressed and that can contribute to the betterment of everyone's life. Yep, everyone is special. And that's just awesome!",NA
"iamgamerkier1234","24 February 2014","I watched this yesterday at 2:30pm its now 9:10am and i cannot help but think of this film. I think of the animation the jokes then the little subtle jokes that younger kids wouldn't get and then the beautiful animation and the voice work by Chris Pratt and others i cannot find a single fault with this film i don't have one maybe the song was annoying but i ended up buying the album off iTunes (Everything is awesome) i hated it at first and i now love it i cannot think of a fault with this movie. Its kinda like a social commentary with following instructions and all that and president business voiced brilliantly by Will Ferrell. I found that kids might not respect this movie as much as adults cause there are jokes they will not get I'm honest i heard more GROWN MEN laugh than some of the children. OK the voice acting is outstanding all round my personal favourite is Bad cop voiced by Liam Neeson the voices are great all round. The last 15 minutes are really heart felt and i couldn't believe that they did that. I will be honest some of the jokes did fall flat and where funny but just didn't lift off like some the others did but thats minor compared to the other jokes and this is a laugh out loud movie and i love this film to death i will go far as to say i enjoyed this a little more than Monsters inc (my favourite animated film in my top 20 at 19) and i would say this has just taken my number 18 spot i love this film i recommend it for all ages and family's.",NA
"xiaoli7377","13 April 2022","This movie reminded me so much of childhood, playing with Lego pieces (or other toys) and letting my imagination run wild with the stories and characters that I would create. This one reminds me a lot of ""Toy Story"", except for the fact that the plot thematically revolves around creativity and uniqueness a lot more, which is a great message for kids. Embrace your imagination.The animation is awesome, the filmmakers really put in work to make it look exactly as if it were made with stop-motion effects like a lot of homemade Lego movies tend to be. The cast is also stellar. Chris Pratt, Morgan Freeman, and Liam Neeson are all great.An amazing movie, one of the best animated films of the 2010s.",NA

But coming back and watching it again it still is an awesome movie and just like how I remembered it and probably one of my favorite animated films. The idea in this movie was so ridiculous that it turned to be great and very creative seriously.Solid story with action fast pacing and positive messages. The writing and directing were very good, funny and with great camera moves. Characters are decent. You got Emmet , the main character who has good development throughout. Wyldstyle, who may seem tough from the outside but has a good heart inside. And a couple of other characters such as Batman who was hilarious and vitruvius the wise old man. The visuals were fantastic especially for a lego movie. And the music was diverse with likable voice acting.Overall an enjoyable film.Memorable:No Rewatchable: Most likely..",NA

"rooee","24 February 2014","This very amusing and imaginative film from the makers of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs absolutely delighted the children in our auditorium, to the point where one kid cried out, ""This is the best film EVER!"" I wouldn't go that far, but in the afterglow of Pixar's Golden Age, it's definitely one of the better ones.The plot concerns Emmet Brickowski, an everyman (voiced by Chris Pratt) – everyfigure? – thrust into the role of ""Master Builder"", on a quest to vanquish the dastardly Lord Business (Will Ferrell). Business, president of Octan Corporation and the world, intends to glue everyone in their place. Emmet and his crew are out to stop him through the power of ideas – e.g. building and re-building stuff. It's a modern American story, initially about individualism and entrepreneurism, and later about cooperation; sort of an anti-superhero film, with a light subversive streak.The plot is fairly generic, but there are numerous surreal interludes throughout the film. Mostly these are enjoyable (I loved the visual allusion to 2001: A Space Odyssey), but there are certain 'fourth wall' scenes toward the end of the film that I found a bit sinister. I mean, obviously the film is an advert for Lego, but is there really a need to make the marketing so manipulative? The ""Man Upstairs"" scenes unashamedly employ soft-focus sentimentality to associate the product directly with parental love. Obviously young kids aren't going to care much about the ideological use of marketing, but I think the otherwise perfectly laudable message of the film was enough without these overwrought scenes.Now, back to the good stuff.I don't know what methods were used to create the look of The Lego Movie, and now I've seen it I don't want to know. It may be all CG, but it has the look of stop-motion. It has a charming jerky grace which is unique in modern mainstream animation. The action scenes are frame-hoppingly chaotic, but I think this works nicely, capturing the way that children arrange their toys in tableaux (although they probably wouldn't use the word ""tableaux"").In the main role, Pratt plays the part with dorky charm, while Ferrell channels his best Mugato as the villain. Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson are on rare loose form as Vitruvius and Bad Cop/Good Cop respectively. My personal favourite is Batman, played by Will Arnett as a bitter, self-absorbed bully.Product tie-ins could well be the shape of things to come, and if they can always be this smart and funny then I say bring them on. Manufacturers have made toys based on films for decades. This time it's simply being done the other way around – and it proves that the result needn't be Transformers.",NA
"kdnor2011","2 June 2014","So I had heard that The Lego Movie was really, really good, and yeah, it really was. There was so much to like in this movie, it was funny, creative, dramatic at points, fast paced, entertaining, and has a really good moral. There are cameos from some of our favorite characters that I won't dare spoil for anyone. And did I mention that it was funny, because it is, it's really, really funny. This is my kind of humor, fast paced with a lot of sarcastic moments that border on anti-humor. The characters, not just the copyrighted ones, are likable, entertaining and feel developed. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family, in fact there were only a couple of things I found wrong with the film at all.One involved it's pacing, which is incredibly fast. For the most part it works and it does know to slow down once in a while, however sometimes a scene that should have been dramatic or slow paced goes by so fast or has so many jokes or jokes at the wrong moment that it ruins the drama. Then there is the ending, which while funny and very heartwarming seemed really confusing and brought up a lot of questions.Yet this film is a blast from start to finish and I hope they make a sequel.",NA
"coreyjdenford","25 January 2015","This original creative animation is fantastic and fun for all the family Chris Pratt who plays Emmett is a builder like everybody else at least that's what he thinks. Emmett is just an ordinary guy in an extraordinary city and really turns out that he copies everything that everyone else does. He meets a woman named Lucy/Wildstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and she trusts him to find his skill to be a megabuilder. They go on this great adventure which along the way they meet some extraordinary characters and they all fight together to save the world my favourite part is when Good Cop/Bad Cop is played Liam Neeson and also when they go into the real world with Will Ferrell playing the little lad's father and they get along so well at the end. Fantastic fun for all the family. 10/10.",NA
"TyTanner","9 April 2014","The 1949 popular line of construction toys – Lego – has made it on to the big screen. It only took 65 years. Actually, that's not true: Lego-based series such as Bionicle, Hero Factory, Lego Star Wars, the short animation of Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego, and the film Lego Batman: The Movie - DC Super Heroes Unite, have all preceded The Lego Movie, so the concept is not exactly fresh. It is however, the first big Hollywood blockbuster – only a matter of time – and it won't be the last (The Lego Movie 2 has been approved for release in 2017).There are few iconic films these days born from original ideas – most are recycled ideas given new angles. So because the recycled style of film is what audiences have come to expect, we are instinctively impressed when an idea has been effectively reconditioned. The Lego Movie falls in to that 'automatically stimulated' category for many viewers, because yes, it's directed, produced and written well, but it's not new. Here's why it warrants three stars out of five (or 6/10 for IMDb).No animated film is without a villain, conflict, and some degree of fighting, but The Lego Movie's violence stood out – most noticeably the scene where Vitruvius is decapitated, along with the arrest of several civilians who are electrocuted, shouting in pain, not to mention the whole 'destruction of the city' theme, and the plan to destroy everyone with permanent glue.While all violence is 'Lego violence' intended to be taken ever so lightly, and is predictably, the imagination of Finn - a real person (Jadon Sand) - it's the fact it is the imagination of a child which is of concern. Will Ferrell's eight-year-old kid, crafts the whole 'President Business is destroying the world' premise based on his father's (President Business's) actions. Ferrell is stifling his kid's (the Lego people's) imagination, and is adamant to maintain control over his world. This is unnerving on a couple of levels – the fact a father is so steadfast in not allowing his son to play with toys designed for children (and adults), and also that Finn concocts such a vehement storyline as a result of this.So was the transition to the live action scenes necessary?For younger viewers, the parallel of the two story-lines is something they wouldn't understand to great effect. But for young adults and anyone older, a message about the degree of which adulthood imposes itself over childhood – initially as a discouragingly and damagingly force – is an issue which gives us something to contemplate.Emmet, the film's protagonist, journeys from an ordinary character to a 'special' individual - much like a child with a clear mind which becomes filled with the experiences of a maturing adult. And Lego itself does possess that unique quality of breaking the confines of age.But the overpowering idea of the majority of the film about the negative imposition of parents over their children (a.k.a. the Big Brother supremacy over its people) is certainly noteworthy, maybe even alarming. And although we have our mainstream and compulsory happy conclusion, emphasising individual thought and family values above all, almost the entire movie gives us a somewhat disconcerting view of the adult values in a child's upbringing – but maybe this is a good issue to bring to the forefront?That being said, the foreseeable switch to the live action was a let down, anyway. Maybe this part was too involved for its own good.The film does do a good job however, of giving rise to other involved ideas. Lord Business is the epitome of current day capitalism and commercialism, and at the same time the entire concept places firm roots in George Orwell's classic 1984 novel – a dystopian world of enduring war; pervasive government surveillance; and public manipulation; controlled by an elite political group which oppresses independent thinking.Looking at distinctive scenes in the film, such as punishment for not following instructions, and cutting ties between parent and child (when Bad Cop freezes his folks), there are many more specific parallels to be drawn between this movie and 1984. So here, the film does exceptionally well in recapturing Orwell's timeless, not-so-fictional- novel, for a new generation of viewers.Adult-specific cultural references and jokes made within the film are constructed well too, as are the parodies of other movies.How about 'Cloud Cuckoo Land' - one of the realms featured in the movie - a land with no rules and reached by travelling up a rainbow. Maybe a cultural reference to the concept of heaven? A reference that could imply such notions invented through various religious groups are in fact cuckoo? Or am I drawing a long bow here? The concluding triumph of individual creations and breaking free from vanilla instructions over a Nanny state is also in direct contrast to what the actual Lego product is all about – a company which wants you to build structures according to very specific guidelines.So does this movie, which at first brings up the serious issue of the degree to which adulthood enforces its values on childhood experiences, then comes to a resolution of individual thought, actually follow its own advice and think for itself? Not so much. Although its recycled ideas certainly do work to an extent.From a pure child's perspective, if those few acts of hostility were left out, as well as the switch to the real people, it could have been better, but that would have changed the dimensions of some of the adult references.Having said that, The Lego Movie had opening weekend figures in Australia over $5.7 million, a figure second only to Captain American: The Winter Soldier. And it will no doubt do wonders for the sales of those colourful building blocks... I forget what they're called.",NA
"rbn_lrk-1","25 June 2015","If you have noticed putting live action segments into a cartoon is as trend these days.Anyway, I was raised near Billund where Legoland opened in the 1960's.Many rides and shows had went and go.From the vanished 3D shows to shows with dolls.Loads of LEGO movies and shows was made for DVD and VHS.Rows of LEGO games came out like LEGO LOCO.Finally in 2014 the LEGO movie was released in the cinemas.We follow a LEGO man that lives his ordinary life.But later on he must save the World.It all ends in a Live Action dimension.The climax ends abrupt, and leaves place for the upcoming second LEGO movie.Watch the movie over and over again, as there are an explosion of details.Set the volume to max too.The LEGO maniacs will have their field day here.10/10",NA
"arthuradam","8 April 2014","Wow, just wow! Having grown up with Lego through the 70's & 80's and liking nerdy things (Star Wars, Super Heroes and fantasy/Dundeons & Dragons), this movie was just pure awesomeness . Along with the nerd-fest, the CGI (computer graphics) actually looks more like old school stop-start motion animation. To be honest, I have grown to hate CGI. It is over used and has a certain cheap look to it. The animation based company that did the animations in this film have achieved perfection here by making the movie look like stop-start motion animation and creating a sense that the Lego is real. A big thumbs up to the Australian CGI company that was hired for this job. Oh yeah, the Star Wars scene was awesome.",NA

"bix171","15 January 2015","Sweet, sincere and hysterically funny, ""The Lego Movie"" has an inspired crew working at a whirlwind pace to create dazzling visuals and very witty gags that both honor and gently lampoon the world of Lego. The result is a propulsive gem, a near-masterpiece that immediately envelops you and is able to maintain a consistency all the way through to its unexpectedly moving live-action conclusion. There's no sense in going through the plot, which is just a set-up for a series of chases through hallucinatory settings, but the film's flaw is contained there in its unnecessary send-ups of big business and religion; the movie needs them, I suppose, to give the plot its purpose, but they're not very developed and if the writers (which include the directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller) were trying to make points, they're not quite there. Far more successful is the relationship between adults and children from which the story germinates. But all that is secondary: with such entertaining material and such virtuosity in animation, it's hard not to absolutely fall in love. And of course, there's the song ""Everything Is Awesome"" which will tattoo itself onto your brain the first time you hear it.",NA

"The_moan_of_all_moans","12 February 2014","I am not the biggest fan of animated films; a lot of them just pass me by and that's fine. But every now and then there is one that stands out and i feel inclined to go see it. From the trailer it was apparent that ""Lego Movie"" was going to be one of those stand out films. From the get go It showed quick witted quirky humor; catering to both the young and the older audience. It is funny, plain and simple. It mixes silly comedy with well thought out wit and the timing is at points impeccable. The story is that of a usual animated film; an underdog overcomes his mundane , mediocre life to become a hero. It's a standard plot in most animated films. But this brings a sharpness to it that others don't. The time breezes past and you can't help but enjoy it. And the visuals? Well they excellent and add to the enjoyment.A great film where the only disappointment was the 2 devilish children to my right. One of which didn't seem to grasp the concept of their juice being finished and continued to suck on the straw anyway. The other feeling inclined to stomp his feet throughout....ah the joys of children eh? Those two demons aside it was a very good film - 7.5/10",NA
"luke-a-mcgowan","12 May 2015","The Lego Movie really can be summed up in its signature song, Everything is Awesome. It is a colourful, delightful romp that is equal parts quality viewing and mindlessly entertaining. It is a movie for all occasions and audiences. The animation is delightfully done, giving the impression of stop-motion animation to fully create what it would be like to act out this movie with real Lego.Directors Lord and Miller have assembled a stellar voice cast, giving perfect characters to each of its actors - the seductive Elizabeth Banks, the cute Alison Brie, the wise Morgan Freeman, the enthusiastic Charlie Day and the tough Liam Neeson. Chris Pratt and Will Arnett (the latter being the most underrated comedic actor alive) are the film's highlights as protagonist Emmet and rival Batman.The story is simply superb. Not only is it an interesting and engaging story, it captures everything we love about Lego. Anyone who has ever played with any Lego set knows the battle between imagination and instructions. Will Ferrell's President Business is the most perfect villain the film could have. The weapons and arguments used by each side are so perfect and no audience will have trouble identifying with one side or another.Making a movie about Lego is something that I know tweaked a lot of noses, but it really created something incredible here. The ability to tap into almost anything - LOTR, Harry Potter, The Simpsons, the NBA and DC Comics (with voice acting from 21 Jump Street duo Tatum and Hill providing some huge laughs) - means that this movie had no boundaries, and indeed that is a huge reason why I loved it. It also provided vital jokes and story archs - see quotes like ""does anyone know what this piece is, and do you need it?"" for just one example.Towards the end of the movie there is a revelation that truly changes the entire scope of the film, and that makes the film even more special. In any sense, The Lego Movie is one of those movies you can watch again and again and again, never getting over the laughs or the colour or the fun. I cannot recommend this highly enough.",NA
"troy-daniel-bush","2 June 2023","A smartly-written and beautifully animated satire with memorable characters, hilarious gags, and a talented cast that clearly had fun with the material. And the filmmakers' love for Legos, action movies, and animated films shines through in more ways than one.While all of the voice-acting was great and everyone had a distinct character, Liam Neeson steals the show for me, and Bad Cop was my favorite character in the whole movie.It was one of those rare movies where I had high hopes going into the theater, and my expectations were met and surpassed.Where the movie goes is incredibly satisfying and unpredictable, as well.",NA
"ghost_dog86","15 February 2014","Don't worry, this is not just a nostalgia movie catering to the retro LEGO nerd, while alienating anybody who had video games or friends growing up. ""The Lego Movie"" is shockingly entertaining, even if you're like me and the only LEGO interaction you've ever had is that one time when you accidentally stepped barefoot on one of your little brothers LEGO pieces.Side Note: Yes, I am aware that there are Lego video games, but those are lame, so Containing Star Wars LEGO jokes, Harry Potter LEGO jokes, Ninja Turtle LEGO jokes and Superhero (The Justice League) LEGO jokes (with LEGO Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) portrayed accurately as a jerk, or how a billionaire playboy turned Superhero would most likely act in real life) ""The Lego Movie"" is from the minds of writer/director duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (the writer/directors of such child friendly films as ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" and""21 Jump Street"").Synopsis: An average construction worker LEGO man (voiced by Chris Pratt) is mistaken for a LEGO prophet after stumbling upon a mysterious piece of plastic known as ""The Piece of Resistance"" and then asked to save the LEGO universe from the tyrannical President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell). To tell you the truth, I was actually dreading going to see ""The Lego Movie"", after taking one glance at the trailer and believing that it was just another animated, early year, straight to DVD release that the studios were attempting to masquerade as a feature film. BUT, to my surprise, what I got was an animated feature which contained the foundation of an extremely clever script riddled with laugh-out-loud dialogue, together with quite impressive LEGO inspired visuals (LEGO-mation) that while does take a few moments to adjust to, should force this film into the awards conversation next year.Caveat: Chances are ""The Lego Movie"" will be more entertaining for adults than small children, and here's why: Written by the guys who wrote and directed ""21 Jump Street"", most of the jokes caught me off guard with how comically sharp they were, but after a while I did notice numerous children, in the theater I was in, becoming visibly bored with the witty banter, while their parents continued to laugh out loud until the final credits rolled. Something to think about if you are planning on taking your little one.Final Thought (Caveat # 2): As funny as ""The Lego Movie"" is, it is also hampered by an overly sentimental and tonally misguided ending, which takes most of the wind out of the sails of the final twenty minutes. This was actually the biggest problem I had with the film, even getting to the point of openly wishing it would end, just so I wouldn't have to witness one more second of Will Ferrell showing off his non-range as a dramatic actor. Still, if you are a fan of LEGO's or any offshoot of LEGO brand video games, then you will more than likely be able to outright ignore any flaws ""The Lego Movie"" has to offer.",NA
"scottspurs","26 February 2014","Lego Movie in my opinion could go down as one the biggest surprises ever in cinema history. I know the Lego franchise has gone waayy beyond expectations with the toys, models and gaming industry (Lego Harry Potter, Lego Star Wars etc etc), but a Lego film I never thought would work, and if one was released, it would be so childish I would never lay eyes on it...... How wrong could I be, as this film could easily have just made it in AT LEAST my top 50 of all time.First of all, this film will probably only appeal to so many friends, unless you're all super perfectly in sync with another. I saw this tonight with 3 other people, and only 1, as well as myself were laughing throughout, the other 2, didn't get any of the humour at all. The humour is witty, very immature in places, but perfectly timed. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE QUOTE THE FILM FOREVER FILMS!However as funny as this film is, and as much as I have already quoted Batman in the past 2 hours since seeing the film, it's not the humour that has pushed this film waaaaay beyond expectations. Without giving too much away, this film has a really deep back story, and a massive surprise towards the end with the story entering a world that I never thought would exist in the film, and it really did help explain why the film was as random as it was, and just brought everything together. Kudos Lego Movie, Kudos.Can not wait to add this to my blu ray collection (the film is stunning).",NA
"mistoppi","11 September 2015","The world in this movie is amazing. It feels limitless and imaginative - which exactly has always been the strength of the Legos. I love how they didn't just make a dumb funny movie, but actually captivated the power the toys have always had. Another amazing thing about the world is how it plays with many levels of reality. Of course there are the many different worlds in the Lego worlds, but that isn't all, as you can guess by the 'Man from upstairs'. The plot is good. It is of course simple, but what do you expect from a movie that suits for the whole family.The humour is amazing - it has many different types of humour, since it's meant for people of all ages to enjoy. And the animation! I loved it, it looks so much fun compared to the typical Disney Pixar -type of animation. Definitely a good movie. It should have won the Academy Award for best animation, simply because it's so much fun and it feels like there are so many different philosophical themes one could talk of.",NA

"Aleta_Nook","7 March 2015","I found myself not engaged with the film as I was with ""The Boxtrolls"", some of the CGI character design and animation for the heroes is your standard character design and animation like Disney. And it wasn't all that special, but it was more enjoyable than The Boxtrolls on many levels. But it should've been nominated for an Academy Award because it's better than 'Big Hero 6' also, that little-teen, generic movie. I found 'Mr. Peabody & Sherman' a better movie than The Boxtrolls and kept me engaged throughout despite a little brat in there. Unlike ""Big Hero 6"", it actually makes you laugh throughout the film. It also makes you feel scared of the villain, pretty much the most well-thought out character I've seen in a while.I got this movie on DVD, expecting something cute and surprisingly breathtaking like ""Wreck it Ralph"" but it was somewhat boring like 'Big Hero 6' with some entertaining parts. The movie is too weird like Emmet can get annoying with his talkative self and Unikitty (I don't remember much about her).The ending was an okay one, but it was just added in there as a cloying part. It was too sad, too, but then everything's okay.I don't think that many people over the age of 9 will enjoy this thoroughly.All in all, The Lego Movie is an overrated film that is not for everyone and I really recommend Wreck-it Ralph more. It was an engaging and hilarious film from start to finish that will be something to watch over and over again. Don't expect much special from it.",NA
