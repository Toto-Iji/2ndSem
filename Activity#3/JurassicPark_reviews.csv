"Pjtaylor-96-138044","10 June 2018","'Jurassic Park (1993)' is a landmark achievement, in as many ways as possible. While some of the exclusively digital dinosaurs don't hold up quite as well as the rest (despite having been only relatively recently surpassed by their peers - depending on budgetary constraints, of course), there are times when the superb CG almost seamlessly blends with possibly the best practical effects I've ever seen to create phenomenally believable, groundbreaking special-effects that truly are, still to this day, some of the best of their kind. Seriously, both the Raptor rigs and, specifically, the to-scale T-Rex are nothing short of breathtaking. They work so well not only due to the flick's fantastic technical prowess but also thanks to its beautiful blending of its core techniques (those created by clay and those by computer), its legitimate reactions from the compelling characters and its uncanny ability to put the audience right in the middle of it all, making you feel genuine wonder, fear, suspense and elation as if you're really sat alongside these long-extinct creatures. It's difficult to stress just how important the characters are in making it all so utterly believable, as well as so utterly captivating. Each of them feel like fleshed-out people, written to perfection by screenwriters who know how to get information across to the audience in a very organic way. It's almost as entertaining watching these people just converse with one another, discussing the morals of bringing extinct creatures back from the dead, as it is seeing them navigate the survival situation in which they are inevitably placed. It is only because we care so much about all the core players that the suspense sequences work so well, that we are kept on the edge of our seat every time a dinosaur lurks around the corner and that we grip our chairs when they leap for their prey. These scenes are some of the best in cinema, perfectly constructed with restraint and splendour. It's also difficult to describe how affecting even the simple moments can be, the moments in which we are asked to sit back and stare at the mere sight of a dinosaur. These should have dampened with time and yet they haven't, still eliciting the awe they did when they first hit the big-screen. They emulate the imagined magic of seeing one of these animals in real life for the first time. Running underneath all of this are some compelling themes that eagerly invite analysis, with the central debate being a tough and intriguing one. The picture is simply one of the most engaging I've ever seen, one that puts an ear-to-ear smile on your face just because it's so utterly amazing. It balances all of its core tenants impeccably, being a proper 'summer blockbuster' that's incredibly intelligent as well, to the point that every second is just supreme entertainment. It can make you lean forward in your seat or well-up with awe and, in general, have a blast from beginning to end. The movie is, without a doubt, a true masterpiece. 10/10","

"planktonrules","11 May 2013","By now there are nearly a thousand (not really a bazillion) reviews for this Steven Spielberg film. So, in the case of mega-hits where there is a strong consensus that the movie is exceptional (and I don't disagree), what more is there to say?! Apart from a few characters who seemed a bit one-dimensional (which is a minor problem in an action film) and the unwritten Spielberg rule that kids cannot die (taking away much of the suspense), the film is amazing. While the CGI isn't quite as beautiful as what we can do today, it STILL looks awesome. With only a few exceptions, the dinosaurs LOOK real! And, the music from John Williams is, as expected, very good. Overall, a highly entertaining film which will no doubt please everyone except for the impossible to please.","

"FrankBooth_DeLarge","5 September 2005","In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn't seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn't the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn't even in the top 250. Today, people don't appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90's, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn't understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn't bad, but the third wasn't very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone's life is at stake.The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren't scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.Enjoy","

"Smells_Like_Cheese","18 November 2003","My first epic movie to see on the big screen was Jurassic Park. I was only 8 years old and I had no idea what I was in for when I watched this movie. I was terrified but so enchanted by this world. Steven Spielberg brought back the dinosaur genre, a genre that was only used with caveman movies. Not to mention did it with incredible special effects. I remember seeing this movie for the first time and asked my mom if the dinosaurs were real or if they made giant robots. Those dinosaurs not only looked real but were absolutely terrifying. But what an adventure we took with Jurassic Park, the land where anything could happen with a crazy billionaire and upset employees who pretty much destroy the world for a nickel. One of the most memorable movies of all time that still holds up to this day, Jurassic Park is a film not to be missed.Billionaire John Hammond, has recently created Jurassic Park: a theme park populated with dinosaurs cloned from the DNA extracted from insects preserved in prehistoric amber. After a park worker is attacked by a dinosaur, Hammond's investors, demand that experts visit the park and verify that it is safe. Gennaro invites Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician, while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler. They are joined on the island by Hammond's two grandchildren Tim and Lex. Hammond asks Malcolm, Grant, and Sattler what their thoughts are about having recreated dinosaur species. The group sets off to explore the park. The head computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, is secretly in the employ of one of InGen's corporate rivals, and has been paid to steal fertilized dinosaur embryos. During his theft, Nedry deactivates the park's security system, allowing him access to the embryo storage. The group is now parked in front of the T-Rex's cage and now they are fighting for their lives in Jurassic Park.I think one of the most memorable scenes is definitely the raptors chasing the children in the kitchen. What a tense scene that made you hold your breath the whole way through. You have to love Jeff Goldblum in this movie, when he tries to ""save"" the children from the T-Rex and instead pretty much gets his butt kicked, he gets saved later and as they are chased in the car by the T-Rex the only thing he can say as this giant monster is catching up faster and faster with each footstep, he says ""must go faster"" so calmly, how funny! But there is a moment that scares me more than the dinosaurs that I'm surprised no one noticed in the editing room, the granddaughter is scared to death screaming at Sam Neill that the lawyer left them and he replies with a dark look ""that's not what I'm going to do"". I responded that with ""I have much darker plans for you"", I mean his look was just so creepy! I digress, Jurassic Park is still a very fun movie that is the ultimate adventure. It's timeless and I can't wait to show my kids one day, what a great movie with wonderful effects and a wonderful cast and crew.9/10","

"TheLittleSongbird","30 March 2010","I personally really like Steven Spielberg, and I like his films, especially Schindlers List, Jaws and ET:The Extra Terrestrial. While a tad too long and has one or two loose ends in the plot, Jurassic Park nevertheless has thrilling action and has sheer evidence of the director's vision and effortless verve at work. John Williams's score is absolutely terrific, definitely one of the more memorable scores in a Steven Spielberg movie, the score for Jaws like Psycho is one of the main reason why I am so scared to go into the sea now. The acting is really not bad at all, Sam Neill and Laura Dern have given better performances but they were good. Jeff Goldblum is terrific, and as Dennis Nedry Wayne Knight is suitably more subdued. Richard Attenborough, a talented actor and a even more talented director also is good as John Hammond, while child star Joseph Mazello, who surprised me in Shadowlands is appealing as Tim. However, the real stars are the dinosaurs, especially the T-Rex, the mix of computer animation and models is inspiring. The cinematography is astounding, the script is good and the direction is lively. I haven't read Michael Crichton's book, but regardless this is a hugely enjoyable film. 9/10 Bethany Cox","

"AlsExGal","27 March 2017","The biggest attraction of this film back in 1993, of course, was the realistic computer graphic animation of the dinosaurs by SGI coupled with the realistic sound effects and the good use of suspense built around them both.After I first saw this movie in the theatre 24 years ago, I laid in bed awake for hours, not from fright, but from the lingering excitement of the entire experience. Up to that time, nothing like it had ever been done on that scale. This is hard to remember when, since then, the Discovery Channel came up with the whole ""Walking with ..."" series of documentaries on dinosaurs, early man, and creatures before the dinosaur that use the same techniques that this film did, and thus people have become accustomed to this level of realism in animation both on the small and large screen.Thus with the ""shock value"" of the animation removed, this movie doesn't seem quite as ""5-star"" as it did during its first run. The dialogue, in particular, seems a bit thin now. One aspect of the movie that still impresses me that doesn't get much mention is the outstanding use of sound and sound effects. For example, when the T-Rex first appears in the movie, it is not just the sight of the thing that terrifies, but its tremendous roar. It is still great action adventure viewing for the entire family.","

"josiahliljequist","11 June 2019","If you were born in the 90s or before, you had a connection with people...you absolutely loved this movie, and it made a mark on you. I think most people remember when they saw this movie first, because it was that awe inspiring of an experience. I remember that it was the first pg-13 movie I was allowed to watch, and what a way to start my grown up movie experience!!!
Everything in this movie screams adventure, from the opening scene where the jungle leaves rustle, the shot of mysterious sparkling amber, to the landing of the helicopter on a remote rainforest island, the movie sets the tone for the greatest adventure movie ever made. As you hear John Williams glorious theme start to swell, and you see Alan remove his glasses and start to tremble, you know you're about to witness one of the most magical moments ever put on cinema. I can't go into detail on all the incredible scenes, from the T-Rex reveal, to the kitchen scene, but each one of them revolutionized what we thought movie magic could take us. Thank you Spielberg for making this enchanting piece of art for us, an entire generation is indebted to you.","

"MichaelM24","6 July 2001","JURASSIC PARK was the film that ignited my interest in filmmaking and drove me to get a degree in it, so I will always have a soft spot for it. I was eleven when I read the book, but all the technical stuff lost me and I never finished it. A couple years later when I heard the movie was coming out, I decided I would just see it instead. With advance tickets selling out fast, my mom was lucky enough to get some a few days before it's premiere. We stood in line for roughly thirty minutes before we finally got in. Even as the lights were dimming, I still had no idea what to expect. Within moments I was glued to my seat. The opening sequences remains one of my favorite scenes in any film and continues to give me goosebumps to this day. For the next two hours, I sat in my seat just staring at the screen as these marvelous, life-like creatures that were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The film was full of awe and scares. I walked out of the theater virtually trying to catch my breath. What a thrill ride the film had been, and I eventually went back and saw it a few more times. The film was a turning point in my life, as I said, because I walked out saying to myself, ""That's what I want to do."" Sure the characters aren't deep and the dialogue isn't great, but who cares when the film is this entertaining? The actors are good in their parts, especially the always great Sam Neill, and the dinosaurs are incredibly life-like. The action is great, and the pacing (after a slow start) is relentless. The film has a few continuity flaws, but none of them matter. This film is great entertainment.","

"Leofwine_draca","25 April 2012","I'm no great fan of Steven Spielberg. He makes films that should interest me, but all too often ruins the experience by being overly sentimental. Take his WAR OF THE WORLDS remake as a case in point: it had the potential to be a fantastic movie, but thanks to the ridiculous plot twists I can't ever bring myself to watch it again. However, JURASSIC PARK, despite containing an overload of sentimentality, manages to be a simply great movie, a classic in fact, thanks to an overwhelming amount of elements that work.Michael Crichton's story is fresh (if you overlook the fact that it's Westworld with dinosaurs) and inventive. Okay, I wish Spielberg had made this film for adults rather than kids – complete with the graphic bloodshed of the original novel – but then I guess I wouldn't have seen it in the cinema at the age of 12 and been hugely influenced by it. The cast is splendid, particularly Sam Neill, one of those rarely-seen character actors who really deserved the big time success he enjoyed with his role here. Goldblum is even better, although much underutilised in favour of the redundant Laura Dern character. Watch out for Wayne Knight and Sam Jackson in memorable bit parts and try to avoid the annoyingly precocious brats played by Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards. Bob Peck's big game hunter, straight out of the pages of a H. Rider Haggard novel, is a complete scene stealer.Of course, this is one of those rare movies where the actors come second to the special effects, and the mixture of CGI and animatronic models is still breathtaking to this day. The scene where the T-Rex escapes is hands down one of the most suspenseful moments in cinema, ever. Okay, what follows is occasionally ridiculous (the car dropping down the tree scene) and involves kids running around too much, but it's still the kind of breathlessly exciting movie that there aren't all that many of.I still remember feeling a little bit jealous of how this movie popularised dinosaurs in the mainstream. As a kid, I'd always loved the creatures and owned loads of books about them, but after JURASSIC PARK every kid in the world fell in love with them and it was never the same. I ended up a little jaded, as I'd wanted to stay in that little niche on my own. Anyway, I digress: this is an outrageously good family movie, one of those films with a little bit of everything in it for everyone, and one I can wholeheartedly recommend and enjoy over and over again.","

"Tweekums","28 June 2017","After a worker is killed in an accident at the dinosaur theme park 'Jurassic Park' owner John Hammond calls in experts Dr Alan Grant and Dr Ellie Sattler as well as mathematician Ian Malcolm to visit it the park and clear it to open to the public. 'Jurassic Park' is no ordinary theme park; it is on a remote island off the coast of Costa Rica and it contains real dinosaurs! It is explained how these have been created by extracting dinosaur DNA from blood in mosquitoes preserved in amber. The first ones the visitors see are harmless herbivores but they are told that the park also contains some of the most famous carnivores such as Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor; something that both excites and concerns the scientists. After an introduction the visitors, along with Hammond's grandchildren, Lex and Tim, and the company lawyer take part in a tour of the park. As they travel things go wrong for two reasons; a tropical storm is heading for the island and, more importantly, a corrupt company employee as set up a computer program that will turn off various security systems including the electric fences that protect the guests so he can attempt to steal dinosaur DNA sell it to a competitor. Once things do go wrong those on the tour find themselves fleeing for their lives following a T Rex attack on their vehicles while those at the park headquarters try to find a way to get the systems working again. Inevitably not everybody will get out alive.Like most people who watched this in the cinema when it was new I was amazed by the special effects that brought long extinct creatures back to life; watching it again over twenty years later and they still look fantastic. If one didn't know that dinosaurs died out millions of years ago you could be excused for thinking you were watching real animals. While these were the films big selling point it would have been for nothing if we didn't also have a good story acted by a fine cast luckily we have both. The action isn't rushed; a significant amount of time is spent introducing all the main characters and explaining the characteristics of the various dinosaurs. This means that by the time everything goes wrong we care about the protagonists and know which characters to look forward to seeing die! There aren't a huge number of deaths and those there are aren't overly gruesome; the goriest moment is the brief sight of a severed arm. Despite its UK-PG rating it is surprisingly intense at times and has plenty of genuinely scary moments. The cast do an impressive job; Sam Neill and Laura Dern impress as the two leads and there are also fine performances from Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Jeff Goldblum and Bob Peck. Child characters are often annoying but Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards are pretty good as Tim and Lex; especially the latter who is a great screamer! Overall I'd defiantly recommend this to anybody wanting a genuinely exciting film that is suitable for most ages.","

"Dragoneyed363","4 May 2008","I first saw this back when I was little. If I remember correctly, it was also a big thing when it came out. I even had a backpack with a Velociraptor head sticking out of it for school. It was such an amazing achievement as a movie itself and the film is so wonderfully done that there's no doubt of why it has held up as long as it has and will remain the best dinosaur film ever created.The dinosaurs in this film look more realistic than any other prehistoric film, or even most movies today that try to pass off crappy CGI has reality. The acting was spectacular, and aside from how wonderful the creatures look and how vicious and exciting they were like no other dinosaur film had had them before, the plot and characters were solid and incredibly entertaining where you didn't think they would be so amusing. I will have to say again that one really huge reason why most people loved this movie was because of the special effects, but here again, isn't that an accomplishment in itself? Having your audience enjoy the film because of how realistic and fresh you are able to make it feel and look? I have never seen another movie with better effects than this one, ever. I am sure none of these horrible effects dinosaur movies that have been coming out lately could ever live up to the greatness of Jurassic Park.I am always going to love Jurassic Park for it's witty, unbelievable maneuvers and incredible screenplay though, as well. It was so properly thought out and executed, where most might have been expecting it to be nothing but high levels of adrenaline rushes with brainless action, which there was pulsating action, it just certainly wasn't as mindless. Many who dislike Jurassic Park really just have all the same reasons the average movie-goer would have for disliking a film, yet I haven't heard anyone fully describe and explain, well, what they truly thought were faults with this film, which gives me reason to believe that Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, for I, myself, have no faults with this film, except that I have seen other films that I enjoyed more. . . just a little more.","

"mark.waltz","30 April 2016","When man messes with the secrets of nature, they are going to live to regret it, that is if they live to see it. ""Think of it as a big cow"", scientist Sam Neill tells the kids he's trapped in the jungle when a herbivore visits the tree they are sleeping in a tree that the friendly dinosaur grabs a ton of leaves from to make a huge salad. But even big herbivores can crush a small human with their gigantic feet, and then there are the carnivores which come in all sizes, and even a small one can devour a full grown man in a matter of minutes, bones and all.If the shark of ""Jaws"" was frightening, the T-Rex and other species recreated at Richard Attenborough's mysterious island compound that he has set up as a possible amusement park. But there is no amusement when every species of meat eaters go after human prey.Impressive and cinematic, this was a huge blockbuster that came the same year as the film that won Steven Spielberg his very first Oscar, ""Schindler's List"", and it is a total contrast from that now classic drama about surviving the worst real event in modern history. ""Jurassic Park"" is about survival, too, and one that we pray never comes true with human involvement.Between Neill and Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Attenborough, this is pretty star-studded. The kids get grating at times, but the mixture of tense action and humor makes for a thrilling film. Once again, composer John Williams creates a classic score, adding to the many he's already done for a Spielberg film.For me, this is a reminder why science needs to keep its corrupt fingers off of the mysteries of nature. Dinosaurs are fascinating, but there is a reason why civilization has thrived while they became extinct. I look at this as just one possibility of how they lived, how they looked, and possibly how they interacted with whatever human beings looked like when these not always friendly giants roamed the earth.","

"estebangonzalez10","9 June 2015","""God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs.""Since we're only a couple of days away from the premiere of Jurassic World I wanted to share some thoughts on one of my all time favorite movie going experiences (perhaps my favorite). I was only 12 years old when Steven Spielberg released Jurassic Park in 1993 and from the second the movie started I was at the edge of my seat. From the breathtaking and groundbreaking visuals, to the outstanding cast, and the magnificent score everything about Jurassic Park made me fall in love with it. The dinosaurs had come to life before my very eyes, and Spielberg masterfully wrote a thrilling script that had me sweating for two full hours. I can never forget the thrills I felt during the T-rex scene and that final climax with the velociraptors in the museum's kitchen. I remember thinking there was no one cooler than Sam Neill's Alan Grant and I wanted to be Tim Murphy (played brilliantly by Joseph Mazzello). The rest of the cast was also amazing: Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Ariana Richards, Bob Peck, and Samuel L. Jackson. Many will consider Jaws as Steven Spielberg's most terrifying film, but for me it was Jurassic Park because I got to experience it on the big screen and it was my first memorable experience at a theater. I had seen many other films that had made an impact on me prior to this (Star Wars, The Goonies, Raiders of the Lost Arc, and E.T.) but none in a theater, so Jurassic Park holds that nostalgic value and it will forever remain one of my favorite films. It also became the first film I went to see again at a theater because I couldn't get enough of this world. There are so many quotable lines from this movie and many memorable scenes, and I realize it is going to be impossible for Jurassic World to live up to that standard but I am still highly anticipating it while I relive some of my childhood memories with Jurassic Park. It's a masterpiece.","

"Rob Paul","9 July 1999","It's hard to believe that it's 6 years since this film appeared at the cinemas. At the time it was a truly ground-breaking film, managing for the first time to portray dinosaurs in an extremely realistic manner, unlike those plasticine monsters that we were forced to watch in previous monster movies. Jurassic Park will also be remembered as the movie that finally made George Lucas sit up and realise that it was possible for him to make his prequels.In hindsight, while it is still an extremely well directed and tension filled movie, the script did seemed dumbed down in order to appeal to as many people as possible - but that's really irrelevant since this film is all about dinosaurs. One of Spielberg's brilliantly directed films, it even managed to make me forget Spielberg's previous disaster of a movie - do you recall HOOK?8/10.","

"Go_rated_R","16 August 2001","I don't know why I loved this movie so much.  Maybe it was the utter amazement when I first saw the Brachiosaurus eat from a tree.  Or maybe it was my adrenaline rushing when two 12 year old were attacked by velociraptors.  It might possibly be the chills that went down my spine when the T-Rex first made his terrifying roar.  Whatever it was, it made me write this review.Allan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie (Laura Dern) are two successful paleontologists who are asked by a rich man John Hammond to come at his park for a major tour.  They agree and are taken to an island where ""Jurassic Park"" logos are everywhere.  The two paleontologists have no idea what they are getting themselves into.  The first dinosaur to make an apearance is the Brachiosaurus, which both of them are extrememly amazed by its giant apearance, and so is the audience.  What the two of them don't know is that there are much more terrifying and carnivorous dinosaurs who are about to escape and run loose....Directed by the mighty Steven Speilberg, Jurassic Park relied on more character development than any other creature-feature.  Usually you get second-rate actors who can't act, getting terrified by monsters that don't really exist.  Jurassic Park was the opposite.  It changed the way we looked at the world, and it will forever.  Based on the novel by Micheal Crichton, Jurassic Park was an amazing movie.From beginning to end, Jurassic Park bedazzled us with dinosaurs.  Dinosaurs that are EXTINCT.  There are a lot of cool cameos and the stars give great performances.  The whole family should watch this movie.  Not for the glossy title, but because of the dinosaurs.  I remember being a kid when I first watched it, and I remember loving this movie so bad.  The climax was excellent, and I am not saying what happens, unlike the sequel to this film (Jurassic Park 3).  A climax-less bad film, that was.  But this....this was magic.  And yes, it was a masterpiece.The magic of this film is what brought me into dinosaurs, too.  I had a ""Jurassic Park"" marathon today and I watched this movie, and I can still feel the magic.  You will feel the magic too once you see it.  I just have absolutely nothing to say except that Steven Speilberg will put a spell on you.  Even if you don't like creature-features, this movie will entertain you.  Steven Speilberg will take you to places that no one else ever will. And the ""life will find a way"" speech is here, ready to make someone feel that creating dinosaurs that have been extinct for millions of years is a good thing.Absolutely needless to say, Jurassic Park was a golden diamond.10/10 (One of the greatest films ever made)","

"sophiebrooks-75145","28 September 2018","This movie is definitely one to remember. Despite being filmed in the 90s, Jurassic Park continues to be a classic to this day. 
Watching the movie now highlights the contrast between the effects then and the special effects available now. This, along with some acting that is a tad overdone, are the only real critiques I would give this film. 
The child actors were especially hilarious to me-the young boy, Timmy, has moments that really capture a reaction that a child in real life would have (""I threw up."" ""Well that's ok! That happens sometimes""-Allen-is one of my favorite quotes). 
Another extremely influential aspect of this film is the music that plays over certain intense scenes and the iconic theme music in the opening/closing. The music combined with the diegetic sound of the dinosaur stomping/approaching builds the suspense and creates an intense tension in the audience. 
As a classic worldwide, it's no wonder that this movie provided the basis for generations of movies to follow.","

"Jonathon_Natsis","1 April 2013","Perhaps more so than any other director in film history, Steven Spielberg has locked into that most desirable niche of movie-making: pleasing everyone at the same time. When his spectacular action-adventure Jurassic Park was first released in 1993, he left critics, film buffs, casual viewers, parents and children equally spellbound. Twenty years later, the film has been re-released in both 3D and IMAX, allowing a new generation to experience the magic, and old fans the chance to relive it again.Eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created the ultimate theme park on a secluded island, and he wants to offer a sneak preview to a select group of individuals (Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern). Of course, the prehistoric attractions don't much appreciate being detained for the amusement of others, and begin to cause havoc as soon as they take the opportunity to escape from their enclosures. An extremely imaginative plot adapted from Michael Crichton's novel of the same name, it sets the foundation for a rip-roaring battle for survival.For many viewers that first saw Jurassic Park as pre-teens, the greatest thrill will come from appreciating, to a greater degree, the way the film deftly builds suspense. Cleverly building up to the revelation of the 'meatasauruses' by stunning us with the visual treat of cuddly herbivores, when we do finally meet the imposing Tyrannosaurus, it is one of cinema's most exhilarating set pieces, only to be topped some time later by the thrilling cat-and-mouse game in the kitchen.It is a testament to the incredible skill of the animatronics and visual effects team that the film's most dated quality is the occasionally cheesy dialogue that burdens Lex and little brother Tim. The dinosaurs are clearly the main event, but the undercard of Jurassic Park spares no expense, with touches of class including Dr. Grant's personal evolution from a child apathist to a fully-fledged family man and a miasma of Shelley-esque criticisms of man's innate desire to play god while drunk on the illusion of total control.To call this the movie event of the year would be to make the grossest of understatements. Experiencing this glorious monument to total escapism on the world's biggest cinema screen is simply mandatory for anyone was has ever felt goosebumps in a theater. Bring your kids- they'll never forget it.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*","

"Criticman12","26 January 2011","Steven Spielberg is known for making great movies like, ""E.T."" and ""Schindler's List"". But on June 11 1993. He released my favorite movie, ""Jurassic Park"".What make's this movie great is the special effects. They really brought the Dinosaurs to life. It also had some nice suspenseful scene's. Also, the acting was good. Sam Neil does a nice job as Alan Grant and Richard Attenborough does a great job as John Hammond. Plus, the theme song was incredible. Sometimes when you listen to it, it feel's like you're going to cry.In the end, ""Jurassic Park"", is a great film and it is definitely worth watching.","

"bkoganbing","26 July 2016","As a kid I so well remember my younger brother and those dinosaur toys he had as a kid. We've seen dinosaurs in film before going back to the silent version of The Lost World. But they were never better shown than when Steven Spielberg made Jurassic Park out of Michael Crichton's novel. These put other screen dinosaurs to shame.Through some cloning billionaire Richard Attenborough has succeeded in recreating those long dead creatures of the past and now has a theme park, Jurassic Park. All the herbivores and the carnivores of the past are now alive. But when you come right down to it, Attenborough has just become another Dr. Frankenstein. Some things dead should stay dead.At least that's what scientists Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum try to tell him. And I have to admit Attenborough does have state of the art security. But he has a greedy employee in Wayne Knight who has made a secret deal with some rival tycoon. His greed brings the whole operation to disaster as dinosaurs start running amuck.The tyrannosaurus rexes and the raptors are what captured the imagination of the public when Jurassic Park was reached. Up to that time dinosaurs when they were on screen were slow moving behemoths. Spielberg's dinosaurs have some speed to them, far more like what they were in the Jurassic Age.I have to say I loved Wayne Knight's performance in Jurassic Park. He's such a loathsome creep, but also a real putz. The end he meets is truly just.Jurassic Park and its successors and imitators have brought about a renewed interest in paleontology. That's always healthy in any society, an interest in the sciences.My brother Daniel loved this film when it came out. As will you.","

"xiaoli7377","27 June 2022","Up there with""Jaws"", ""E. T."", and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" as one of the quintessential Spielberg popcorn flicks. Although I doubt there are people who've yet to watch it or at who are least familiar with its effect on pop culture, ""Jurassic Park"" is one of those movies that completely captivates and hits the nail on the head in every sequence. Unlike its myriad of sequels and spin-offs, what Spielberg does with the original is craft a Hitchcock-esque thriller that happens to have great special effects that hold up nearly thirty years later. Even sequences that would be mundane in most other action movies, like a Ford Explorer sliding down a tree and chasing the main characters, is exciting. I give a lot of this credit to the original score by John Williams.Excellent performances by Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum. Samuel L. Jackson also makes an early career performance here and it's awesome to see as well.It's an essential movie, one that all movie fans ought to watch at some point.","

"Moviedude90","12 June 2022","I don't write reviews on here often, just for the times when you HAVE to stop the movie to jump on IMDB and give the review while it's piping hot fresh in my mind...There are 2 movies that really seem like there were time-travelers from 50 years ahead that came back to the 90's to give two movies that are so beyond their times from an effects standpoint that they below in their own cinematic categories all together: Jurassic Park and the Matrix, the former for animatronics mastery, and the latter for its 360 camera and CGI integration. In my opinion, these 2 films are major turning points in cinema.Just try and look at other movies in 1993 and 1999 for their graphics, for either the use of animatronics or CGI. Think of this, The Lion King came out a year AFTER Jurassic Park and was billed as cutting edge because they used computers throughout the animation. Seriously, name ONE movie in the last 28 years that came even close to looking and feeling as realistic as Jurassic Park? Name just one...I'll wait...Even compare all the Godzilla remakes they spend crazy money on and tell me that CGI looks more realistic than Jurassic Park animatronics, and I'll call you a liar. The same appliesThe second part of this conversation I'll leave for a Matrix review board, this is a tribute to animatronics, Jurassic Park, and Spielberg in the early 90's 🍻Ok, now back to the second half of the show! 🍿","

"BA_Harrison","15 November 2008","I was raised on a diet of dinosaur and monster films, and so when Steven Spielberg gave us Jurassic Park in 1993 promising unbelievably lifelike prehistoric reptiles, I was at the head of the queue (metaphorically speaking of course, since I pre-booked my tickets!!). Needless to say, Steve's amazing big screen version of the Michael Crichton bestseller not only delivered on the promises, making the film a deservedly huge box-office success, but it also redefined special effects for years to come.Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum play three scientists who are invited to a multi-million dollar theme park featuring cloned dinosaurs, which the owner (good old Dickie Attenborough) hopes the trio of boffins will endorse. However, when one disloyal employee sabotages the park's computer system in order to try and steal valuable embryos for a competitor, the guests get to see the exhibits extremely close-up, and must fight for survival against the mighty T-Rex and a pack of intelligent and voracious Velociraptors.The film's plot is a somewhat stripped-down version of the book, and the narrative suffers occasionally for the lack of detail, but with Spielberg at the helm, the result is still a juggernaut of an action film that provides enough thrills, spills and adventure to make it unmissable for fans of creature features. The director manages to pull off some spectacular shots that are amongst the most memorable of his career (such as the simple yet iconic 'water-ripples' as the T-Rex approaches), and with the industry's top FX wizards at his disposal (including ace animatronics expert Stan Winston), he has made a film that still looks amazing a decade and a half later.The best of the trilogy (although part IV is currently in the pipeline, so we shall have to wait and see what happens with that one), Jurassic Park is an excellent piece of cinematic escapism, and way better than anything Spielberg has given us in recent years (I'm still reeling from the latest Indy film and the debacle that was War of the Worlds).","

"SimonJack","14 June 2022","""Jurassic Park"" clearly deserved all the awards it received for special effects - visual, sound and editing. The entire production team contributed to one of the best sci-fi films ever made. And, without a doubt, it's the best monster sci-fi film ever made well into the 21st century. I can't think of another creature feature that seemed so real. While CGI was obviously very important in making this picture, the realism has to be attributed as much to the fantastic models of the dinosaurs created for the film - especially the main villain, T-Rex.This film took the development and use of animatronics to a new level. These are robotic types of models able that can be moved, for sequences of shots that make them seem to come to life. The effect, with actual creations is much more realistic than CGI. People can see videos of the creation and making of T-Rex online. People can see videos of the creation and making of the big guy online.The basis of the film, and a succession of sequels and all sorts of spinoffs, of course is the 1990 novel of the same title by Michael Crichton. Crichton (1942-2008) was a Harvard Medical school graduate and M. D. But he never practiced medicine in favor of a flourishing, driven writing career. He was the master storyteller of sci-fi thrillers, especially plots around medicine and the physical sciences. Of his 26 novels, 13 have been made into films. He also wrote several original screenplays, and directed and produced films. His first smash film success was ""The Andromeda Strain"" of 1971. Jurassic Park is by far the most successful book and film, but his books by 2020 had sold more than 200 million copies.Crichton and Stephen Spielberg became friends while working on this and other films. While having great directing talent across many genres, Spielberg has had a particular flair for sci-fi films. The Jurassic Park series are the most prominent, but others of his productions include ""Firelight"" of 1964, ""E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" of 1982, ""Twilight Zone, The Movie"" of 1983, ""Gremlins"" of 1984, ""Back to the Future"" of 1985, ""Innerspace"" of 1987, ""batteries not included"" of 1987, and sequels of some of these and more.All of the aspects of this film are excellent. And all of the cast are superb. The plot is simple and while many, many more have reviewed and commented on this film, I decided this late just to give the recognition to the author and director, both of whom have a repertoire of films that will last and be enjoyed far into the future. And as for seeing this film, anyone who has not yet seen it on a theater screen should watch for any such opportunity in the future. This is the type of film that misses the grand scale of the subject on TV screens, even the large flat wall screens. Dinosaurs, especially in ""Jurassic Park,"" and its sequels, should be seen on the big screen for maximum enjoyment.","

If you haven't seen this movie yet, get out from your cave and see it right away. I have seen this movie umpteen times and it still shocks and suprises me. If you have a DVD player I suggest that you buy the Jurassic Park 2 pack as soon as possible. The movie sounds and looks great, and the extras are cool too. So to summarize go see this.

"stephie-12","26 February 2004","This was obviously the most sophisticated portrayal of dinosaurs at the time, and it doesn't age a bit.  Sam Neill plays Dr Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is persuaded to check out Richard Attenborough's new theme park, only to find that he has managed to clone dinosaurs.  There is plenty of action, and the dinos look so real as to be positively scary!  Sam Neill puts in his usual incredibly brilliant performance, and you can really believe he is acting with the creatures!  Jeff Goldblum as usual seems to play himself, as Professor Ian Malcolm, an expert in chaos theory who is convinced the park is a bad idea.  The cast are amazing, the effects are amazing, this whole movie is amazing.  It doesn't get any better than this!","

"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","8 February 2019","Jurassic Park (1993) is one of the best classic science fiction action adventure movie one of my personal number 1 favorite adventure Dinosaurs films of all time. It is Steven Spielberg's ultimate thrill ride. It has great visual effects, breathtaking story, it has heart and soul it defines my childhood. I grew up with the film I used to had a t-shirt with Jurassic Park. I love the film to death it is the best one in the franchise it is my number 1 favorite film In the franchise we can say it is the best animal family movie for everyone including kids.It has wonderful score from John Williams, great cast it has Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards.The film is based on a novel from Michael Crichton the book come out 1990 the movie come out 1993 and Michael Crichton helped writing a script for the film. It was brilliant direction from Steven Spielberg about scientists tampering with nature, the film is also mixed with horror in which velociraptor try's to eat Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) who finds a Ray Arnold's arm (Samuel L. Jackson). The effects are top notch, the CGI for 1993 is still good I love the design for T-Rex and the velociraptor fighting on the end. I love Brachiosaurus in this movie I love those dinosaurs so much.The story is original a group of scientist cloned dinosaurs they about to open a amusement park for people lead by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who invites on a island of Isla Nublar, four people paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and a lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to gave him their opinions. All three disagree with John Hammond that tempered with nature is wrong and only a lawyer agrees with John because he thinks the park will make a fortune. One of the employees Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) is planning to steal dinosaur eggs and during a preview tour, he causes a security power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok. Dr. Grant stays with the kids Tim (Joseph Mazzello) and Lex (Ariana Richards) alone in the park and he has to return to resort complex, meanwhile John Hammond, Dr. Ellie Sattler, Ian Malcolm, Ray Arnold and Robert Muldon (Bob Peck) trying to get the power back.I love Dr. Alan Grant I love the character he was a great hero, great adventurer great paleontologist and great researcher. I love Sam Neill his character was writen on his skin. I love the kids Tim and Lex Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards they were great kids who were Hammond's grandchildren I love them. The most heart in the film was Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) because she cared about the animals she was a great human been she wanted to help a sick triceratops which I love the character so much. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) I really miss the actor I love his character I love what he try to do I love him to dead it is a shame he is no longer with us. I like Dr. Ian Malcolm in this movie he wasn't annoying in this movie Jeff Goldblum was likable and decent.My favorite scenes in the movie are: The T-Rex chases the jeep down the road with Dr. Sattler, Ian Malcolm and Robert Muldon in an exciting car chase of an action sequence. I love in which Dr. Grant and kids are climbing over the fences and the fences are electricity high voltage the fence electrifies Tim and he fly's down off the fence great breathtaking scene ever. I love that scene. I love the action sequence in which Lex and Tim are cornered by a pair of velociraptors inside the main kitchen and fight for their survival. Another favorite scene of mine is when Ellie discovers Ray's severed arm in the maintenance shed and she sees the raptor that eat Ray try's to eat her. I really miss this movies and I miss my childhood. My best friend from my childhood was a huge fan of this film he collected comic books, action figures and he borrowed me his VHS tape of this film because I never seen the film before and I loved it.I love this film to death it has everything atmosphere, good wonderful effects, good scares, awesome thrills, breathtaking suspense on your sit, wonderful directing, great acting from everyone everything that makes the best movie in the adventure animal franchise. This is the best one in the franchise and my number 1 favorite dinosaurs film.","

"Sleepin_Dragon","28 January 2023","Dinosaur DNA is discovered, and geneticists manage to bring the extinct species back to life,at Jurassic Park, however the peace and tranquility is broken when the power fails.Jurassic Park is one of those films I grew up with, and have loved since the day I first saw it. I would imagine this is one of those films you'll remember seeing for the first time, I think I went about three times, then subsequently picked up the DVD, then the blu ray, it's a film I watch pretty frequently.It has never lost its magic, it's an imaginative, action packed blockbuster, it has never lost any of its shine, even some of the atrocious follow ups have never managed to tarnish it.It spends the first hour building up, introducing the characters, the beasts, then it kicks into top gear, it really is edge of the seat viewing.The action sequences are still incredible, and will still entertain audiences young and old. It isn't just all about the special effects, which are of course excellent, it is incredibly well acted, Neill, Durn and Goldblum are all on point, especially when you imagine how much green screen acting they'd have done. Dickie Attenborough, I could watch him in anything.Jurassic Park was, and always will be, a wonderful, action packed family blockbuster.10/10.","

"Al_The_Strange","14 June 2015","Genetics can unlock the secrets of creating and growing biological life; we've already used these secrets to clone a sheep, to alter our crops, and it may allow us to repopulate endangered species. In his novel, Michael Crichton explored the unique and harrowing possibility that genetics could bring the dinosaurs back. When entrepreneurs try to turn the miracle of dinosaur cloning into a theme park attraction, chaos theory kicks in, proving that nature can't be tamed that easily.Stephen Spielberg's adaptation of Crichton's novel takes the original premise, complete with its cautionary warnings, and delivers it as a fast-moving adventure film full of color, wit, and thrills. There are moments where the film emphasizes the whimsy and wonder of creation, but when the deadliest of predators are unleashed, there are a fair amount of harrowing, suspenseful chases that follow. One of the most chilling scenes shows the dreaded Tyrannosaurus Rex breaking loose from its paddock and laying waste to a pair of jeeps, threatening to crush and eat everybody trapped inside. Velociraptors rush through the jungles and buildings, threatening to devour human prey. What starts off as a wondrous ""what if"" scenario eventually devolves into a struggle for survival and escape; occasional bursts of comedy keeps the film lightweight, but with groundbreaking special effects, carefully-staged action, and characters worth caring about, the film offers a grand spectacle and a perfectly-entertaining blockbuster experience.Much of the story is altered from the original book, but it's hardly an issue. On its own merits, the film tells the story it wants to and it does it well. It flips a few of the characters around so that there's a family dynamic at work. Most of the characters are likable, and the film sets them up so that we can understand and care for them when they're in danger. Some of them make very bad decisions, but even the dumbest characters are endearing, because the film shows them as being very human and prone to mistakes; these faults ultimately contribute to the plot's progression. The plot unfolds spectacularly, continuously building in tension and action. Throughout the picture, the characters speculate and dig up fascinating themes about playing God with genetics; the film's events prove that all human attempts to control nature and force a structure will never work, and life will always find a way to break free and thrive on its own. These themes carry both wonder and terror, and the film emphasizes both aspects aptly.This film is made with really good photography. Editing can be a little weak at times, but it is often punchy and good. Acting is pretty over-the-top, but it produces expressions and emotions that fit in perfectly with the film's tone. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are perfectly likable in their roles. Jeff Goldblum steals the show repeatedly with his character's wit and wisdom. Richard Attenborough has a great presence and personality as John Hammond. The kid characters put their best into it, and they do have some endearing moments that gives the film a more emotional punch. Bob Peck is cool, Martin Ferraro is a dude we love to hate, Wayne Knight is an even bigger dude we love to hate, Samuel L Jackson keeps it real, and everybody else is decent. This script is full of great lines, but some dialogue can be rather random, and it's all really low-key. Despite one or two shortcuts, this production uses good-looking sets, props, costumes, and creature effects. Special effects were fantastic for its time, and most of them still hold up to this day. John Williams' music score is catchy and emotional.Jurassic Park is easily one of the best blockbusters, not only because of all its visual effects and thrills, but also because it has heart, and it has themes worth thinking about. It's a must-see.4.5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Good)","

"bluemoonrising26","22 November 2011","Simply one of the greatest films of all time. How on Earth it is only rated as 7.9/10 I'll never know.It has a great plot, structured of course around Michael Crichton's equally brilliant novel, and the graphics are absolutely superb. Jurassic Park, along with the sequel 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', had Dinosaurs that were actually convincing. Of course, there was some artistic license involved - certain behaviours of the animals were exaggerated or entirely fabricated - but that in no way detracts from the film. They are certainly better than those in the comparably average third instalment in the franchise, 'Jurassic Park III'. Living in the 21st century (or 20th, as it were) this film gave us a recreation of these creatures that was genuinely believable.For all their fancy graphics and obscene budgets, films such as 'Avatar' will never compare to the likes of Jurassic Park.","

A 10/10 for me. I love this movie. So many memories. If Superman made me believe a man could fly, Jurassic Park made me believe dinosaurs can be brought back to life and run amok. There are some movies its hard to pick faults with. This is one such movie. All the cast are great Sam Niel is perfect as your typical Spielberg hero, the ordinary man who must do something extraordinary, Jeff Goldblum hits the right notes not delving into comedy relief, despite having the movies funniest lines, Laura Dern is an actress I really rate, she never puts a foot wrong in a movie. Though I have to admit, I never noticed the obvious ass shot until today!! Where have I been looking for 25 years?? And both kids (Arianna Richards and Joseph Mazello) are just the right amount of movie kid cute/curious/scared/resilient!! A hard balance to get right!! The special effects and CGI are almost faultless, with only one exception (the girl falling from the air vent) being obvious!! But that is seriously nitpicking!!And John Williams score!! WOW!! I love it.Jurassic Park scooped 3 Oscars and grossed $357 million at the domestic box office, to end 1993 as the highest grossing movie I'm of the year. Spielberg's 4th highest grossing movie of the year (Jaws, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, E.T)Like with Jaws and Raiders Of The Lost Ark, I could watch Jurassic Park again tomorrow.","

"rahmannoodles22","19 December 2013","Look up the word ""awe"" in the dictionary... ya know what you'll find? Jurassic Park. And now in 3D! Usually, I don't really like post- converted 3D in movies, but this one won me over. Ever since I was a little kid, I've always loved Jurassic Park (I think we all did) and I'd always heard that it was one of the best movie theater experiences ever. Unfortunately, I wasn't born when this originally came out so I never got the chance to experience that... until now! And damn, were they right when they said it was an awesome movie theater experience because it sure as hell is. It's so fun, engrossing, and thrilling to watch it on the big screen, with all the sound surrounding you (the sound in Jurassic Park has got to be some of the best sound in a movie ever). Jurassic Park is also one of the most monumental movies of all time. It defined CGI. The CGI and special effects in this movie still holdup today and are even better than most movies today.The story of Jurassic Park is that a really rich guy has cloned dinosaurs to make an amusement park full of living dinosaurs (you would do that if you could too). Because they are these live dinosaurs in the park, his investors say that he needs approval from experts, so he recruits Dr. Alan Grant (a paleontologist who is more or less the protagonist of the movie), Dr. Elli Sattler (a paleobotanist), and Dr. Ian Malcom (a mathematician who's character is pretty much the show stealer). Through a number of circumstances, the dinosaurs get loose and all hell breaks loose. Now, we have our movie being one of the most awe- inspiring movies ever; as well as being one of the most suspenseful movies ever. When the characters first enter Jurassic Park, you see the many dinosaurs in the distance and the theme (one of the greatest movie themes of all time) is playing in the background. Your jaw just drops. And the dinosaurs look awesome. Sometimes they're CGI, sometimes they're animatronic. Sometimes they're amazing... oh wait, that's all the time. One of my favourite scenes is when the T-Rex is attacking the car and a flashlight shines in its eye and the eye dilates. That just shows how detailed and alive these dinos are.But the dinosaurs don't wreak havoc until about halfway, or even 3/4, through the film. Even yet, the movie does a brilliant job of immersing you into it, bringing you onto this island, and getting you to care for the characters. The dialogue and acting are so good that you feel as though you're there with the characters (it drags sometimes but it's easy to get past that). And when they're in peril, you feel as though you're in danger too. I just can't stress how substantial the suspense in Jurassic Park is. The 3D does add to that, too. The 3D in this movie is probably the best post-converted 3D I've ever seen and it works really well.Jurassic Park is really a movie that everyone should experience (notice how I didn't say ""watch""). If you get the chance, see it in theaters and have your mind absolutely blown. The movie is full of awe and imagination; it sometimes makes me feel like a little kid again. The characters are likable; their dialogue is believable and sometimes humorous. The dinosaurs are awesome. The suspense is intense as hell. The soundtrack is perfect. It's a classic...","

"STACorpus","4 October 2005","Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film. Great casting, decent acting, great special effects, beautiful and perfect score by John Williams, incredible directing. I believe this movie has to be one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Although not entirely true to the book, (though someone should never say a movie is not good because it is not exactly like the book because that really doesn't matter) Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark in special effects and a standard for thriller films to be compared to. It also contains some scenes that are instant classics, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the scene where the T-Rex chases the jeep. I will keep this movie in my list of favorites and classics till the day i die.","

"FlashCallahan","6 February 2011","On a remote island, a wealthy entrepreneur secretly creates a theme park featuring living dinosaurs drawn from prehistoric DNA. Before opening the attraction to the public, he invites a top paleontologist, a paleobotanist, a mathematician/theorist, and his two eager grandchildren to experience the park, and help calm anxious investors. However, their park visit is anything but tranquil as the park's security system breaks down, the prehistoric creatures break out......There is no surprise that this film was the box office king for four years, this is truly one of the last original big summer movies to be released. And it's success was thanks to the lack of the world wide web being virtually non existent at the time.All we had were the trailers and that iconic poster to whet our appetite, and the rest is history.This is the perfect family film, it's not too dark, but not too child orientated, and it has that obvious Spielberg magic to every character and the narration.The film does start off quite slowly, but the first scene gives us a hint of what is to come. And when the glass of water starts to vibrate, the film never lets up until we see the 'directed by Steven Spielberg' credit.The effects today are still awe-inspiring, and the tension is still phenomenal today. Compared to todays summer movies, give or take a couple, they don't hold the heart or emotion or the thrills that this film does.The cast are great, and Peck is eerily like a raptor.For sheer spectacle, the initial T-Rex scene and the kitchen scene are some of the best filmed scenes in a blockbuster.","

"ironhorse_iv","6 April 2013","I don't really like paying for movie tickets just to watch old movies converted into 3D. I can watch the 2D version at home, with no cost. Still, Jurassic Park is one of those movies. No matter, if you watch it in 3D or 2D, your jaw will dropped seeing the realistic lifelike dinosaurs on screen. I had watch this movie over and over again over the years, and it always is a blast to watch. In my opinion, it's one of the best movies of the 1990's. Jurassic Park is the story of a theme park on a tropical island near Costa Rica, populated with cloned dinosaurs that turn amok, and those left on the island, must find a way to escape. Jurassic Park shows the potential danger of technology. Owner John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) spared no expense making this park, but in an attempt to increase efficiency and save money, wants Jurassic Park to be able to operate with a minimal number of staff run by weasel Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) and Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson). Therefore, he has the park designed to be operated almost entirely by a huge computer system that automates virtually all of the park's systems and functions. What he doesn't know is that Dennis Nedry, has been paid off by one of InGen's corporate rivals to steal dinosaur embryos. During the theft, Nedry deactivates the park's security system to allow him access to the embryo storage room. Jurassic Park was written by Michael Crichton in 1990, the beginning of the information age, where everything was getting computerizing, but few knew the dangers of it. People are still suffering from computer theft even today. Another danger of technology is how men shouldn't play God by cloning extinct animals. The movie mirrors the lesson teach in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Still the science in the film might be far-fetch. The idea of bringing dinosaurs to life after 65 million years is unlikely even with future technology. Soft tissues that contain DNA are nearly impossible to preserve and the chances of extracting enough DNA of a single dinosaur to produce one are slim. Still, it's interesting. If it does happen, you know that chaos will come close in hand. This serves as an example, where technology fails to keep us save, and prove disastrous. Still the movie fails to explain why Hammond didn't use all the staff that he has. They were paid to be there, so when the hurricane comes to the island. Surprising the film footage of the storm was Hurricane Iniki that hit Hawaii where they were filming. So that was really a hurricane that being shown there. Anyways it would make sense to have the staff there to make sure the island is secure, but he send them off the island for something that was a merely a small storm, keeping only two computer guys and a game hunter? What? The movie would be a little bit more interesting if only we, the audience got to see the whole staff in danger as well, like Michael Crichton earlier novel, 'Westworld' that has a similar plot. Instead we only see a small group of dinosaur experts try to escape the island rather than a whole island in chaos. This small group is leaded by paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). Harrison Ford was first ask, but he turned down the role of Dr. Alan Grant as people might mistake the character for Indiana Jones. In my opinion, Sam Neill was perfect for the role. They are joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim Murphy (Joseph Mazzello). The kids are bit annoying as they do idiotic stuff or have stupid dialogue. Most of the movie, I really wanted them to get eaten by a dinosaur. It make sense for all those characters to be in the island, except Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a mathematician that the lawyer brought in. While Jeff Goldblum is given some of the best lines in the film; the reason why his character is there is still a question to me. He doesn't know anything about dinosaurs. Still, I do like his flirting with Chaos Theory. The movie differs from the book in a bit. I'm glad Steven Spielberg took out the Hupia theme from the story. It wasn't needed. Different characters end up dying, while other characters that supposedly died in the book, live in the film version. Surprising the whole character of Tina was written out of the film. The film has amazing visual and special effects by the use of animatronics. The film is noted as one of the first movies to use CGI. Director Steven Spielberg was worried that computer graphics might look like 8 bit type cartoon quality but upon seeing ILM's demo animation of dinosaurs. He decided to shoot nearly all the dinosaur scenes using this method. In my opinion, the stop motion they did film wasn't too bad as well. The early CGI, this film use is surprising is better than a lot of modern day CGI that low budget companies use. Jurassic Park's soundtrack compost by John Williams is truly anthem of our childhood. The music is spectacular. Not a lot of people know this, but while Steven Spielberg work on Schindler's List, he placed post-production in the hands of George Lucas. In many ways, you can see Luca's influence in the film. It was while supervising post-production on this film that George Lucas decided that technology was good enough to begin work on the Star Wars prequels. The movie is a must- see movie, not only if you love dinosaurs, but also if you love Sci-Fiction. Give it a try if you haven't saw it already. An adventure 65 million years in the making is waiting for you.","

"Cinema-reviewer321","7 June 2022","Jurassic Park (1993) is a classic that is worth watching and re-watching. If you have not seen Jurassic Park (1993) I suggest checking it out.Sam Neill as Alan Grant and Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler both do a wonderful job as 2 archeologists visiting Jurassic Park and seeing real Dinosaurs for the first time.The effects and practical effects of the dinosaurs looked great in the year of 1993, and they still hold up today. How the dinosaurs interact with the human characters and vehicles was cool, because of how much time and effort they put into making it look real.The musical score by John Williams is great and iconic. I highly recommend watching Jurassic Park (1993) it is a must watch if you love Steven Spielberg.","

"lee_eisenberg","29 December 2005","Everyone knows what happens in ""Jurassic Park"", so I'll just talk about a few aspects. I think that it's fitting that the movie was released in 1993. With baby boomer Bill Clinton now in the White House, it was clearly a new era, and this movie looked like it was representing a new era - think of it as being 1961, with young John Kennedy as the new president (which it would have been for my parents)*. The fact that Steven Spielberg also released ""Schindler's List"" that year and won two Oscars for it backs up this aspect.Unfortunately, ""The Lost World"" was beyond pathetic. It was just a repeat of the first one and was totally predictable. So avoid that one and stick with this one. I never saw ""Jurassic Park III"". While in Maui during spring break, 2003, I went on a helicopter ride and we flew over the area where parts of ""Jurassic Park"" were filmed.*As it was, Rob and Laura Petrie on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" were loosely based on the Kennedys. I don't know of any characters based on the Clintons.","

"OlieRendch","26 August 2013","Jurassic Park. An island full of dinosaurs who terrorise people; a simple premise but extremely well done. From beginning to end this film is just an enjoyable watch. Back in 1993 when it was released these never-before-seen effects had to have wowed audiences, and even now it still holds up with the anamatronics, CGI combo, it is really good; I've seen worst stuff in other movies and TV series. The characters I thought were pretty well done and acted, you really didn't want certain things happen to certain people and I really like Sam Neil as Alan Grant. Now, I was really exited to watch my favourite film on the big screen and especially in 3D, I watched it in IMAX as well, something I had never done before, and boy did it deliver. The 3D in this movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, better than Man of Steel and Iron Man 3 by far. Jurassic Park in the third dimension brought a whole new life too it, just some of the scenes with the trees, and leaves and then an awesome scene in the kitchen was good in 3D. So yes, I think Jurassic Park will continue being my favoured film for a long time to come.","

"Pythonman","8 June 2005","What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? Who knows. We all know that this has some of the greatest special effects, even today. Also, if there's anything that can match the awesome T-Rex, it's the movie's musical score. I swear, listen to it more than once, and you're bound to see the movie yet again, if for that sole reason. It's that powerful. Oh sure, acting isn't this movie's strong suit, but who looks for acting in a Dinosaur thriller? Who?!Anyway, I think I've made my point. Jurassic Park: One of America's greatest classics. Steven Spielberg created magic with this movie. If you haven't seen it once, you haven't seen it at all.","

"g-bodyl","24 October 2008","Jurassic Park is one of Spielberg's best movies. i was so awed by this movie when I first saw it. Everything is just about amazing regarding this film. The story is about a dinosaur park off the coast of Costa Rica. There were rumors that the park was in serious trouble, so the owner John Hammond decides to get a dinosaur expert, paleobotanist, a scientist, a lawyer, and his grandchildren to endorse the park. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs are free from their domains after the power went out. Now everybody must have their survival instincts in hand. The acting is very good. I Liked Sam Neill as Alan Grant. The special effects were amazing. The dinosaurs are pretty darn perfect. The sound effects are excellent as well. I really loved the music in this film. John Williams did such a fantastic job with this score and themes. Overall, this is must-see movie. I rate this movie 10/10.","

"brando647","2 May 2008","This film is easily one of my favorite movies. I saw this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1993; I was only 9-years-old and, though some scenes scared the crap out of me, it blew me away. I was amazed at how, for the first time in a movie, I felt like I was watching REAL dinosaurs. For those who haven't seen this movie (there are people like that?), it centers on a billionaire's attempt to create a new amusement park on an isolated island creating bio-engineered dinosaurs; when a group of specialists are brought in to examine the park, things go terribly wrong.I absolutely loved the story of this film; I loved it so much I had my parents buy me Michael Crichton's novel and I read it 3 times through the course of my fifth grade year. It was then that I fell in love with the work of Crichton and found myself reading the rest of his work. While, yes, the movie did divert pretty heavily from the book, I still felt it was a great adaptation. It's Spielberg's version of Crichton's story, so I don't mind the mass differences. The movie is much more family-friendly than Crichton's novel and I would love to see a another version eventually, a darker version that sticks closer to Crichton's novel. Unlike most instances when I can say ""The book was better"" or ""The movie was better"", I don't feel the need in this case because they were both fantastic.The cast did a terrific job. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough...all were great in their roles. Though my favorite performance came from Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, the arrogant chaos theoretician. I've been a fan of Goldblum for a while and I thought he was the perfect choice for the role in this movie. Of course, I have to rave a bit about the film's special effects. As I mentioned before, this film contains probably the most realistic dinosaurs seen in cinema. A seamless combination of practical animatronics and CGI were used to bring the dinosaurs to life. By now, the effects seem a little dated but they continue to stand strong even now, 15 years later.This movie is one of those films that every must see. It grossed $350 million in the US alone. The film marked yet another milestone in special effects in cinema. And most importantly, it's just entertaining.","

"ma-cortes","24 May 2012","First chapter from trilogy that gives exciting , sweeping fun and entertainment provided by giant animals made by means of incredible combination of computer generator -ILM, Industrial Light Magic- and Animatronics models . This original ideal is based on Michael Crichton's novel and writing credits by David Koepp . The picture starts on Isla Nublar, a small island 120 miles off the coast of Costa Rica , a group of construction workers and animal handlers offload a large container, the creature within unseen. During the process, the animal tries to escape, an act which leads to a mass panic , and the death of one of the workers . The island in property the billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) ; as Jurassic Park's owner brings to various paleontologists (Sam Neill , Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum) to the island of Costa Rica hoping to convince them for an incredible adventure and where Dinos were allowed mix freely and to breed . There are living dinosaurs and various prehistoric creatures genetically engineered by means of DNA cloned extracted from Jurassic animals found in mosquitoes preserved into amber from cretaceous period . During a preview tour , Nedry (Wayne Knight) disables the security system so that he can make his escape with some stolen embryos , this enables all the dinosaurs to escape their enclosures . Then , the theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok against the paleontologists and the curator's grandsons (Joseph Mazzelo , Ariana Richards) .This is an enjoyable first entry , plenty of spine-tingler thrills , chills , emotion and lots of fun . The Dinosaurs are the real protagonists , they're terrifyingly awesome and almost completely convincing. Simple dialog and plain tale , but the story is very exciting and inventive . In the film appears numerous predator animals and colossal carnivores as Tyrannosaurus Rex , Velociraptors, Behemoths , Spinosaurious , Stegosauruses although most of creatures are large herbivores harmless and feed on vegetables as large dinosaurs , triceratops and Brachiosaurius accompanied by a herd of Parasaurolophus . Humans try desperately to escape of dinosaurs and they are chased through leafy jungle by fanged giant animals , specially by the Tyrannosaurus and of course by attack of the Velociraptors . In fact the prehistoric animals are truly the film stars , they are terrifyingly awful and create abundant and quite potent screams and scares . There're some stirring and exciting scenes dealing a van dangling over a cliff and Tyrannosaurius pushing while the starring are seized in a cord where the actors give vigorous physical performances . The biggest interpretations are by Sam Neill as a nice , resourceful paleontologist , Jeff Goldblum as a likable mathematician and Wayne Knight as greedy man with mean purports . Magnificent especial effects totally convincing are for combination of models in charge of Stan Winston Studio and computer animation from Phil Tippet , Dennis Muren along with Industrial , Light and Magic of George Lucas . As always spectacular music by John Williams and excellent cinematography by Dean Cundey , both of whom are Spielberg's habituals . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Steven Spielberg , plus including his typical touches . Rating : Above average , well worth watching . It's followed by ¨Lost world¨ directed again by Spielberg and Jurassik Park III by Joe Johnston . The film will appeal to teenagers and and growns-up , but no for small kids by violent, realistic and gory attacks by monsters animals.","

"snoozejonc","24 September 2020","A group of scientists are invited to an island to see the results of some ground-breaking genetic engineering.I saw this in the cinema several times on its release and have to say it blew my mind at the time. Everything from Michael Crichton's initial concept to the magical effects that brought it to life all seemed like a yet another cinematic milestone from Spielberg in the same year that he made Schindler's List.The effects probably seem standard when you compare to films made in the twenty-first century. Bringing dinosaurs to life with the same kind of epic excitement and horror as witnessed in Jaws was a big deal in 1993. Unlike in Jaws, thanks to Industrial Light And Magic, Spielberg shows us the principle creatures in all their glory.The spectacle is presented in fairly measured way, as I was equally thrilled by the visuals that use no special effects. Simple sequences such as an arm being pulled through someone else's grasp, a raptor shadow, a shaky spoon of jelly and the famous tremor in the puddle are all example of cinematic moments that tell me exactly what's happening and stick in my memory.Most characters play second fiddle to the excitement and visual spectacle. Jeff Goldblum's mathematician Ian Malcolm is by far the most memorable with all the best lines of the script. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are solid as the two main characters, while Wayne Knight, Samual L Jackson, Martin Ferrero and Bob Peck give strong support. Richard Attenborough is perfectly cast as John Hammond. Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards fill the roles of the obligatory child characters well, but for me the movie didn't need them.Alongside the dinosaurs whenever I think of Jurassic Park, I think of yet another beautifully written piece of music from genius composer John Williams. Again Spielberg has Williams to thank for elevating one of his movies to the level of modern day classic.I recently watched it with my four year old daughter and (a few scares aside) she sat through it all with great interest. When a movie has the power to do this you know it is well made.","

"master of the obvious","21 June 1999","What can I say? Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated movies ever. Yes, I did say underrated. True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg's magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I've seen with great acting by children. Spielberg's camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs' ""interaction"" with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed. And, best of all, like star wars you can analyze the movie all you want or just sit back and enjoy the ride.","

"MrLunatic","6 July 2018","''Life, uh... finds a way.''One of the best & most iconic movie quotes of all times.I don't know what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said. Really...Considering this movie was made in 1993, visual effects are of incredible quality, as you see it better on blu-ray. When it comes to story, it's completely original, nearly flawless. I can't say too much about the acting. I believe acting is not the movie's strongest point. But still, it was enough for that movie. You don't need to be like Marlon Brando in a sci-fi movie about dinosaurs and has great visual & sound effects. The movie is very fun to watch.I also sensed a small message like, ''don't mess with nature''.Best thing about the movie (for me) was the score. Especially the ''Welcome to Jurassic Park'' scene. Of course we're talking about John Williams, the guy who wrote the theme for Star Wars, so that's not a surprise.Highly recommend it.9/10","

"Chrysanthepop","6 August 2008","I've always admired Steven Spielberg for his attempts to make different movies. Even though not all of them are exceptional, I've always liked watching them and 'Schindler's List', 'Jurassic Park', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'The Terminal'...just to name a few, rank among my favourites. 'Jurassic Park' is an exciting action adventure. I don't even remember how many times I've seen it but I do recall that I've enjoyed it every single time.The special effects are stunning. The dinosaurs look eerily real. Next to being detailed and well tones, the movement looks very realistic (as in most films one can see the go-motion which Spielberg had cleverly avoided). I wonder why filmmakers today don't use this kind of special effects instead of going entirely CGI. Thanks to the cinematography, the whole park is spectacular to watch and it has just as much an important role as the creatures. The background score and brilliant sound effects manage to create that chilling mood.Another thing that makes 'Jurassic Park' so exciting to watch is the suspense element which is very well built. The viewers wonder who will die next, which dinosaurs will show up, what's the fate of the main characters etc. The opening sequence already gives us the feel that it will be quite a bloodfeast. But, the events that follow thereafter are more 'laidback'. Spielberg starts the story by introducing the park and once the viewer knows all there is to know about the park, the action begins. Though some seem to find the plausibility of the theory about dinosaurs being revived and set to roam the world, problematic, I'd say enjoy it for what it is. It's not supposed to be a philosophical movie with deep meaning (but if someone sees it that way and appreciates it who am I to complain).The cast do a great job. Sam Neill and Laura Derns do a cool job of taking over roles that were offered to the likes of Harrison Ford, William Hurt, Robin Wright Penn, Juliette Binoche and Sridevi. Richard Attenborough always has a pleasant presence even though his character is initially somewhat of a jerk. Jeff Goldblum's charismatic Ian provides some comic relief. Poor Samuel L. Jackson and Bob Peck get devoured but at least they do put up one hell of a battle. Joseph Mazzello is a little annoying but cute and sometimes funny. Ariana Richards screams a lot but otherwise she's adequate.Perhaps it was because of my fascination with dinosaurs that I loved this movie as a child but for me 'Jurassic Park' has stood the test of time. I had just revisited it last night for the nth time and it felt awesome to watch. 1993 was perhaps the best year in Spielbergs career because that's the year he gave 'Schindler's List' and 'Jurassic Park'.","

"jzappa","10 February 2011","The father of the summer blockbuster tradition's third time around making the most commercially successful film ever is a real cinema signpost, presenting wonder- and terror-stimulating highlights, the more stunning of these concerning the ferocious, realistic dinosaurs that trail through the film with a still amazing simplicity. Just as intimidating, though, maybe more, are those features of Jurassic Park that determine it as the meteoric forerunner of a mint entertainment kingdom. Even while seizing the imagination of its enormous audience, this film sets the stage for the amusement park rides, sequels and souvenirs that assure the Jurassic Park event would continue for over a decade.The calculation of this cinematic marketing takeover didn't seem like it could be surpassed, because a whole age bracket had become infatuated with dinosaurs, turning the fossils of long ago into the monolithic props of the '90s. This at times almost unbearably intense thriller is still today a riveting, worthily scientific story of a classified theme park, branded for the age throughout which dinosaurs existed. Jurassic Park's centerpiece is actual sentient dinosaurs, which have been produced through the regeneration of dinosaur DNA taken from blood unearthed in prehistoric mosquitoes sealed in amber. The film describes this procedure by way of a ""Mr. D.N.A."" cartoon.Crichton, who adapted his source with David Koepp, relishes such particulars and illustrates his plot as a beguiling, fanatically comprehensive discourse on both the promise and harms of prevailing technology. The coolest character in Crichton's story, wry chaos theorist Ian Malcolm, is among various scientists taken to Jurassic Park to examine it before its opening. Faced with the seeming foolproof environment of this mechanized paradise, Malcolm is incredulous. He repeatedly refers to applied mathematics as a means of indicating that supposedly faultless representations have a way of toppling once they contend with the real world.Theoretically, this plot is custom-made for the talents of the man who could buy everyone on Hollywood's Power List, merging the alarm of Jaws with the state-of-the-art parable of E.T. and Close Encounters, and sure enough including the trial of constructing the dinosaurs themselves. In a few key scenes equaling the fright rate of Jaws, the difference is that this film's dinosaurs tread on its humans both literally and metaphorically, however persuasively sympathetic and amusingly distinctive the cast is. They show just for concise interludes, yet the they rule Jurassic Park in every sense. Remarkably fluid and realistic, they set an exorbitant benchmark for the still budding CGI. However, thinking about how those effects were pulled off aren't prone to arise while the film's in progress. The key to the dinosaurs of this undeniable pleasure is that they form a conquering fantasy. We believe we've hung around in a dinosaur-filled realm.That realm, on an island nearby Costa Rica, is the innovation of John Hammond, a tiresomely cheery gray eccentric who enlists Drs. Grant and Sattler as members of a party presumed to give Jurassic Park its stamp of support. But a quaint thing occurs en route to the Tyrannosaurus pen. Thanks to an business saboteur attempting to appropriate dinosaur embryos, power within this programmed theme park is deactivated. Enormous, unpleasant, ravenous creatures begin to roam free.Helming the dinosaurs' exploits is Spielberg's forte, and the professional dreamer's excitement is unmistakable. He has an immense party with every single roar and shudder indicating the advanceing threat, as when Malcolm notices a mud puddle tremble. He also hurdles to the test of composing inspired duels, as in a tremendous sequence where brutal velociraptors hunt Hammond's two grandchildren through the outsized kitchen of the visitor's center. Anybody can show a battle, but it takes Steven Spielberg to portray just how the pots and pans might go soaring at the thump of a velociraptor's tail, or how the children might mislead their cunning assailants. In considering such a scene, it also helps to behold the broader picture. Who but the most represented filmmaker on AFI's 100 Most Inspiring Movies of All Time could persuade an audience that there are dinosaurs at large in a kitchen by any means? But the film's deserving centerpiece is the sequence where the Tyrannosaurus scrutinizes and masticates a Jeep containing desperately frozen-stiff characters is one of the most exhilarating scenes ever put on film. It's hopeless discerning the effects from the real, and it's equally as suspenseful when you're 22 as when you're 5.His fourteenth film keeps us nervous while leaving much of its actual brutality to the mind. When it's dinosaur dinner time, Spielberg sidesteps obvious gore, getting a superior quiver out of showing farm animals that are left near the famished creatures and swiftly vanish. To give the velociraptors a fitting initiation, he starts the film with a character whose upper body stays seen while the rest of him is being accosted off screen, a la Jaws. Such tense and gruesome strokes are joined with over-romantic ones and intermittent droll sight gags and observations. As an action adventure, as an auteurist visualization, as a blockbuster, as a humanist assertion, however capitalistically inclined, it's a tour de force.","

"aidanratesmovies","8 June 2022","A thrilling and ambitious journey, Jurassic Park can suffer from a handful of formulaic tendencies- but that doesn't stop the film from its incredibly fun ideas and worthwhile execution. First off, the cast is just so well done in the film- from Laura Dern to Sam Neill to Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough- everyone just gives it their absolute all and it just works so well. The plot is simple, and at times a bit predictable- dinosaurs coming back to reality is always a fun idea however so thankfully to its execution it never feels bogged down too much narratively. I wasn't a huge fan of the kid characters throughout, the actors did fine, but I couldn't help but feel they were all but unnecessary- and only a plot device to see Neill's character grow. The special effects were of course brilliant at the time and mostly hold up rather well today. I love the combination of CGI and animatronic and feel it never surpassed the grand ideas this film had in terms of that collaboration in the future. The score is absolutely excellent, of course its iconic, but even lesser known tracks just flow so well throughout the film. In the end, Jurassic Park has some minor flaws here and there but is mostly a fun and solid little adventure flick that for once deserves the hype.My Rating: 9.3/10.","

"justin-fencsak","30 April 2018","My dad was a huge fan of the book Jurassic Park and its sequel, The Lost World. The books became huge hits when Universal bought the rights from Michael Crichton three years before the movie came out, months before Spielberg's academy award winning movie, Schindler's List, came out. I was too young to see this movie as I was only 10 years old and dad was undecided on if I'd like it or not due to the pg-13 rating. I grew up being fascinated with dinosaurs after seeing exhibits about them and seeing them in cartoons and playing with them as toys as in Dino Riders. When i finally saw the movie on vhs more than a year after it was in theaters (dad saw it in Wayne Preakness, one of the few theaters that showed it in DTS 5.1, with my stepmom kathy two years before they got married), i loved it!! I saw it a few more times then bought the movie on tape at now gone Suncoast and I still have that tape somewhere lol. The CGI still stands the test of time nearly 25 years after it came out and the action is nonstop yet it drags a bit. The sequel that followed it, The lost world, i saw twice, first with my family and the second one with a group of boys and girls club teens and thought it was the best jurassic sequel. Jurassic Park III was the weakest in the franchise until Jurassic World became a humongous hit. Hopefully fallen kingdom is ok....","

"OllieSuave-007","4 May 2001","I first watched this movie in the theaters and it was one heck of a ride. Here, two doctors who studied prehistoric plants and dig dinosaur bones were invited by a billionaire to his theme park, inhabited by cloned dinosaurs brought back to life by preserved DNA. All goes well as the doctors, joined by an attorney, a mathematician and the billionaire's grandkids, tour the park. But, all is chaos when a greedy park technician, wanting to smuggle dinosaur embryos off the island in exchange for some big cash, shuts down the park so he alone can escape, which releases he dinosaurs from their confinement. Then, it is a fight for survival for those remaining on the island as the dinosaurs roam free. The dinosaurs are very realistic and inspiring, very well-executed. The special and visual effects used to bring the creatures to life take the meaning of a dinosaur film to a whole new level. Each of the actors gave a memorable and solid performance in their respectable roles. I especially enjoyed actor Martin Ferrero's role as Donald Gennaro; him hiding in a public restroom trying to escape from the just-escape T-Rex is one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. I also enjoyed Jeff Goldblum's role as Ian Malcolm, as he gave the movie needed humor with comedy relief. Sam Neill and Laura Dern delivered good drama and on-screen comprehension and Bob Peck did an excellent and daring job as ""game"" warden. The music by John Williams is terrific and very haunting; his theme for the first appearance of the Brachosaurus will etch in the minds of many and will go on to become this movie's signature theme. Director Steven Spielberg gave some of his finest work, giving us a movie with a solid plot and a charming story that will delight an audience of all ages for years to come. And, all the running, screaming, and thrilling scenes of the dinosaurs and the human characters are edge-of-the-seat excitement.Excellent dinosaur film and definitely one of the greatest movies of its time.Grade A","

"WhyIhateNetflix","19 June 2022","This movie has done a lot of good for our field. It has brought many of the ideas of the Dinosaur revolution of the 1960-1980s in the spotlight for all to see. Unlike the less well-done movies after, this one actually is fairly factual in terms of the current Dinosaur knowledge at the time. If you want good Dinosaurs its better to watch prehistoric planet than watch Jurassic world nowadays,
. However, this remains a timeless masterpiece that inspired me and many of my colleagues to go into paleontology.","

"OMTR","7 February 2022","Jurassic Park is above all the genius of Steven Spielberg - even if it is not his greatest masterpiece most scenes are a genuine signature moment - and not just a ""popular blockbuster"" as some might think, or like to call it. But, well and truly, an excellent critique of lawless corporate avarice, which invests new technologies without any humility towards the planet and its resources: Death Economy, which transgress otherwise gigantic cosmic and planetary laws compared to this primate human being who can be so arrogant and imbued with his small person, is hauled over the coals. An adventure 65 million years in the making, which hasn't aged a bit for thirty years.","

"hitchcockthelegend","12 March 2009","Science has advanced so far, to the point that scientists are able to clone dinosaurs to populate an island. Turning it into a maximum security theme park seemed to be a good idea, but when human mischief and a breakdown of said security occurs, the result is terrifying.One of the unwritten facts in cinema history is that some folk, no matter what he does, will deride Steven Spielberg's achievements in movie making. Be it popcorn bonanza's such as this dinosaur riot, or the serious, emotionally wrought likes of Schindler's List which was released this same year, Spielberg is not a popular name amongst the arty farty set. Thankfully, those people are in the minority because Spielberg and his movies cater for the mass majority of the honest cash paying movie fan, he is by definition a fan himself, to hear him interviewed and chatter away about cinematic greats such as David Lean is as enlightening as it is as entertaining as his best work.Jurassic Park finds Spielberg directing like a child locked in a sweet shop, all the tools available to him are used with gleeful abandon, the result being one of the most enjoyable sci-fi/fantasy/monster/disaster movies of the 90s. Going on to make a lifetime gross, at the time of writing, of $914,691,118 after being made for just $63 million, I think it's safe to say that Jurassic Park is loved by a lots and lots of people. The charges of the actors being secondary are of course warranted, at times stilted and plain, Laura Dern, Sam Neil, and even Richard Attenborough, possibly do their respective career phone ins; but that's OK in a film of this type, besides, elsewhere Jeff Goldblum rises to the challenge as Ian Malcolm, all quirky and sly, Goldblum gets to look cool and gives the picture it's comedic relief.However, we are ultimately here for the terror, the rampaging dinosaurs expertly assembled at ILM are a pure feast for the eyes, with Spielberg brilliantly creating edge of the seat set piece after set piece. Craftily he lulls us into a false sense of security {aided by screenwriter and novel writer Michael Crichton of course}, it's all lovely, vegetable eating dinosaurs and kiddie friendly fodder. But then, oh then, it's hello T-Rex, Raptors and thrills on the edge of your seats, from that point in it's time to strap yourself in for a magical roller-coaster ride. Thank you Steven Spielberg, Hollywood would be a poorer place without your efforts. 9/10","

"ametaphysicalshark","3 August 2007","One of the very first things we learn during the credits after ""Jurassic Park"" is that it is based on a novel by Michael Crichton, and that the screenplay was written by Michael Crichton with the help of David Koepp. It's for the best that he decided to pen his first screenplay since 1978's ""Coma"" when ""Jurassic Park"" went into development because it's hard to imagine a screenplay based on his dark sci-fi horror novel being successful in the same way this screenplay was. Crichton, writing a screenplay based on his own work, opted to change the tone and much of the plot for this Hollywood production. Rather than the dark sci-fi the novel is, ""Jurassic Park"" the movie is a fun, relatively light-hearted action adventure, and the decision to change the tone might go down in history as one of the smartest screen writing decisions in history.This is simply an exceptional film. Technically, it is an astounding achievement. As of 2007, fourteen years after ""Jurassic Park"" was released, its special affects are still excellent compared to many mainstream films. Steven Spielberg did no wrong with this film; you can't really criticize anything about it. The public likes Michael Bay because he blows up a lot of expensive stuff and films the explosions, but if one was to list the flaws in one Michael Bay film they could fill dozens of pages. But really, what's wrong with ""Jurassic Park""? The answer is: nothing. You can't fault the gorgeous cinematography, as there are more greatshots in this film than all the summer blockbusters of recent years put together and you certainly can't fault John Williams' classic score. So where does the criticism come from? Some think ""Jurassic Park"" could've been darker and dealt more with its central theme- don't mess with nature. Some think ""Jurassic Park"" doesn't build suspense for long enough, and shows the dinosaurs too often. This claims are without basis because ""Jurassic Park"" never claimed to be a deep film with heavy subtext (there is subtext, but it is dealt with only superficially), nor did it want to be ""Jaws"" (more like ""Indiana Jones"" with dinosaurs). One thing that has to be understood is that this is an action adventure. It eliminates the majority of the science and techno-babble from Crichton's novel, condensing it to a few minutes near the start of the film. The cast is memorable, in particular Sam Neill as Alan Grant, who really reminds me of Indiana Jones in a sense. The character is adventurous, smart, and funny and I really can't imagine anyone else playing him quite as well as Sam Neill did. Laura Dern, an exceptional actress who should've won awards for certain performances in certain David Lynch films, is good here as are Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. The child actors could've been more annoying, which when speaking of child actors in general is a compliment.There are few films in existence as exciting as ""Jurassic Park"", and there are very, very few, if any at all, summer blockbusters as perfectly-made and memorable as this. If you're looking for intriguing science fiction dealing with intricate themes, this is not the place for it. There is depth to ""Jurassic Park"", but for meditative science fiction there are certainly better options. Watch this if you want to be entertained, or just to see an example of utterly phenomenal film-making.****/4","

"ccthemovieman-1","18 March 2006","Well, I have to hand it to Steven Spielberg, even though he often annoys me. He made us pay attention to archeology and the Ark Of The Covenant; he educated us on Great White Sharks;, a made us love an ugly little space alien and he even made Whoopi Goldberg look good. Wow, say what you will, the man has done some amazing things in the world of film. Here, he brings dinosaurs back to life and gives us another classic adventure story, unlike anything seen up to this time. I rank this one right up with the best of all-time among great adventure stories. Few people can forget how stunned they were when they viewed these life-like dinosaurs for the first time on screen. And who can forget the T-Rex in the first frightening scene and the Raptors in the last intense scene? This is truly memorable stuff. To this day, those scenes can still get your attention.The movie has always been fun to watch, and not just because of the thrills or special effects, of which there are too many to recite here. There is humor in here and characters are interesting, led by Richard Attenborough as the scientist who creates Jurassic Park. The kids in here - Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards - do a fine job of acting, as good as the adults.This isn't perfect by any means. There are some negatives such as the usual Spielberg plugs for liberal/secular causes, but I'd rather keep this review on the positive side, since it was so entertaining and ground-breaking, in a way, with the special effects, plus anyone who is slightest bit interested has already seen this movie at least once and probably more.","

"Leporinum","18 June 2015","This movie was released during my childhood while I was already a dinosaur enthusiast. I saw it 2 times at the cinema and as far as I can remember these were the only 2 times I ever saw an audience applaud at the end. It made an big impression. Computer generated images were new at that time and we didn't know what to expect. But I think I can speak for everyone if I say we were blown away. The dinosaurs looked so real. And even in the years after that computer generated images in other movies were just not as good and realistic as in Jurassic Park.Another thing that made this movie is the soundtrack. John Williams (the composer) absolutely nailed it! The music at the arrival to the island combined with the the adventure ahead was just breathtaking.So you have a good story, good actors (I loved Jeff Goldblum for his humor), state of the art special effects and an thrilling adventure. This makes it still my number one of all time and I don't expect that to change anytime soon (or ever).","

"vishaal811","23 July 2015","Jurassic Park is an adaptation of the novel of the same name written by Michael Crichton. Even though the movie cuts various parts of the novel, it manages to capture the essence upon which the story is built.This movie combines elements of science fiction, horror, and suspense which makes this film a singular achievement in the realm of cinema. Despite the ubiquity of CGI in today's big budget blockbusters, no other movie has utilized visual effects more effectively to tell a story than Jurassic Park. The casting is so good that there is no element that can be criticized. Both the child actors do a wonderful job as they have as much screen time as their vastly experienced compatriots. John Williams, Steven Spielberg's frequent collaborator, has once again given an iconic score that has one of the most memorable tunes ever written.There is hardly any aspect of Jurassic Park that I did not enjoy. In the beginning, there is a genuine sense of wonder at the unbelievable feat of recreating dinosaurs. At the end, we dread the sight of these creatures due to several horrific incidents during the course of this movie. It combines all these elements due to which it can be enjoyed by children and adults as well. It is a memorable movie and I cannot give you any more reasons to go out there and watch it right now.","

"alindsayal","12 December 2021","With Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom coming to Netflix on Friday I have decided to go back and rewatch the other films in the franchise starting with the legendary Jurassic Park and here is my review. The premise of the film sees a group of experts sent to an island where an excentric Billionaire has cloned Dinosaurs for an amusement park, but the obvious happens leading to the beasts escaping and causing chaos.Main Character
Sam Neil plays Dr Alan Grant and he is great in the film. He is basically the audience as he is mesmerised by the dinosaurs and as an expert in the field he gives us the lowdown on the different dinosaurs. He has a great mix of gruff and charm which makes him an interesting character, he also has an arc which fleshes his character out even more changing him up from where he starts the film.Supporting Characters
We have one of the greatest supporting characters in any movie here, with Jeff Goldblum playing Dr Ian Malcolm. He is so charismatic and cool, he has one liners coming out of everywhere and it makes him the guy that you are drawn to when he is on screen even with huge dinosaurs here. Laura Dern plays Ellie and does a really good job, she is a strong female character and one you can root for really easily. One thing I noticed here more then before is just how good the late Richard Attenborough is as Hammond, he is such an interesting character who goes through a phylosophical journey through the film and sees his character have a fascinating arc. Samuel L Jackson, the kids and all the other smaller roles are good and help boost the film even more.Story
The story here is brilliant, for the first half of the plot you are wowed by the dinosaurs and the park itself. Also the characters are all really interesting and the debates they have about science and morales is really interesting and full of depth. Then the 2nd half of the film is where everything goes wrong and the film becomes a brilliant thriller, you care about the characters and the film builds the tension really well. Seeing the different dinoasurs and how they react to the people is great to see and it does a great job in it's ending not sequel baiting, even though we would get sequels.Script
The script is great, as I have mentioned there are some really interesting debates about whether the idea of cloning Dinosaurs is right or wrong and the characters make it interesting. The humour is here, Goldblum brings so many laughs here and the drama is well handled too.Style
This is where the film is at it's best, this film's style changed cinema in my opinion. Along with Terminator 2 this film is heavily credited with progressing CGI and animatronics, the dinoasurs look incredible, better then some things that come out now and this film came out in 1993 it is just incredible. Watch this film for the amazing effects alone and get a film that hits every level with it. Plus this film has one of the best scores ever by the legendary John Williams,Overall
Overall, this is one of those epic and special films that have been made. The awe and wonder of the film is a real highlight and this is a must watch for people that haven't seen it.Rating - 10/10.","

"BobbySixkillerHammond","29 October 2014","This movie is simply a legend. A date in history of cinema.With Terminator 2, Jurassic Park is one of the first movie that shows wonderful CGI. And now, it is forever one of the best, until his 21 years. Everything is just awesome. Spielberg at the summum of his art, John Williams create another time a legendary ost, and all the actors are just more than best, and especially two of the them. Richard Attenborough(RIP) play John Hammond, owner of Ingen and creator of Jurassic park. He is a very great actor (and director). He don't play John Hammond, for everybody who love cinema, he is John Hammond. And Sam Neil, what can i say about him ? Simply he is one genius. He is at the best with playing Alan Grant. For some people, he became just one role. Watching him in another program, i am sur that somebody would automatically said : it's the guy from Jurassic Park, Doctor Grant ! And that is the best for an actor, he leave his mark in the collective inconscious. Sam Neil is more an actor, he is a great man.","

"blackwidowis7cool","23 July 2019","John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) creates this park called ""Jurassic Park"" where he recreates the dinosaurs using DNA found in fossils (but also having to use frog DNA to complete it - don't ask me why, I don't quite remember all the technical stuff).
But before Hammond can open it to the public, he has to get it approved. So, he hires some fossil finders (played by Sam Neill and Laura Dern) to go to the park and look through it without telling them what occupies the park. Anyway, they go there and Hammond gets them to take his grandchildren along after the fossil finders express concern about the park's safety with the dinosaurs. A hippie scientist-type guy Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by the great Jeff Goldblum) also accompanies them as well as a lawyer.
That's where things start to go wrong. The dinosaurs escape. I won't say anymore, though.
I loved it! I think it is one of the greatest films of all time and is certainly a classic. I don't understand why everyone thinks this film is scary. It's not - apart from a couple scenes like the start and something later on. A lot of film writers should watch this and take notes on how to do tension as this film has brilliant tension.
It has quite a good sense of humour, and ""Jurassic Park"" is generally suitable for children, though you might want to fast forward the very start and maybe one or two other scenes, but generally, I think that children can watch it, though it depends on the individual child and what they can or can't handle.
Another brilliant subplot in the film is with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his dislike for children. During most of the danger, he is stuck with Hammond's grandchildren. There is great chemistry between him and the children.
Jurassic Park is a brilliant movie.
Hats off to you, Mr Spielberg!","

"jonny_","9 June 2022","When anyone asks what my favourite movie of all time, Jurassic Park is almost always amongst my first thoughts and it has remained that way since 1993.Maybe a slightly controversial opinion, but this is my favourite Spielberg movie and considering his body of work it's possibly the highest praise I could bestow upon it.Everything about it is near perfect, the effects, the cast, the story, the direction, the dialogue, the pacing, the ending. Obviously after 30 years the early computer effects do show a little age, but honestly they still hold up compared to modern movies. I'd say that is largely down to having a fantastic director at the helm and the fact they combined them with practical puppets/models. The lighting and using early CGI sparingly hides any major aging. Whereas newer films might have better effects but use so much that they can feel false, almost closer to a video game and you can still tell when they're in use. But here we're still on location and with the T-Rex paddock scene or the Triceratops those are still genuine practical effects, there is more reality because of that effort.Other than that, this movie will remain timeless it is one of very few movies that just has that level of quality. It's cliche but Steven Spielberg really has that golden touch, just think of how easy it would be to take the concept of a dinosaur island and make it too silly or a forgettable gore/horror movie. To make it into an all time classic is just true testament to the man.","

"EthanBJones_03","25 October 2016","Overall: If you haven't seen this movie you must. Truly amazing and one of Spielberg's best movies.Good: The concept is awesome, the effects would be groundbreaking at the time and still look pretty good though can be seen as a tad dated. The acting is great all around bar one exception. The music is phenomenal as is the cinematography. John Hammon's character just emits a level of charisma which is hard to ignore and makes you like him. Ian's sarcastic attitude make for some interesting dialogue and some interesting scenes. The two child actors do a great job even if there characters need some work. Great moral of ""Even if we can, should we?"".Bad: The female scientist's acting didn't suffice and her character was just not that interesting either. The children's characters weren't interesting or anything special that you want to root for them. The effects could be seen as a tad bit dated despite looking great. Some subplots are left hanging and there are some stupid plot holes that are just threw in there hoping we wouldn't notice. Best Part: When you first see the TREX MVP: Richard Attenborough as John Hammond10/10","

"Ggconte","10 June 2022","With the new Jurassic World movie coming out, I decided to go back and watch the entire franchise again. It's always interesting to see whether or not some of these older movies within the franchise hold up. I can say with absolute certainty that Jurassic Park holds up just as well today as it did in 1993.Directed by Steven Spielberg and co-written by the actual author of the original novel Michael Crichton and David Keopp, Jurassic Park actually has a very simple plot for such a big budget movie. It is about a group of people who are brought to a theme park that is still in development. The theme park is centered around dinosaurs. However, it's not just centered around the science or the old fossils, but they have managed to genetically engineer their own crop of living and breathing dinosaurs. The group consist of scientists and children to give their approval or disapproval of the park. Needless to say, things don't go quite as planned as those involved learn a very harsh lesson on whether or not dinosaurs and humans could coexist.While it is simple in it's plot, it wasn't so simple in its production. This movie elected to take a huge step, not only in digital effects but also in practical as well. The dinosaurs are re-created beautifully with both digital re-creation and animatronics. In fact, I would argue that the animatronic Tyrannosaurus rex is one of the best animatronics in film history. It is so real in its expressions and movements that it's absolutely terrifying. The digital work also matches up with the animatronic work as well, and is one of the most convincing movies when dealing with both of those elements.The films tone is also a great mix of drama, comedy and horror. Those are three very difficult tones to fuse together, and plenty of films have crumbled when trying. So my hats off to Spielberg on that because he manages to do it effortlessly.Spielberg also made a great decision in filming on location in Hawaii, because it gives the movie an unmatched beauty to its look. That is something that I feel has been lost in modern day movie making, because sometimes filming on location helps the audience feel like they are actually there.However, one element about the film that really helps bring that sense of realism to this outlandish story is the cast. This film is unbelievably well acted, and this is one of those projects where the cast can make or break the movie. I have seen plenty of films that have outlandish plot lines and the cast knows it, and that comes across in their performances. This is not one of those movies, because this cast really helps drive the plot, and makes you feel like this could actually happen.So overall, Jurassic Park is one of the very few movies that I have felt comfortable giving 10 stars. It is one of those movies that is perfect in all categories, and is a movie that should've been allowed to stand on its own.","

"nathanjamesemerson","24 September 2018","I will start off by saying the novel Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton is my favourite novel of all time. I first read it when I was 12, and about a year before the movie came out.Needless to say, I was pumped for the film. I loved dinosaurs since I was six years old and couldn't wait for the movie.Even at that age I was a movie buff and knew that movie adaptions of books are never 100% accurate. And Jurassic Park was no different.Obviously marketed towards young children, the movie toned down a lot of the violence which happened in the novel. Understandably. But the movie was still full of jump scares and still retained the adventurous side of the novel down to a T.Steven Spielberg always amazes and this film possessed the cutting edge of technology at the time. The CGI and practical effects were amazing. This is how a movie with CGI should look like today. Have real environments with CGI elements. Unlike most movies today where 99% of the screen is CGI.Steven takes us on an amazing adventure through Jurassic Park along with fine actors such as Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum, Linda Dream and Sir Richard Attenborough. The science behind the movie made it seem like it could really bring dinosaurs to life.I always wondered what a dinosaur would look like. And Jurassic Park showed me. A beautifully shot film with an equally beautiful score by John Williams.Check out the novel if you haven't read it as well","

"krational66","14 May 2020","Extremely good stunts, and the imagination of the sea and the sky. Spielberg is indeed a very great director. Looking back last night, the dinosaurs made by those stunts are still very, very cute, and the image of free walking in the primitive forest living freely is popular. This led me to be more familiar and familiar with the animals 60 million years ago than many animals that still exist today. At the tension of the plot, the brutal shot also scared me to blindfold. There are few loopholes.
One of the most interesting discoveries is that in this film, due to the high development of technology and the extensive use of computer special effects, Spielberg has questioned modern science through the genetic engineering of dinosaurs: can science make humans think they are the world The master of can control nature and transcend nature? Of course, the answer given by the director is no. It can be seen that this reflects the modern West's understanding of the limitations of science after introspection of science since the 20th century. Science cannot be an excuse for human arrogance. However, this does not affect the greatness of science. After all, because of the development of science, Spielberg can create, we can see the image of a dinosaur living freely in nature 60 million years ago.","

"KineticSeoul","10 April 2013","I remember watching this movie when I was just a elementary school student and wasn't all that entertained with this movie. Except the dinosaur parts since it just didn't meet my prospect of things when it comes to a entertaining movie when I was a kid. But watching it now, I can really appreciate this movie and what it does. In fact it's one of the best dinosaur or some creatures that attack people type of movies I have ever seen. I recently saw this movie in theaters in 3D and it still meets even today's standards when it comes to great movies. Steven Spielberg is a visionary director and he really put everything he had into this movie. The CGI still holds up but what amazes me is how they used animatronic dinosaurs for the dinosaur scenes. This movie came out in 1993 and even the cinematography still hold up. The characters are well grafted into the story and stands out despite the two annoying kids. Even if it does have slightly cliché moments with one of the character predicting all the outcome but most of the people just won't listen to the guy scenarios. But then again this movie came out in 1993. The build up is just fantastic in this movie and although a bit far-fetched the way it's shown makes it believable, like everything in this movie is possible. The plot is about a rich old guy that decides use his money to clone dinosaurs and make a dino theme park but things just doesn't go according to plan. And it really does seem like a real theme park, mainly because of all the small details and effort that is put in the settings and backgrounds. Even the freaking theme song is so darn catchy and memorable. Go watch this movie in theaters now! It's what movie going experience is all about.9/10","

But also with the likes of Richard Attenborough, Martin Ferrero, BD Wong, Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Knight on the cast list. So you are in quite capable hands as these performers bring the characters to life on the screen.Visually then ""Jurassic Park"" was spectacular when it was initially released back in 1993. Sure, the effects are starting to show fatigue and they are 30 years old already, but I will go as far as saying that the special effects and CGI in ""Jurassic Park"" still holds here in 2023, and actually is still better than a lot of more recently released movies. So that certainly counts for something of an achievement. And with ""Jurassic Park"" being a movie about dinosaur, then having realistic and believable creatures on the screen was a must, and they most certainly did have that.Not only is the visual great in ""Jurassic Park"", but the score as well. The music is very atmospheric and suitable for the movie. And that main theme definitely has a ring to it, doesn't it? Right up there alongside themes such as ""Star Wars"", ""Jaws"" and ""Indiana Jones""If you haven't already seen the 1993 movie ""Jurassic Park"", then it is well due time to do so, because this movie is entertaining, enjoyable and was a fantastic kick off for a great movie franchise.""Jurassic Park"" is a timeless classic, a movie that can be watched again and again, and that just makes it all the more enjoyable.My rating of ""Jurassic Park"" lands on an eight out of ten stars.","

"thesterlingweaver","20 December 2021","This movie did have a slow start and confusing ending, but It is great and I shouldn't even explain why, it's original, it's quotable, emotional, etc. The characters: funny and memorable. The score? OH MY GOD, THE SCORE, ITS SO BEAUTIFUL AND UNIQUE, I ALMOST CRIED BY HOW AMAZING THE THEME IS, THE TIMING OF IT IS SO PERFECT. I could go on more but I don't wanna break my fingers telling you things you already know.","

"bradykitchen-33648","12 June 2022","On a remote island a theme park has been built that features genetically engineered dinosaurs, but after a worker was killed by a velociraptor the owner of the park John Hammond, must make sure it is safe before opening to the public.I remember watching this movie as a kid but I do not remember most of it. So this is essentially my first time watching the film and my god is it good.The entire film is mesmerizing, as we learn more and more about the park and the wonderful creatures inside it. That is all of course because of the phenomenal direction by Steven Spielberg. His ability to create an amazingly immersive experience is astonishing and something everyone must see.The cast is across the board perfect with amazing performances from them all. There isn't really one standout character in this film all of them have a role to play and a character arc to go through. I will individually mention the performance from Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as they both give great performances as kids which is not a common thing.This movie also has some great horror type elements to it, with some really well timed jump scares as well as a constant sense of tension throughout.My only gripe is there are a couple of unrealistic moments. Now I know it is a movie about genetically engineered dinosaurs but certain things happen that just don't make sense, but it's not a common occurrence.Overall Jurassic Park is a quality film with phenomenal direction, great storytelling, and an amazing cast.9.5/10

Growing up, I enjoyed adventure and fantasy movies or stories more than anything, they gave me a sense of hope, great comfort and made me wonder about the world.""Jurassic Park"" gave children of my age the biggest joy of our lives, years after the movie came out we would still be talking about dinosaurs! I remember a little girl who drew dinosaurs on the street, wishing they were real and she could see one. Her kind of hope still brings tears to my eyes.""Jurassic Park"" is more than just a movie, it's a magic adventure my generation will never forget. Thank you Steven Spielberg!

"view_and_review","28 August 2018","I saw Jurassic Park in the drive-in back in 1993.** For those of you not familiar with this nearly dead form of movie viewing, it is an outdoor theater where you watch the movie in your car. There are a few of these relics in existence but most are flea markets now.Jurassic Park, much like Star Wars and Terminator 2 before it, was groundbreaking stuff. We had never seen something like it before on screen. It ushered in the concept of DNA to a wide audience in the most effective and believable way... and then there were the dinosaurs. Oooooh weee how about them dinosaurs. I'd never seen something so real on screen. This movie made believers out of everybody. Little did I know then that this movie would be so revolutionary as to spawn a trilogy and another couple of movies in the same vein over 20 years later. Jurassic Park is iconic and forever etched in cinema history.","

He surprises them when the electricity is off spoiler you know I'm Sirius. Jeff goldblum is amazing in this film and he always talks to him self for some reason loll. He is great and started his career too. The scaler is what makes this film great. Forget the comedy in the film the score is also amazing. Act 1 is not slow one of the only gret movies that has no slow acts. Act 2 great Jackson kills it hold on to ur buts. great time Dodson is amazing in this film. Numan is the guy that dies he gets killed by the bird dinosaur. The kids are actually not annoying unlike Jurassic world or any other film. Act 3 great ending everybody lived NOT. Jackson dies. He kids help unlock the doors. The dinosaurs were cgied and movie that gave it a chance they were going to use stop motion but Spielberg saw it said there's ur future. Richard Attenboroughddied but he made the park and left. It's really the best dinosaur movie by far.","

"FeastMode","25 June 2019","Whenever I talk about how I dislike most older movies, I frequently hear the argument that you should judge them for their time. I disagree. If it doesn't hold up on rewatches, it's a bad movie in my eyes. Jurassic Park is the perfect example for my argument. It came out almost 30 years ago and I still love it today as much as I did when it was released.This is such an awesome movie. It has great directing with expertly crafted scenes that ooze tension. Tons of memorable and intense moments. Very suspenseful. Great characters. One of my favorite musical scores. It's impressive how realistic they made everything look with the severely limited technology of the times. And I adore the horror elements. (about 7 viewings, 5/26/2022)","

"christophershobris","23 September 2015","What an impact this film has had and still has. Never before have we seen dinosaurs on the screen in this magnitude. Even today nothing and nobody has done to dinosaurs what this film has done a film that unlike Jaws were not necessarily terrified to go into the water or in this case a zoo. With this we feel awed like we are looking over the Grand Canyon when we first see Jurassic Park. When I go to watch I don't just watch it for the casual sake of doing so because when I watch this it is an unbelievable and exhilarating experience that can appeal to the likes of anybody with a pulse. Another stand out is John Williams outstanding score that will be listened to for years to come even after 20 years it still holds up and that is the magic of Steven Spielberg as only he can bring us such a one of a kind experience and a film that gives a reason why we love films in the first place. The only negative I would have to say is the performance by Ariana Richards as Lex and Bob Peck performance is a bit overdone. Other then that this is a near perfect film. Now to grade. Story: B Characters: B+ Acting: B- Visual Effects (for 1993): A Music: A+ Scenes: A Overall: A-","

"moviemattb","14 June 2015","""Jurassic Park"" has been around for twenty two years, and it has been one of those movies that has always been part of my childhood and it is definitely one of my all time favorite movies. This is the best of best, because none of the sequels lived up to the original. So the story is about an old man name John Hammond, who invites three doctors alongside with a lawyer to show them that dinosaurs are alive and real, and shows them how they were actually created after they were extinct sixty five million years ago (If anyone knows math on what I just typed). So he sets up a tour for them, but things go haywire as dinosaurs start to break loose when the power goes out during the storm, and it is a chance for our main characters to survive and to get off an island that is filled with dinosaurs. I did not see on the big screen back in 1993, but only saw it on home video. However, I was able to have the opportunity to see it on the big screen, but only this time in 3D as it came out back in 2013 for honoring the film's twentieth anniversary and I really had a blast to see it like I never had before. I love this movie, and it just never ages for me. To me, it feels timeless as if this movie was made today or any other time that was made. Of course, this movie was famous for its use of groundbreaking digital technology, and I know many filmmakers when nuts about this and it does upset many people that they choose to use CGI over practical effects. Although not many filmmakers overuse CGI as they decide to remain old school, but still use CGI if its done right. With that said, I thought it had a very good story from beginning to end as you first introduce the characters, then you show the island and how it went wrong, and you see how these characters are able to survive. The characters are very good, and likable at the same time. Sam Neill; Jeff Goldblum; Laura Dern and Richard Attenborough all gave out such terrific performances on their own; they may not be three dimensional, but there is still enough characterization in the movie and still to care about. The two child actors all did great too. The movie is filled with wonders, excitements and having some pretty good actions. Steven Spielberg has made such beautiful looking movie, and knows how to make a movie about how much we like about dinosaurs. John Williams' music is so darn memorable, and it is completely unforgettable. The special effects done by Stan Winston Studios and Industrial Light & Magic are top notch perfect for the use of practical and CGI effects. They continue to look impressive as I watch it, and it never feels dated for my own personal taste. If I had to pick what is my favorite dinosaur, I would say the T-Rex which it is obvious that everyone loves the T- Rex. I do love the scene where we first meet T-Rex as it has perfect build up that is perfectly suspense, and it is perfectly well edited together. Heck, the movie doesn't bored me and it was always keeps my interest. The ending that everyone remembers when the T- Rex saves Dr. Grant and the others by Raptors was awesome. I do love how the movie ends, where they finally go home in a helicopter and it gives you that good feeling as Williams' music plays along as the movie ends. I love ""Jurassic Park"" so much, and this classic twenty two year old movie is still awesome! I give it a perfect 10 out of 10.","

"sol-","24 January 2016","It might sound like little more than 'Jaws' with dinosaurs as this Steven Spielberg thriller focuses on mayhem at an amusement park where dinosaurs have been brought back to life, but 'Jurassic Park' a unique and exciting thriller in its own right and one that stands up to multiple viewings. The dinosaurs are quite breathtaking CGI creations, and more than that, they are menacing at all the right times. The dinosaur attacks are very well done with Spielberg not relying on music (sort of the opposite of 'Jaws') and instead dead silence to render the attacks frightening. Spielberg throws a lot of neat directing tricks in the mix too, such as extreme close-ups on Samuel L. Jackson's technician and decent doses of humour, like an 'objects in mirror are closer than they appear' warning visible as a dinosaur roars into an automobile side mirror. Not so successful are the film's attempts to drill home messages such as the risks of tampering with nature, all spelled out through character dialogue. The way the child-hating Sam Neill eventually learns to bond with kids is also so forced and obvious from early on that it never really works despite a credible turn from Ariana Richards as a surrogate daughter of sorts. In fact, the film is very well acted overall, give or take Wayne Knight's inappropriately comical performance as the closest the film has a human antagonist. The strongest of the cast is Jeff Goldblum as a mathematician who finds himself often talking to himself, but Jackson, Neill and Richard Attenborough as the amusement park owner have their strong moments too.","

"leplatypus","19 May 2011","This is the great joke of Spielberg seeing the famous stick of Hammond and its mosquito trapped in the sap! Beyond the special effects, this movie remains for me a essential milestone: it speaks about the power of nature, the childish ingenuity of man, human relationships. I forget that it is also funny with the boy character and lines. John William's score is another masterpiece from him because it rejoices ancestral, primitive melody with powerful and peaceful theme.There are also a lot of remarkable ideas: dealing with dinosaurs today is fascinating but mixing them with the theme park and locating all this on a remote island is a great chain of genius. And the best thing is the parallelism between the technology resurrecting extinct animals and the same technology making extinct the traditional craft of special effects. In this field, there is a before and after JP and the first attack of the T-Rex will be on pantheon of filmmaking! However, the extras of the DVD offer a glimpse of puppets velociraptors (made by Tipett) and they are surprisingly cool as well.Having finishing reading the book, I can say that novel and movie are very close: it's like the same story told by two witnesses even if there are some changes. Having the author writing the script seems to be the golden rule of a decent adaptation. But you can understand also the strength of each medium: ""T-Rex roars and attacks the jeep"" is better seen than read. On the opposite, all the remarkable speeches of Malcom about chaos and science are better read than heard!","

"bkrauser-81-311064","10 January 2014","I recently had a conversation with a friend about the filmography of the great Steven Spielberg. My friend, who is considerably younger than me, tried to argue Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) was not the horrifying, stupefying train wreck that it was. While I could probably go into the technical reasons that movie is an abomination, my arguments were limited to a concentrated level of hatred indirectly flung at my friend with reckless abandon. I stopped myself before things got out of hand but I realized one thing; generational bias does matter when it comes to movies and our discussion hit a little too close to home.It matters for many when I say I prefer Jurassic Park (1993) over Jaws (1975). I'm not saying one is a better movie over the other, all I'm saying is I prefer the movie that first capitalized on my obsession with dinosaurs when I was six, over one I saw in high school because I wanted to be a Spielberg completest. I much rather watch the movie I saw peering through holes in my own clammy palms than the movie I tried figuring out ""what that guy was in."" To put it bluntly, in the imagination of the child I was and the child I still am inside, Jurassic Park is first in my heart.Jurassic Park is still the premier movie I recommend to Spielberg novices. It encompasses everything that artificially created the childhood of those raised in the nineties; a childlike sense of wonder, visionary special effects and a score by John Williams who composed the anthems of at least two generations. Additionally the film showcases the acting abilities of thespian veterans Richard Attenborough and Jeff Goldblum, familiar faces like Laura Dern, Samuel L. Jackson and Wayne Night and strong novice performances by Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello.Under the surface of Jurassic Park lies its cautionary tale written by David Koepp and Michael Crichton. A modern retelling of Frankenstein only instead of one misunderstood ogre the characters are faced with a menagerie of primal monsters. That and the movie doesn't mind cranking the scare-meter up to eleven. Those who have seen the movie no doubt will instantly recall the scene with the children versus the velociraptors. It's a scene that would have made anyone in the audience scream lengthily along with Joseph Mazzello's character.Those who know me know I'm not a fan of the theme of science and technology overreaching and causing something horrific. If we were scared of every boogie man that could happen, we would have never left that cave. That's not to say we shouldn't acknowledge the dangers of bringing dinosaurs back from the dead. We should acknowledge that it's a double edged sword for sure. But there's no doubt that finding our limits is what makes humanity great and we shouldn't limit ourselves because Mary Shelley, Michael Crichton or Jerry Falwell tells us to.But if you're looking for deeper meanings in a Spielberg film (other than the phallic appearance of E.T.) you're trailing up the wrong Devil's Monument. Spielberg's main goal is to entertain. Does that make him a less talented or less important director? Does that make him a huckster of the Barnum Bailey variety? I would argue that film can be used as an art form, as a form of entertainment and/or a form of storytelling with many, many overlapping traditions in-between. If a director's intent is to tell a good story which is what Spielberg does, then who am I or anyone else to judge? Movies are the things of dreams and Spielberg doesn't cheat in giving you the goods.A great yarn, a pulse pounding theme park ride, a childhood memory; Jurassic Park is all that and more. It was a movie that intelligently combined the cheap thrills that made Jaws so daring and revolutionary, while smuggling in ethical quandaries about the darker side of scientific discovery. On a related note, those in the know, no doubt have heard about the mammoth they're planning on cloning. Regardless of the hardships experienced by the characters of Jurassic Park, who isn't excited to see something like that?http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com","

"jameslinton-75252","10 May 2016","I recently finished reading the novel and I thought that I would watch and review the film to see how the two compared. I think that the film was paced a lot more evenly. It cut out a lot of the novel's clunky exposition and development. The supporting cast were also great from Wayne Knight as the corrupt Denis Nedry to Samuel L. Jackson as Ray Arnold. The film balanced the scientific and action segments. Never at any point did it feel like one dominated the other. I also much preferred the film's presentation of John Hammond. Now only if the dinosaurs had eaten those annoying as hell kids.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/dM0Llf","

"seamaso","9 August 2002","It still baffles me why this brilliant movie isn't in the top 250 movies for IMDB! it's amazing! I think this is the kind of film that people take too seriously and don't see the obvious reasons what make this such a great movie.  For one such as ""Jurassic Park"" it represents everything a summer blockbuster should be, (and why Spielberg is the king of 'blockbuster summer' movies).In all fairness, a film like this is only worth watching for the special effects (which still remain top-notch).  It is a dinosaur movie- it does exactly what it says on the tin- it thrills and amazes and never lets up, it is perfect popcorn fare and not since ""Jaws"" (the first proper summer blockbuster!) has a film so brilliantly had such an affect on movies which were to follow. Essentially it is ""Jaws"" on-land and it does so perfectly, with great pace great set-pieces.  I wish this film was in the top 250, if any movie deserves it , ""Jurassic Park"" does, not just for being such a great film but also for revolutionising films from there on out!!Brilliant!!!","

"robobalboa","16 April 2022","It's always hilarious to me how adult this movie is. Not like, sexy, but just mature. Like, how was I supposed to engage with the first hour of this movie as a four year-old?Most of it is conversations about ethics, chaos theory, biology and corporate malfeasance.I still think of this as a family friendly monster movie - brought to us by the incredible imagination of Spielberg, the most sentimental and populist filmmaker of all-time, helming a rip-roaring adventure with dinosaurs!And yeah it's that, for a bit, but half it's runtime is dedicated to grown-ups just being grumpy, or untrusting, or horny.My mom still brings it up, but apparently when I was a kid the only thing I wanted for Christmas was the Jurassic Park play set, all I did was talk about it, made a big deal out of it when I saw the commercials- totally bowled over by the marketing campaign. When I got the toy set, all I really wanted to play with was the dinosaurs. I mean, what kid is like ""Awesome I got the Laura Dern and Sam Neill figures - and the computer lab!"" They were just dorks in khakis, I could have a velociraptor fight Wolverine, and they didn't have to be in a visitor center to do it.I saw this in 93 in theaters (or so I'm told) and I saw it again in theaters in 2013 when they released it in 3D, and honestly, I hope they release it again in 2023, maybe in smell-o-vision, who knows, could be fun.","

When the movie was made, I was 7 years old, and until the present days (2005) I think it is a fascinating film,who deserved more then the 3 Oscars won. I love the special effects, who makes all the dinosaurs looks so real and close to us, humans. Sam Neill is so impeccable as professor Alan and Jeff Goldblum is great too. I can say that I started to be more interested about the dinosaurs after this film,reading about some of them in some books and websites. Other thing very important about this movie, is to think about cloning and the consequences behind of it; I mean,one of the news I read those days, was about some scientists that found the corpse of a mammoth in a good state and already think about cloning it. Looks that we need to pay more attention in Jurassic Park's warnings.","

Wow!Sure there are flaws in logic here and there, but I expect that from Spielberg. In his blockbusters he always puts the fun of the movie ahead of the logic of the movie, but always in a way that doesn't betray the other parts of the film which make it fun. This is what makes him the master.There are directors with higher box office totals, more awards, and higher rotten tomatoes ratings, but none of them create the holistic works that Spielberg does. His blockbusters have something for everyone without leaving anyone feeling like they were paid lip service and frustrated.","

"AngelHonesty","4 January 2022","One of the greatest films ever made. Everything about this movie is brilliant, from beginning to end. When someone thinks about watching a movie about dinosaurs, this movie is always at the top of the list. Not only because the film did an amazing job with presenting the dinosaurs to the viewer, but because it shows how dangerous and magnificent they are. The best part about the entire movie is that every scene when they have the dinosaurs doing a close up with the humans, they look sooo real because they used mechanical dinosaurs. The scenes put chills through the viewer with how powerful they are. The only downfall to the movie is the CGi scenes. For it's day the CGI was amazing and even today, it isn't over the top bad or super cringe worthy, but it is noticeable. The cinematography is breath taking and the acting and lines are all good. A must see for any movie lover.","

"eamon-hennedy","11 June 2003","This is a film that has truly stood the test of time and has remained a modern classic of the Hollywood blockbuster system. Deservedly becoming the biggest film of all time in 1993 and launching the most entertaining film series ever made, Spielberg's film contains all the cliches a blockbuster should have and ensures that it remains good fun. We have the courageous scientist in the shape of Sam Niell, his fiesty girlfriend courtesy of Laura Dern, a doom and gloom expert in the causes of the problem at hand thanks to a brilliant performance from Bob Peck and the quirky scientist type who prophesises doom from the get go in the shape of Jeff Goldblum. This is fun and has remained so for the last ten years.Where the film has remained so good over the past decade is in its use of CGI and at the time state of the art special effects. They still haven't dated and look fluidly real as if the technology had only been made yesterday. Undoubtedly the dinosaurs are the star here (none of the actors have headlined each film with a change of performer for each one, Goldblum in the second installment, Niell returning for number three), but it doesn't matter because the dinosaurs here are truly movie stars in their own right and like characters in an ensemble film they all get their moments. The T-Rex gets to cause spectacular destruction, the Raptors get to be the vicious and conniving villains of the story, the Brachiosaurus ensures it grabs our awe while the Tricerotops gains our sympathy.However, Spielberg ensures that it isn't just the dinosaurs who are the stars here. He creates tension in the way that only he can with prolonged set pieces such as the T-Rex attack and the moment Alan and Tim have to race down a tree with the threat of a car falling on top of them. Sure it ain't art, it's great entertainment and it is great fun and it here where Spielberg ensures the film classic status. He uses the two hour frame to set up events and the story in the first hour and then let the chaos rip in the second with suspenseful action sequence after suspenseful action sequence and it works. While you may not look to performances in a film like this, it does have some fantastic actors. Niell seems surprisingly well suited to being a Spielbergian hero who starts of disliking children only to have his heart melted at the end. He appears to be having great fun playing the guy who saves the day. Jeff Goldblum almost runs away with the entire film as Malcolm, the quirky off beat nature of the character ensuring many a great one liner while Richard Attenborough is heart breaking as the Walt Disney like John Hammond whose dream becomes a violent nightmare.The film is great fun from beginning to end and deserves to be up there with Jaws and King Kong as one of the all time great monster movies.","

"bombersflyup","8 June 2021","Jurassic Park is a universally great and momentous family-film and an awe-inspiring experience.It's really more than that as well, as they sort of did bring back dinosaurs in a way, as interest in the subject flourished. With a class cast and excellent characters, as you can expect with Spielberg films, along with a quality score. Wayne Knight's performance is one I'm particularly fond of, as well as Jackson and Attenborough's reactions to his character.","

"kevin_robbins","10 July 2022","Jurassic Park (1993) is a movie in my DVD collection that my daughter and I recently rewatched together on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a pair of archeologists brought in to see the world's first ever man made dinosaurs created from fossilized DNA of prehistoric dinosaurs. The financial backer of the science wants to create a theme park for the dinosaurs for people to see his creations. As the scientists partake in the first dry run of the park they quickly discover dinosaurs cannot be contained so easily...This movie is directed by Steven Spielberg (ET) and stars Sam Neill (In the Mouth of Madness), Jeff Goldblum (The Fly), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), Laura Dern (Blue Velvet), Wayne Knight (Seinfeld) and Ariana Richards (Tremors).The background music from the opening to closing credits is absolutely perfect in this movie. You feel the intensity of every scene from the music in the background and wonderfully created tremors elements anytime a dinosaur is present. The cast is relatable across the board and Knight played the perfect ""villain."" The special effects in this are magic as is the delivery of the science on how this could be possible. The concept really feels believable. Also incorporating people getting killed by dinosaurs was brilliant as was unleashing the raptor species into the world like we had never seen before was well done. There's nothing not to love about this movie. This is an easy 10/10 and an absolute must see.","

"ferguson-6","8 April 2013","There are a few truly awe-inspiring moments in movie history. One of the most memorable occurs when Dorothy steps out of her Black & White farm house and into the full color wonderland of Oz. Not far behind is our first glimpse of the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. Director Steven Spielberg brilliantly focused on the stunned reactions of Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Attler (Laura Dern). We smiled because we knew their reactions mirrored ours! Now, twenty years later, the film has been re-released with a very effective 3D re-mastering.The movie has its place in Hollywood history for its revolutionary use of George Lucas' ILM CGI and the animatronics and visual effects under the supervision of Ray Winston. This was no ordinary science fiction special-effects movie. It was a very interesting, entertaining, thrilling story that brought to life the plastic dinosaur toys of kids and dinosaur dreams of curious adults. This was light years from the Ray Harryhausen stop-action dinosaurs we had seen before. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park had back-stories, childhoods, ferocious roars and a realistic look that tied right into our childhood fantasies.Never-before-seen special effects would be enough to set this one apart, but it's the story and characters that draw us in and elevate the movie to classic status. John Hammond is a very likable, little old rich man played by Sir Richard Attenborough. In fact, Attenborough is genuinely such a nice guy, he was cast as Kris Kringle in the 1994 re-make of Miracle on 34th Street. He is also an Oscar winning director for Gandhi (1982) and ironically beat out Spielberg (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) that year. Attenborough also directed A Bridge Too Far (1973), A Chorus Line (1985) and Chaplin (1992); plus, one of my favorite hidden gems: Magic (1978). Unfortunately, Attenborough, now almost 90 years old, has recently been moved into hospice for health reasons.John Hammond and his team of scientists have taken ""dino DNA"" and brought life to dinosaurs, previously 65 million years extinct. Hammonds' instincts as a showman lead him to develop a kind of amusement park where people can come and see his dinosaur creations in a natural habitat. Facing a lawsuit  what could go wrong??  his investors bring in a team of specialists to inspect the park. Dr. Grant, Dr. Attler and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) take the tour with Hammond's grandchildren (Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards) and a bean counter played by Martin Ferrero. Of course, things go terribly wrong thanks to a sub-plot involving the park's computer guru played by Wayne Knight (Newman from ""Seinfeld""). Don't miss the photo of J Robert Oppenheimer (the atomic bomb creator) on Nedry's computer monitor. Samuel L Jackson has a classic line of dialogue, but also seems to be prepping for his role in Deep Blue Sea (1999). The other key player is the park's game warden played terrifically by the late Bob Peck  he mutters the ""clever girl"" line.Real life Paleontoligist Jack Horner worked as an adviser on the film and was the inspiration for the Dr. Grant character. It's also interesting to note that there was quite a bidding war for the rights  even before writer Michael Crichton had finished the manuscript. When Spielberg won the rights, he hired Crichton to write the screenplay, and David Koepp was brought in for the final version. Crichton is also known for Westworld (1973), Twister (1996) and The Andromeda Strain (1971). Mr. Koepp is known for his screenplays that include Mission Impossible (1996), Panic Room (2002) and Spider-Man (2002). And of course, the majestic score was composed by the great John Williams, a frequent Spielberg collaborator. Jurassic Park was nominated for and won three Oscars: Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. Many believe Jurassic Park should have nominated for the Best Picture, but I doubt Mr. Spielberg much cares. See, he released another movie that same year  Schindler's List did win the Best Picture Oscar. Many ask about the child actors from Jurassic Park. Tim was played by Joseph Mazzello, who was most recently seen in TV's ""Justified"", as the snake-charming traveling preacher. Mr. Mazzello has also appeared in The Social Network, and the mini-series ""The Pacific"". Lexi was played by Ariana Richards and she won the role based on her amazing ability to show and express fear  and her believability as a teenage hacker. Ms. Richards has focused more on her work as an artist, but does act periodically.Jurassic Park is definitely one to experience on the biggest screen possible with the clearest sound possible. This 3D re-mastering is worth the price of admission and I enjoyed seeing the look of awe in the eyes of a few youngsters in the theatre. No need to wait for Jurassic Park 4, which is scheduled for release in 2014  go experience the original in its full big screen glory!","

"PCC0921","18 January 2022","Jurassic Park (1993), became a phenomenon, because of its director, Steven Spielberg. Also, the source material, from a novel of the same name, by Michael Crichton, is adapted to screen so well, because of the advances in CGI technology, that debuted around this time. It's also to note, that the performances of the excellent cast completely help sell the tension, fear and unknown, that the characters have to face.The film is full of action, in-between a dazzling story about, man tampering with nature, trying to play God. It is a concept that goes all the way back to Mary Shelley. In this case, tampering with DNA, by successfully cloning dinosaurs and letting them live in the middle of a theme park. You then add in Spielberg-faithful, John Williams, majestic trumpets and you have a perfect film. This film tends to appeal to a wide range of audiences. It doesn't just, tickle the heck, out of science fiction fans. It is enjoyed by many. That is what makes it the mot special, because it is something everyone can enjoy.Jurassic Park (1993), played a huge role in film history, as being one of the earliest films to influence the arrival of digital CGI effects. You see all the pioneers, of the modern age of effects, starting in the mid-90s. It is because of films like this, is why we now enjoy these beautiful, CGI heavy, fantasy films of today. Steven Spielberg, was already a household name by the time we got to here. This film just firmly cemented him in a place in history, where generations will know his work.9.7 (A+ MyGrade) = 10 IMDB.","

"neil-476","23 July 2010","Growing up, Ray Harryhausen was my movie hero - he specialised in putting on screen things which didn't exist. For the last 35 years his place has been taken by Stephen Spielberg, simply because he makes such very, very good films. And he has been known to put something impossible on screen every now and then, too.To synopsise, a theme park is set up on an island, populated by dinosaurs reconstructed from prehistoric DNA extracted from mosquitoes preserved in amber. During the ""test drive"" of the park, attended by palaeontologists, things go horribly wrong...Michael Crichton's book, though very enjoyable, is filled to overflowing with technobabble, particularly with regard to the park's computer system. And, if one is brutally honest, it recycles the basic idea of Crichton's own Westworld some 20 years earlier, albeit different theme park, different victims.Spielberg strips away, simplifies, gives us a range of very human humans as potential (and actual!) victims, and a moderate amount of exposition so that we always believe what happens, and then sets off on the first of a number of spectacular set pieces. The story is minimal and almost incidental.The cast are all good. Jeff Goldblum is not always to my taste, but Sam Neill's sincerity and dignity compensates. But this movie is never about the cast, nor the story.The dinosaurs (and their integration into the movie) are nearly flawless - there are one or two points where the gallimimuses don't convince 100% that they belong against that particular background plate. They vary between mechanical/animatronic effects and CGI - and this is quite near that dawn of CGI for photo-realistic characters wholly integrated into movies - and it was impossible to distinguish which shots are physical and which are photographic. If you don't believe how truly remarkable Jurassic Park's dinosaurs were, particularly for their day, try comparing them with any CGI monster from the SciFi channel's specially commissioned movies nearly 20 years later, and see how unconvincing CGI critters can be, and how woefully they can be integrated into backgrounds (or, indeed, NOT integrated!). They stand up as well now as they did when the movie was first released and, given how far CGI has come since then, that is a testament to their quality.If I had a criticism, it would be that the film is rather too leisurely in dealing with the set up - with the benefit of hindsight, the disastrous events of the second half of the film could have started a little earlier. However, this is more than made up for by John Williams' wonderful score.Addition: April 2013 The recent 3D conversion is quite superb: you would never know that the movie was filmed flat.","

"smashattack","11 December 2001","Jurassic Park really is 65 million years in the making. I mean, wow. I have never seen a movie that combines action/adventure, intellectuality, in-depth characters, excellent storyline, great graphics, and perhaps one of the best soundtracks ever made (John Williams, of course) in one movie.  How the makers of this movie fit all this really baffles me. What else really amazes me is how close the movie was to the book (especially compared to other books made into movies by Crichton).  Don't let that statement fool you; Jurassic Park the movie is nowhere near the book, but the essential parts have not been ripped out of the book (like all of Crichton's books). Michael Crichton, John Williams, and Steven Spielberg--what an excellent combination!  Crichton wrote the awesome book (and the screenplay for the movie, too, I think), Williams composed and conducted some of the best contemporary/thriller music ever made, and Spielberg made the frightening dinosaurs so much more freaky. The only thing wrong with it was that it wasn't as close to the book as I'd hoped, although, like I said earlier, it maintained the essential parts, which is unusual in Crichton's book-to-movie transformations.  The book explained things a lot better and I could really connect with the book a little better.  I can connect with the movie, too, it's just that I needed to watch it several times before I understood exactly how everything happened the way it did. Watch this movie.  It has hardly any disappointment in it, if any.","

"Mr-Fusion","16 June 2015","Part of me wonders if this movie would've had such an impact on me were I just a bit older back in 1993. At its heart, ""Jurassic Park"" is really just a monster movie, but it rides high on Spielberg as the master showman; it plays like an amusement park full of impressive effects and plenty of scares. In one scene, he takes the vibe from wonder to dead to horror, and I still appreciate that as a much older adult; same for the CGI, which is used perfectly as a tool (and still holds up for that reason). I can't say whether the science is accurate (though I still think it's cool), but the thrills deliver and the cast is good (letting the smartass Goldblum steal every scene). There's a reason why ""Jurassic Park"" owned the Summer of '93 and it's right there on the screen. 8/10","

Well how about this: The CGI shows it's age now but it is impressive that it held up for as long as it did. And yeah, this was inevitable but it's still sad to see.My favorite moment is when the Raptor sticks his head out of the cables. (I miss when the Raptors were terrifying. Good times.)It's not flawless, it has some pretty big problems. There are holes in the story, it's got its inconsistencies, dumb stuff, and a lot of cheese but the pros vastly outweigh the cons.","

"bheadher","24 October 2015","When I sat down in the theater seat I had no idea what to expect. I hadn't seen a big screen movie in a long time, but I'm glad I saw this one the first time there. I'd have to say Jurassic Park was brilliantly executed from start to finish, with absolutely outstanding CGI blended in with some very stunning acting. I'm kind of a science follower anyway, so when they incorporated some sound scientific elements into the story, it sort of added to an almost perfect story. Don't believe you could ""genetically engineer some dinosaurs??? While there are two conflicted camps in the Genetics realm, there is generally agreement that it is possible. It would simply be very difficult to create the right genetic conditions, then you wouldn't quite know what you had until the animal hatched. So yes, the apparent ease of manipulation you see in Jurassic Park is a bit over the top, which is one of the reasons I only gave it a 9. The other reason is that about half the dinosaurs depicted in the movie were from totally different time periods. The Brachiosaurus is about the only truly large dinosaur that was firmly entrenched in the Jurassic period. There were a couple other plant eaters that were really huge also, but no large carnivores. The majority in the movie belonged in the Cretaceuos period.Oh well, it was and still is the leader in movies that bring dinosaurs to life!","

"FiendishDramaturgy","30 September 2003","This movie has every known ingredient for a long-running, well-loved, top money-making cinematic success: a deeply developed, lovable cast of characters; a creatively written and very well developed script; sound, believable dialog; totally realistic, imaginative effects; an awe-inspiring soundtrack; superb direction; good, solid, workable CGI creations; wonderful sets which inspire the imagination; and an excellent group of professional, lovable actors.The first time I saw this movie, I was in absolute awe of the dinosaurs. I could not believe how well they were done. I felt like I was right there, in that clearing with Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler, seeing them live, for the first time. I was actually...moved.I must admit that I have not always loved everything Spielberg has directed, but this is definitely one of my all-time favorites. It inspires the imagination, boggles the mind, and teases the child in all of us with the wonderful creation of these magnificent creatures. In this Fiend's opinion, ILM is the very best effects company there is. I admire their founder, and the visual images they create, and these creations were certainly no exception.Plot: InGen has created clones of many species of extinct dinosaurs in an attempt to engineer the world's first dinosaur theme park ergo the movie's title, ""Jurassic Park."" In order to obtain approval from the investors for the park's opening, Hammond, the CEO, has to solicit the nod from a diverse team of outside experts. Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), accompanied by the ""blood-sucking"" lawyer representing the board of investigators and Hammond's own grandchildren, take the official ""tour"" of Jurassic Park, but nothing seems to go right.""So...eventually you're going to have DINOSAURS on your dinosaur tour? Right? Yes? Hello?"" Ian Malcolm.""I do HATE that man!"" John Hammond.Then, something goes decidedly wrong! Sabotaged by one of his own family, Hammond's security is down, and the electrified fences containing these creations is turned off. Before anyone can get them back online, chaos commences. But the party of experts, Hammond's grandchildren and the lawyer are caught behind enemy lines.The question now, is no longer will they endorse it, but will they survive Jurassic Park? I absolutely LOVE this movie. The close-ups of the details created by ILM on the dinosaurs were absolutely wonderful, believable and outright realistic.As far as adaptations go Michael Crichton wrote the screenplay himself, so regardless of my personal feelings, I accept the story to be as close as was workable to the original literary work, though it felt heavily like a ""Westworld"" remake...with dinosaurs.It earns a 9.1/10 for actually making it feel real, from...the Fiend :.","

"Theo Robertson","1 June 2004","JURASSIC PARK was released with a massive publicity campaign and went on to make a massive profit at the box office and unlike the majority of over hyped blockbusters ( Hello Harry Potter ) this movie deserved every cent it made from cinema goers . There`s only two things I can criticise
1 ) I have no idea where John Hammond comes from but it`s not Scotland . Strangely enough Richard Attenborough has a holiday cottage on the Isle Of Bute . If he needed a voice coach to master a Scottish accent all he had to do was ask me 2 ) A big game hunter . Forgive me for asking but hasn`t it been illegal to go around shooting elephants and lions and tigers for many , many years ? Shouldn`t this great white hunter be aged about 80 years old
I* can forgive the above because this is top notch entertainment with absolutely flawless technical aspects and most of it was achieved via CGI . Strange that the computer generated images of this 1993 movie are far better than the effects of latter movies , compare it with all these Stephen Sommer movies to see what I mean . Perhaps it`s also a good idea to compare them with all those old movies whose dinosaur effects are done by sticking a fin on a lizard There is a very one very thoughtful scene amongst all the lizard excitement and that`s the scene where Henry Wu explains the process of how scientists have resurrected dinosuars . It`s a beautifully written , beautifully acted scene that in the context of the story is the greatest success in the history of human science , greater than even going to the moon and back again . It would be very easy - And very careless - for the movie makers to forget what the scientific endeavour involves but here Spielberg reminds both the characters and the audience that even the most blase scientist should feel pride in bringing back a species of animal extinct for many millions of years . It`s this scene that stops JURASSIC PARK being just another FX laden Summer blockbuster and lends credibility to an already exciting story","

This movie has great characters and a simple story. The direction of the story is executed so well, that you don't care of the minor flaws. The visual effects, over 20 years later still looks better than most stuff today. This is becuase of the anachronistic used in close up shots and cgi used in wide shots or over the head shots. Any time the camera was placed far away from the dinasor was CGI. The two blend well together, givin this sense of disbelief.","

"tieman64","24 July 2008","""There is no unauthorised breeding in Jurassic Park."" - Dr. Woo ""Jurassic Park"" has been compared to ""Jaws"" (""Jaws"" was actually a rip-off of ""Creature From The Black Lagoon"", down to the stealing of the ""duh duh duh"" soundtrack and several scenes, shot for shot) but thematically it's actually the opposite. Michael Crichton's ""Jurassic Park"" is based upon an earlier film which he wrote called ""Westworld"", in which an amusement park's stable of robots escaped their planned systems of control and murdered all the park's visitors.While ""Westworld"" dealt with cybernetics, ""Jurassic Park"" takes genetic engineering and develops it within the context of 2 contrasting world views. Crichton takes the classical scientific notion of a mechanistic universe, in which everything is predictable and subject to physical laws, and plays it off against the newly emerging dynamical systems theory, also known as Chaos theory.In Crichton's book, the mechanistic view comes off as an inadequate strategy of approaching the living world, which is constantly moving, in flux and widely unpredictable. According to Chaos theory, the world is a shifting pattern of processes and vibrations, all interlaced to form a complex mosaic of nature in which figures can't be isolated or removed. The dinosaurs of ""Jurassic Park"" are genetic reconstructions of species which have already been removed from the global environment. Crichton's book contrasts the mechanistic world of the scientists - their technology, computers, predictions and simulations - with the raw force of nature, wild and ever adapting. His characters keep trying to predict and cater for the beasts, but their computers simply don't have the brainpower to foresee what will happen next. The plot's essentially an update of Shelley's ""Frankenstein""; Nature and Science too complex for the arrogant hands of man.Spielberg's film is mostly devoid of all this stuff, and instead plays like a straightforward adventure movie. It's a cross between ""Frankenstein"" and ""King Kong"", with several iconic action set pieces and some memorable CGI work sprinkled about.Note that Spielberg ends the film just as Melville ends ""Moby Dick"", the crash of the T-Rex's tail echoing the crash of the whale as it destroys Ahab's ship. Both the Melville and Crichton stories are a direct contrast to ""Jaws"", which was a classical dragon slayer story in which our hero slays the monster and emerges triumphant. In ""Jurassic Park"" it is nature who wins, and the humans are forced to flee the island. In ""Jaws"", the humans conquer nature, tame it, and claim the beaches for themselves.The dragon slayer myth (""Jaws"") is the underlying myth of the mechanistic view of the universe. It spans across folk like Descartes and Francis Bacon, who saw ""science"" and ""man"" as ""masculinizing"" forces who tame a feminized nature with the awesome ""laws"" of man. ""Jurrasic Park"", however, is the opposite, and shows what happens when such a mechanistic view of nature serves as the basis for removing a particular species from their environment as though they were mere atoms.Less talked about are the film's weird gender games and visual gags. Perhaps the best (you have to read the books to get this joke) is a moment of foreshadowing which occurs early on, when a nervous Dr. Grant struggles to connect two female seat belt couplings. The park's dinosaurs have similarly been neutered, yet, as Grant later shows by tying two identical seat-belt parts together, nature always finds a way. Significantly, while men wreak and receive havoc, no females are killed in the film. Ellie, the film's female human hero, even jokes about God making man, man making dinosaurs, dinosaurs eating man and women inheriting the earth. While a joke, it signals to the viewer just who actually controls creation in the film. Men and science may have co-opted the process, but women/Nature still remain the ultimate power in creative process. Like ""Aliens"", you then have an alignment of the beasts, the dinosaurs, with an unhinged Femininity, and a wild, feminine Nature. In this way the film goes on to perpetuate a very 17th century form of sexism and gender bias: Man is lord of the realm of order, control and science, while woman - in her strangeness, her mystery - is mistress of calamity, destruction and the wilderness, the jungle and womb conflated. Unlike ""Aliens"", though, Spielberg has his Queens survive with roars of triumph. The men leave with their tails between their legs8/10 - Spielberg essentially reduced a complex and interesting techno-thriller into another Indiana Jones movie (Sam Niel even resembles Dr Jones). It's very lightweight, and Spielberg's dinosaur attacks are crass, but the film's also slick and exciting at times.After ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters"", Spielberg's ""popcorn"" films got increasingly cartoonish. The fully fleshed characters of his earlier thrillers (Martin Brody, Roy Neary etc) are replaced with cardboard heroes. Spielberg's justification, I suspect, is that he now began making ""serious"" pictures which he feels better warrant depth and characterisation. Worth multiple viewings.","

"dorMancyx","14 September 2021","In my opinion, the Jurassic Park is the perfect model of commercial film itself: creative, bold, and mesmerizing. Even rewatching it in the 21st century, the structure of the story is undebatable in any ways, whether characters, plot, and the role of dinosaurs themselves. Just pick any part of the movie and you'll find breathtaking events and inspirations to myriad future sci-fi movies. Except for the slightly outdated CGI presentation, Jurassic Park is spotless.","

"sandnair87","26 April 2015","The focus of Steven Spielberg's ground-breaking thrill-ride Jurassic Park, is a wondrous island theme park off the coast of Costa Rica populated by genetically engineered dinosaurs, masterminded by billionaire visionary John Hammond (a superlative Richard Attenborough), ready for business as soon as a handful of experts can declare it legally and naturally safe for paying customers. Soon we see a group of scientists head to Isla Nublar including paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his paleobotanist colleague Ellie Satler (Laura Dern), and mathematician Ian Malcolm (a fast- talking, vintage Jeff Goldblum), a chaos theorist who recognizes that knowledge without discipline equals disaster. Of course he's right, and the park's maiden tour turns into a nightmare for the visitors, who include Hammond's two precocious grandchildren. Compounding this mayhem is the park's systems-control expert, who plots to sell dinosaur DNA to a rival corporation, and must sabotage park security to carry out his scheme. When a tropical storm threatens the island, our unscrupulous employee seizes the opportunity, leaving the billion-dollar attractions to roam free, as all hell breaks loose. What ensues is special-effects nirvana!Jurassic Park is an astonishing success in one sense and one sense only: It is the monster of all monster movies, guaranteed to challenge weak bladders and flutter heartbeats with its astounding full-size live-action mechanics and computer-generated imagery. But more than anything, it is Spielberg's pop culture wizardry that sells Jurassic Park. He retains a child-like glee in making us jump while giving flesh and blood characters the fright of their lives, with every mind-boggling moment of wonder and terror - from the gentle gracefulness of a gigantic Brachiosaurus walking across a green pasture to the horrifying attack of a T-Rex during a rainstorm to the first appearance of the dreaded Velociraptors. Spielberg orchestrates the action with effortless verve and, only the most Scrooge-like viewer will fail to be transfixed by the thrilling action and the sheer scale of the director's vision. T-Rex and his chums are indisputably the stars here but Jurassic Park is still a very character-driven movie, and part of what makes the film so successful is Spielberg's insistence that the dinosaurs may overrun the park, but never the film. Every character has something to do, and they are the focus of every scene with all actors pitching in commendable performances.Jurassic Park exists now as one of the pinnacles of popcorn cinema - a terrific thrill ride that is more than just the sum of its special effects. It may be easy to look at Jurassic Park as of a bygone era, but no rose-colored glasses or nostalgic impulses are needed to remain in astonishment at what Spielberg was able to create. It remains as potent an entertainment as ever - a watershed moment in cinematic history!","

Jurassic Park is perhaps the best book to film ever made and one of the best creature features ever made, actually it is the best. Jurassic Park was a one of a kind film in ti's day it had amazing CGI and truly mind blowing automated prosthetic dinosaurs.Jurassic Park stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Wayne Knight and Samuel L. Jackson. as a group of people who are invited and who work on an island called Isla Nublar, no one knows what it is and for five years a man named John Hammond has been setting up a sort of biological preserve off the coast of Costa Rica, but this preserve is much different than any other it doesn't house animals it houses dinosaurs, a species of creatures not seen for over 5,000 years. now a group of scientist have the great opportunity to see these amazing creatures before anyone else, but in the blink of an eye this amazing experience turns into a swift rampaging nightmare that unleashes an awesome fury the likes the world has never seen before. Now theses scientist have to out run some of the most deadly predators the world has ever know. Jurassic Park is a high tech pulse racing, mind blowing and eyeball freezing adventure that won't let up till the very end. I very,very highly recommended this amazing film. I hope my thoughts helps~C.R. Lopez 2/4/2009","

"taylorkingston","8 June 2015","I love this movie. It's so amazing. It's funny, it's scary at times, it's adventures and I just love the idea of dinosaurs in the present world. The cast do a great job with their characters. I almost feel like this movie is real, it's done that well.On an island, a man has brought back dinosaurs, by using DNA extracted from a mosquito. He plans to open a theme park, where people from around the world can come and enjoy the previously extinct creatures. But Jurassic Park won't happen as easy as he would have hoped. Dinosaurs get loose, people get hurt and die, and no one is safe from the T-Rex or the velosoraptor (don't know how to spell it).Best part of the movie: The car scene with the T-Rex.Worst part of the movie: The girl's scream.Recommended for: EveryoneOverall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing.","

It was a flea circus...Petticoat Lane. It was quite spectacular. Spared no expense. There was a miniature merry-go-round and a wee trapeze and a car-carousel... and a see-saw. They all moved, motorised of course, but people would say they could see the fleas. ""Oh, I can see the fleas, mummy, can't you see the fleas?"" Clown fleas and high-wire fleas and fleas on parade. But this place..... I wanted to show them something they could see... and touch. an aim Not devoid of merit. The direction is spot on and so scary I can't not get scared of the dinosaurs I also love the first 20 minutes when everything is set up and the Mr DNA cartoon I really think it is the best aspect of the film for children and really educational I think the film is best enjoyed by children it is a fantastic family film despite the fact of the scary segments which are very few and far between The dinosaur's effects are mind blowing cinematic achievements Thanks to Industrial Light and Magic for their cinematic achievements and well done Michael Kahn for superb editing work the beginning 20 minutes and ending 20 to 25 minutes are outstanding examples of how to edit a film the End Credits music is outstanding and the ending scene is so perfect and the last line is perfection wonderful and perfect for the tone of the film too I think Mr. Hammond, after careful consideration, I've decided not to endorse your park. So have I. and the climatic roar of the t rex and then the film ends with the end credits music with everyone is reflecting no dialogue just John Williams's music that's it just score beautiful simple but effective piano almost like a memory for John Hammond and the visitors That is All I can say without giving anything away Just experience this action adventure masterpiece for yourself you will see what all the fuss is about Life will find a way!","

"happipuppi13","27 June 2022","In early 1994, a few months after this had been out, I decided
to finally see what all the fuss was about and I'm glad I did.I already knew that during the course of this film I'd see dinosaurs on the loose and attacking. What I did not know or expect was the amazingly real looking beasts that emerged on-screen.It speaks volumes for a movie and special effects when at age 25, my jaw literally dropped and my eyes got wide when the dinosaurs appeared! Computer effects may be the norm now but in 1993 / 1994 it was just the most incredible thing I ever had seen on the big screen in special effects.I was actually jumping when the dinosaurs roared, jumped out suddenly and (ugh) ate somebody. (I had to close my eyes on that last one.)In terms of the acting from everyone here, I feel it's just right for this kind of movie. In the 1950s, there were monster movies at theaters all the time and the acting in those (at that time) it was enough to make the audience scared on their own and for the characters as well.We now find the old monster movies 'amusing' but still enjoy them. Here, it's no different. Stop and think, how would you react if you were suddenly in a place and surrounded by carnivorous Dinosaurs? You'd freak out of course but hopefully you'd go into survival mode.I feel everyone here had the proper reactions and since
this is a high level monster movie. They did a vedry fine job.In agreeing with many here ....
this was fantastic. 10 Stars then and now. (END)","

"Terryfan","9 June 2015","Jurassic Park, a movie that has been apart of my childhood and I have seen it in theaters along with seeing it in 3D for the 20th Anniversary. Jurassic Park was directed by Steven Spielberg who was inspired by the book of the same name written by Michael Crichton. What makes Jurassic Park such a milestone in motion pictures is the fact that the film is the first one to bring Dinosaurs to the screen with creditable mix of pushing C.G.I. to the limit and using Stan Wilson's Studios animatronics work and to this day the effects are superb and the Dinosaurs look very much alive in the film they did a great job bringing these creatures to the screenJurassic Park still reminds one of my favorite films even today because it's one of those films that are masterpieces and being I love Dinosaurs as a kid it was just perfectThe plot of the film centers around Paleontologist Dr.Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr.Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) get involved by John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to his theme park off the coast of Costa Rica where he owns a island Isla Nublar Along Dr.Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldbulm) and Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to visit his theme park he calls Jurassic Park where they have cloned Dinosaurs and brought them back to life. After an accident where an worker was killed they asked to give their opinions on the park to keep the investors at ease. They are later join by John's grandchildren Lex and Tim Murphy (Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello).Along with these characters we are also introduce to Ray Arnold (Samuel L.Jackson) who helps run the parks computer systems with Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) and Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck)Just when it seem everything was going as plan the power suddenly begins to fall in the park leaving the fences to the dinosaurs to be shut down letting the dinosaurs free and the visitors fighting for their lives.The plot of the film does feature some from the novel but it is pretty much original from the story that was written and it worked like a charm with the story being a story driven action thriller that has kept viewers on the edge of their seats each time they watch it. From the story to the climax of the film you are given a thrill ride and story driven film.The Dinosaurs feature in the film are Tyrannosaurus Rex,Velociraptors, Triceratops, Parasaurolophus, Brachiosaurus, Dilophosaurus, and Gallimimus they are detail to make them look and feel like real Dinosaurs it still a beautiful piece of art to see how well they give these animals justice and gave movie fans a wonderful look into how these animals might have been in the past. Real and C.G.I. The Dinosaurs are just amazing to watch on screen. The movie brought something for everyone from thriller action scenes to moments that made your heart race the film deliver on so many levels with the infamous Break out Scene of the T-Rex to the Raptors in the kitchen Jurassic Park has created some of the greatest moments in movie history that leaves you on the edge of your seat at the same time be in awe by the film's impressive work of art.The cast worked very well together to bring the story to life and they pick the right stars for these roles, Sam, Laura, Jeff, Richard and everyone made the character memorable along with classic lines from the film like ""Welcome To Jurassic Park"" ""Hold onto your Butts"" ""Ah ah ah you didn't say the magic word"" Music in Jurassic Park is just phenomenal with Mr.John Williams doing the score for the film anything he touches with his music turns to gold his music is like listening to a story and it just beautiful. Every piece of music he wrote for this film is masterpiece in their own right such as ""Welcome To Jurassic Park"" ""Dennis steals the embryos"" ""Remembering Petticoat Lane"" ""A Tree for my bed"" the music just fits the film perfectly.I can't find nothing bad to say about Jurassic Park it is just one of the greatest films ever created and one I can watch over and over still love it. It's just one of those films you can't help but respect. I give Jurassic Park an perfect 10 out of 10Welcome To Jurassic Park","

"amiranda-39274","13 July 2020","This is the movie i have probably seen more times than any other movie. I just watched this movie again with family, and i watched the documentary on the making of this film "" Return to Jurrassic Park"", and i then went on a jurrassic park binge reading all trivia i could find, and now i feel I'm ready to finally do a review on this movie. Honestly i don't think i can say anything that hasn't already been said in every single review on this site, its that ingrained in peoples lives. This movie is truly magical, so magical that everyone who sees it, is enchanted by it, and if they say differently their lying. I have a different problem, I am completely obsessed with this movie and story, so much that i consider this movie, my #1 movie! For a movie buff who has probably seen over a million movies and shows, that is a grandiose statement for me to say. Here are my reasons why.The story: The talented Michael crichton wrote the equally impressive novel of this movie, that was such an impressive story that universal studios bought the rights to the story before it was even published, and immediately started on production for the movie . If you don't already know, the plot of the movie is about a eccentric billionaire who wants to bring dinos back to life, and make a theme park where everybody can come see them, but he needs the opinions from scientific experts to give him the okay to open up, while on their tour of the park, of course everything goes terribly wrong. The story can be seen as just a game of tag and not getting eaten, but its so much more than that. Its a story about respecting nature, creating trust and friendship with each other, and reviving the child in you. Every single scene in this movie is important to me, and is essential in constructing the magic of this movie.The Characters: This movie has so many wonderful characters, that you don't mind the dinosaurs not being seen for a while. First there's the eccentric billionaire, John Hammond played by the charming Sir Richard Attenborough, who makes you believe in the magic of the dinosaurs and park. Next is the scientific experts who are brought to the park to be the first to see the dinos, they are Alan grant played by Sam Neil, Ellie Sattler played Laura Dern, and Ian Malcolm played by the hilarious Jeff Goldblum who provides the funniest one liners in the film. And Hammonds grandchildren Lex and Tim also come along for the tour. And there are still so many extras that play such a delightful part and add to the magic of this movie.The Dinosaurs: Unlike other movie monsters, the dinos are portrayed as beautiful creatures to be marveled at, but to be feared. The dinos are brought to life through impressive puppetry, animatronics and CGI that still holds up to this day, in fact they look more lifelike than anything modern movies can do. Of course there are some moments where the cgi looks faded, but it doesn't break the illusion. If your a dino geek like me, you probably thought you knew what real dinos would look and sound like, well this movie shattered my interpretation of dinos as a kid, and i never have seen them the same way again, in fact i always compare real dinos to these ones. The dinos are the grand spectacle of this film, and they are still able to amaze and scare people, young and old, that see them.The Dialogue: Besides funny one liners, the movie has very rich thought provoking dialogue that pulls you into the film. While having lunch, Hammond and Malcolm debate on whether its humans place to play God. There are so many iconic and memorable moments in this movie, but the #1 line has to be "" Life finds away"".The Music: What can i say about John Williams theme that hasn't already been said, it is pure magic, as soon as it plays over the shot of the island, you know this is no longer just a movie, its an experience. The music enhances every scene its used in whether its a whimsical or horror moment, it makes you feel like you've never felt before.The Magic: This movie can never be remade, and no other movie can even come close to it. This movie is pure magic, Steven Spielberg and all of the creators of this movie put all of their passion into making this movie, that it leaks through. I have so much respect for the hardships they went through ( a literal hurricane) just to bring this movie to life. This movie has brought me nothing but pure bliss from the time i saw it as a kid to me as an adult. From beginning to end this movie captures my full attention and transports me to that park with the other characters. The atmosphere and realism of the park is so compelling, that it hurts to know its not real. If its not obvious by now, i don't just love this movie, this movie is apart of my very soul. I have basically collected so much memorabilia of it, that i don't think ill ever be satisfied until a real dinosaur is brought to life, as disastrous as that might be, until then ill just go to universal studios for that. And even though real dinosaurs are still extinct, they will always live on in my heart and Jurrassic park.","

"nicolechan916","24 March 2016","The story of Jurassic Park is certainly a unique one, and is based on the book of the same name by Michael Crichton. The creative world of Jurassic Park shows us one possibility of how dinosaurs would live if they existed in modern society. Though the science of it isn't very convincing, they did a great job at creating a scientific sort of atmosphere. Adding to that, the cast fits well into their roles, and the acting is pretty good. Sam Neill is a little expressionless and mumbles quite a bit, but is otherwise a good fit for his character. Larura Dern gives a great performance, and I especially like her rebuttals in the face of sexism. However, Ariana Richards and Joseph Mazzello, who play the grandchildren, are pretty much the only ones who react like they should when faced with a dinosaur- that is, with fright and terror. Jeff Golblum seems to be there only for comic relief, and mostly delivers his lines awkwardly. Surprisingly, the visuals for this film is very realistic and not at all like I would have imagined a 90's film to be. Not like some films with horrible CGI work, the film-makers and animators of Jurassic Park went through extensive renderings and scans to compile realistic visuals and movements of the dinosaurs. Some action is obviously fake, but overall, this film had great visual effects. Finally, the soundtrack for the film is amazing, with each song fitting into the setting of the scene perfectly. The suspenseful and thrilling scenes have music that aids in giving the audience that sense of anticipation. In some scenes the music is a little cheeky in that the film-makers are deliberately letting you know that something is going to happen, and is aware that you know. Overall, a fun film with excellent production quality and great directing. A film worthy of being in the 'classics' category.","

"geminiredblue","16 June 2015","The prolific writer Michael Crichton was famous for writing stories about science gone awry. Naturally, he'd probably get around to genetic experimenting. Hence, JURASSIC PARK came into being. The novel was monumental for capturing the imaginations of readers. Honestly, who wouldn't want to see dinosaurs again? When the book made a splash, it was almost inevitable that a movie would be made at some point. Directed by none other than Steven Spielberg, the film is a masterpiece.Imagine being a little kid, sitting in the darkened theater, as the credits roll on a black screen underscored by eerie vocals. The screen fades into an as-yet-unknown location. It's pitch black, harsh spotlights illuminating the area. A group of heavily-armed men stand around a fenced-in compound. A cage is slowly lowered in. The men jump back as whatever's inside screeches at them. Despite being hissed at, the group push the cage into place. But that ""something inside"" goes on a rampage, knocking the cage and the men out of the way. In the process, one of the workers gets grabbed. Screams and growls reverberate off the theater walls as whatever's inside slowly eats the man alive. Despite the other workers' best efforts to stop the creature. Scary? Oh yeah! And we haven't even seen the first dinosaur yet! Following the accident, the story really takes off: In order to quell the safety concerns from the park's investors, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) invites a small team of experts and his grandchildren to take a trial vacation at his island resort. What they discover is a magnificent theme park populated by genetically-engineered dinosaurs. But their amazement quickly melts into fear when the power goes out, and the fences start coming down. Now, on the run from the dangerous prehistoric carnivores, they must find a way to survive and escape Jurassic Park. Still twenty-some years later, the special effects and CGI are astounding. Never before (or since, in most cases) have dinosaurs looked so alive on-screen. All the actors give their roles 110%. For you, the viewer, you'll be thrilled, chilled, and amazed at everything happening in this movie. Come on, it's a Spielberg movie! Followed by two ""less-than-classic"" sequels. With JURASSIC WORLD out now in theaters, why not go back and re-live it all over again?!","

"caseynicholson","5 June 2015","This week I've been watching the ""Jurassic Park"" trilogy in preparation for ""Jurassic World"" which hits theaters next weekend. I am ashamed to say that I've gone twenty-two years since this movie came out without ever having seen it. I think that likely had to do with the fact that I've just never been that big into dinosaurs, and so the general theme of the film just didn't appeal to me. Having watched it, I can say that I enjoyed it quite a bit.I'm giving the film an 8/10 stars, albeit with thoughts of giving it just a seven. I decided to go with the eight because I think that if I try to be as objective as possible, the film probably deserves that. It's an extremely well made film about the dangers of science run amok. The dinosaurs at times look a bit awkward, but, hey--it was 1993...animation and CGI effects have come a long way since then. Still, the film has aged relatively well. The story is good overall, and the acting is not half bad, though I would say that it has more of a feel of an 80's popcorn movie than a 90's blockbuster hit. Throughout the film I could see shades of ""The Goonies"" and ""E.T."" in Spielberg's filmmaking style.That said, my relative disinterest in the whole dinosaur vibe still was a bit of a wall toward getting into the film, which is why I say I toyed with the idea of only seven stars. But this movie is definitely fun and engaging, and I would recommend it to just about anyone. If you've never seen it before, you're sure to find yourself catching a scene or two that immediately screams ""classic movie moment"", and it's a great movie to just enjoy with the family for an evening of escapism from the real world.","

"elainehowie","14 June 2018","This film is truly great! The visuals are a treat, the suspense and adventure is astounding and the characters are all interesting in their own way and the acting is pretty much spot on. I love this film as it effectively manages to capture what it would be like if man and dinosaurs somehow existed at the same time. It shows that dinosaurs can be big and scary or majestic and inspiring. I also like how the whole mosquito in Amber thing was explained, and dinosaurs didn't randomly just appear on the island!","

"Op_Prime","15 April 2000","Jurassic Park was an amazing film. The computer graphics were spectacular and an amazing site for all to see. The plot is incredibly original. Many scenes were very suspenseful, including the scenes with the raptors and the T-Rex. The actors are very good, especially Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum. There were some neat character developing scenes, but I liked the scenes with the dinos more. A lot more fun there. Thumbs way up!","

"gizmomogwai","8 February 2008","I was 9 when this movie came out, and it became a big part of my childhood. I watched it many times. To me then, it was the perfect movie. Hence, it's hard to look at it nowadays and rate it objectively. I'm familiar with it and still love it, but it's not the kind of film I most love these days. How do you express that this movie is still extraordinary and entertaining while also admitting it's not very deep concerning story and characters? (Although I liked the characters). Should I admit that the ending, with the rex sneaking into the building somehow and eating the raptors, is imperfect? How'd it get in? Does it matter? Was seeing the rex one last time worth it, as Spielberg thought? Spielberg was, at any rate, at fine form here, with such great detail packed into the film. This was King Kong for its generation- the recreation of ancient dinosaurs, only this time more convincing than ever. The special effects are great, better than Jurassic Park III's and only outdone by the first sequel The Lost World.I think, with such great dinosaurs, one shouldn't overlook the fact that the humans are good too. Sam Neill and Bob Peck play their parts well, Laura Dern shows range from charming enthusiasm to fear to disgust to professionalism, Richard Attenborough's enthusiastic and proud. What of Wayne Knight? I believe Ebert said something about his part not really fitting, but I don't see it that way- again, having grown up with this movie, it became a standard for other movies, and I see little wrong with it. The music in this movie is also excellent. Still a great film, even if not the greatest film.","

"ambusched94","8 July 2022","I won't deny this is a classic in sci-fi action adventure thriller films because it will be indefinitely. Technical aspects are perfect and the visual effects are innovative for it's time, the animatronic dinos and digital effects still holding up supremely well. My ultimate favorite scene is the dilophosaurus scene with Dennis Nedry; minutely minimal in gore but still everlastingly, horrifically frightening. The only nitpick I have is that the climax (when the velociraptor pack attack them in the guest center building and then suddenly a T-Rex storms in) is heavily predictable, inconsistent to the prior buildup of suspense and dread in the rest of the film. Disappointing, uninspired, basic climax to a groundbreaking sci-fi thriller.","

"Peter T. Movie","11 January 1999","One of the things I don't like about this movie is they try just a little bit to hard to make the Dinosaurs look like birds. Yes, SOME dinosaurs have a lot in common with birds, but a lot of them don't. This is one reason why like ""The lost world: JP"" better when it comes to the dinosaurs. ""The lost world"" tries mostly to make the Dinosaurs look like animals in general. I hard the word Birds so many times in JP I wanted to vomit. Personally, I put Dinosaurs in their own category. I give this movie a 9 (out of 10).","

"jhclues","2 January 2001","It's indeed rare when a movie comes along that is so special, and has such a tremendous impact on audiences of all ages, that when it happens, it's an occasion for celebration; which is exactly what Steven Spielberg gave the world with `Jurassic Park,' a film that made the impossible possible:  It enabled dinosaurs to walk among us.  He put these monsters from a bygone era on the screen for all to see, and the unique thing about it was that they were real; so real you could reach out and touch them it seemed.  And in doing so he touched the imaginations of every child who sat there in the dark of a theater and watched his creations come to life, and he touched the child that still resides within every adult who came to see his show as well.  Jaded moviegoers and those who affect cynicism as a mission statement of life may scoff, especially now, after some time has passed and the magic has worn off somewhat, but it doesn't alter the fact that with this movie, Spielberg surpassed any and all standards of the cinematic world and set the precedent for all that would follow.  To borrow a line from one of his own characters, he `Spared no expense,' and simply made one of the most exciting and memorable films in the history of the Silver Screen. 	Spielberg pulled out all the stops to make this remarkable film, and it goes without saying that the special F/X are incredible; what's easy to overlook amid all the spectacle of it, however, are the performances turned in by one and all, and most notably by Jeff Goldblum, who brings such nuance and style to the role of Dr. Ian Malcolm.  It's a supporting role into which he immersed himself to create one of the more memorable characters in the film, and his performance-- with the countenance and attitude he lends to Malcolm, even the commanding, mesmerizing way he speaks-- has never received the attention it so richly deserved.  Nor has the performance of Richard Attenborough, as John Hammond, the entrepreneur who makes Jurassic Park a reality.  He's such a gifted performer that he makes you forget he's acting; Hammond becomes real, which makes what he's doing real, and it's just another example of the many things that add up to make this such an incredible movie.  Spielberg and his cast and crew have given such care to detail that it, in effect, releases the viewer from the baggage of even having to suspend disbelief because they're given a world that is `real' from the ground up.  The result of using all of the magic available, and using it wisely. 	Also turning in outstanding-- and entirely believable performances-- are Sam Neill, as Dr. Alan Grant, and Laura Dern, as Dr. Ellie Sattler, each creating figures central to the plot and around whom much of the action revolves.  And there are a number of performances in supporting roles that are just too good to go unmentioned as well,  including Bob Peck, as Muldoon, the park's head gamekeeper; Martin Ferrero, as the `blood-sucking' lawyer, Donald Gennaro; Wayne Knight, as computer hacker Dennis Nedry; Samuel L. Jackson, as computer programmer Ray Arnold; and last, but not least, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards as Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, through whose eyes the child in all of us vicariously experiences the wonders of Jurassic Park. 	The wonderful thing about a movie like `Jurassic Park' is that, not only will it forever remain as a testimonial to a filmmaker of genius and vision, but that it will be there for all the generations that follow to discover anew.  The world may change drastically around us, even from one day to the next, but as long as even a single spark of imagination survives, one thing will always remain constant:  The fascination by children of all ages for these legendary beasts that once ruled the earth.  And that is why, when all is said and done and the skeptics have become no more than shadows and dust, this film-- as well as Steven Spielberg-- will remain a cause for celebration.  This is the legacy, and the true magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.","

"SanteeFats","7 July 2013","I could not to own this movie. I think it can not get any better for a movie of this genre. The casting is excellent. There is humor along with the terror and horror that is encountered by the humans. The computer generated images are so life like and their mobility is very smooth, not jerky or blurry like in some movies. Jeff Goldblum is extremely good and funny in his role as the chaos proponent Dr. Ian Malcolm. Sam Neill is great as the older dinosaur specialist and Laura Dern is a good back up. I actually like the Jurassic Park movies a lot better than Spielberg's Star Wars stuff. I have watched the Jurassic movies several times and the Star Wars series I don't even own.","

"petra_ste","29 November 2014","Steven Spielberg has always been at his best with blockbusters. Although he is a master storyteller and a peerless technician, his serious movies, while always worth watching, can undermine their pathos with an excess of sentimentalism (""James, earn this!"", ""Give us free!"", ""I could have saved more!"") and an array of weak endings (Minority Report, AI, War of the Worlds...).However, Spielberg's childlike glee and exuberance serve him well in more lighthearted fare (although the horrendous Kingdom of the Crystal Skull really gave me pause). NOBODY could craft an exciting action set-piece as well as pre-2000s Spielberg: his best efforts (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark...) remain unparalleled in escapist cinema.Jurassic Park, smartly adapted from Michael Crichton's novel (is there a better premise in modern science fiction?), is one of Spielberg's triumphs. Performances are tone-perfect; Jeff Goldblum's witty Malcolm is a crowd-pleaser, but my favorite character remains Sam Neill's Alan Grant, whose evolution from sour child-hater to caring protector gives the movie some much needed humanity lacking in the sequels - see Jurassic World and Chris Pratt's tediously infallible action figure.John Williams' soundtrack is phenomenal, conveying both awe and terror, excitement and sweetness - one of the composer's best works.The attention to the smallest detail is palpable. See how chaos expert Malcolm and benevolent ""creator"" Hammond (Attenborough) are clad respectively in black and white, symbolizing disorder and order, yin and yang. It's a small touch, but few other blockbusters bother with this kind of things.And those special effects... with a few irrelevant exceptions, it's mind-boggling how well they have aged. With their blend of practical effects and computer graphics, they still look amazing after twenty years (they have a WEIGHT, a physical presence), while today most special effects-heavy films are instantly dated, a garish slideshow of vaporous CGI.Still, the main star here is Spielberg. Scenes like the T-Rex breakout, the jeep chase or the hide and seek with the Raptors have earned their place in the collective memory of action cinema. Followed by four mostly worthless sequels.10/10","

"magical-kingdom","5 July 2015","Jurassic Park is an unforgettable cinematic experience that has no equal anywhere. Step back into an age where dinosaurs walked the earth. A truly great film with clever conversation,important themes alongside edge-of-your seat action and a gripping tale. This is the real deal.The classic is always the best....irrespective of how much better the graphics get in newer movies in the series. Spielberg's direction makes all the difference. A phenomenally successful sci-fi adventure thriller is graced by state-of-the-art special effects. The film follows two dinosaur experts -- Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) -- as they are invited by eccentric millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) to preview his new amusement park on an island off Costa Rica. FYI, after 25 months,filming was re-located to the Hawaiian island of Kauai and began on August 24,1992 due to Spielberg's concerns on infrastructure and accessibility.By cloning DNA harvested from pre-historic insects, Hammond has been able to create living dinosaurs for his new Jurassic Park, an immense animal preserve housing real brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, triceratops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaur Rex. Accompanied by cynical scientist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who is obsessed with chaos theory, and Hammond's two grandchildren, they are sent on a tour through Hammond's new resort in computer controlled touring cars. But as a tropical storm hits the island, knocking out the power supply, and an unscrupulous employee sabotages the system so that he can smuggle dinosaur embryos out of the park, the dinosaurs start to rage out of control. Grant then has to bring Hammond's grandchildren back to safety as the group is pursued by the gigantic man-eating beasts. Even though it was adapted from a book, this unique story was destined to become an incredible film. Great casting, excellent acting, awesome special effects,superior directing. Steven Spielberg made this story a landmark standard for thriller films to be compared to. The instant classic scenes, such as the first time they see the dinosaurs, the kitchen scene with the raptors, the end scene with the raptors and the T-Rex, the scene with the T-Rex and the kids in the jeep, and of course the unforgettable scene when the T-Rex chases the jeep.","

I read the book ""Jurassic Park"" by Michael Crichton quite many years after i had first seen the movie, and whilst there was obviously some changes it was nothing that disturbed me enough to praise the amazing motion-picture adaptation of the world famous novel. Jurassic Park whilst loved by many is also quite underrated, as for me and surely many others this movie belongs in the top elite with movie classics like The Godfather and Casablanca.A must see for all movie lovers!","

"abouhelier-r","1 June 2015","During a preview tour, a theme park suffers a major power breakdown that allows its cloned dinosaur exhibits to run amok.Jurassic Park is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. When I first saw this film it was the most mind blowing film I had ever experienced. On paper, the movie was made for Steven Spielberg: combining the scares of Jaws with the high tech, romance of E.T the Extra-Terrestrial , Close Encounters of the Third Kind and of course adding the challenge of creating the dinosaurs themselves. This 1993 dino-fest, has gone down in movie history as the film that cracked open the Pandora's box of cgi. This film is a true movie milestone, a real experience and it made an entire generation of children fall in love with dinosaurs. Jurassic Park changed the entire game of film making for ever, creating cgi dinosaurs that still holds up 20 years from then: good work Steven! He steped the bar so high that it's still there today. Michael Crichton who co-wrote the film with David Koepp presents his story on a fascinating and detailed note on both the possibilities and evils of modern science. Moreover, characters are all very good as each one of them have something special that make them human. Sam Neill isn't particularly close to children, Laura Dern actually has a strong female role and has a good chemistry with both Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum; who is one of those supporting characters that steals the entire show. Jeff Goldblum character is so much fun, he's smooth and smart, not this goofy guy that pops jokes every once in a while. Ian Malcolm is actually a well written character with a great brain and he seems to foreshadow what is going to happen. Plus, Richard Attenborough's character has so many layers which is very interesting. Each one of them are important and not just funny, they are likable characters who seems like real people with backgrounds and who all relate to the story. ""Welcome to Jurassic Park"" doesn't quite cover it. Spielberg did such a good job engrossing us into this world. From just a visual and technical aspect this film is near flawless. Watching this film 22 years later, there obviously some point where you can tell it's cgi but for the 95% of the film the cgi is still outstanding. The realism with which they were able to create those dinosaurs is amazing. They are all indeed a triumph of special effects artistry. Steven Spielberg created one of the most jaw-dropping scene in movie history. The brachiosaurs Neill and Dern see for the first time are tall, majestic leaf-eaters, grazing placidly in the treetops. There is a sense of grandeur to them. Half of that is due to John Williams brilliant theme. This music is fantastic! I love it so much, I may even love it more than Star Wars. This very scene when Sam Neill stares at them, with this music, at that point everything's okay with the world. Everything's perfect. We don't make movies like this anymore. That kind of silence in a movie when a character stares at something and the music swipes you into it. I miss that awe. Nowadays most of the movies are so quick-edited, so packaged and ready to be delivered on a theatre, so an audience could sit there and not be bored. This movie takes its time to tell a story, get you to the characters, make you understand the plot and then the dinosaurs are everywhere. Clearly dinosaurs dominate Jurassic Park in every way. Amazingly graceful and convincing, they set a sky-high new standard for computer generated special effects. They create a triumphant illusion. You believe you have spent some time in a dino-filled world. Plus, Spielberg built up an imminent sense of threat over the first hour of the movie. In fact, Jurassic Park keeps its viewers on edge of their seats while leaving the real violence to the imagination. Besides, this film has the best jump scares ever, that I won't spoil if you didn't already see the movie (but if you don't I beg you to), because Spielberg didn't go for the numb cliché. He knows how to create legitimate tension in his film and it's not just the tension in the last half which is so fun and impressive but the sustain wonder through the entire first half of the film. Two set pieces ares especially effective: the first one is a scene where a T-Rex mauls a car with screaming children inside, and the other one is when the children play hide and seek with two velociraptors in the park's kitchen. Everybody can stage a fight, but it takes Mr Steven Spielberg to show just how the plots and pans might go flying at the stroke of a velociraptor's tail. This scene also helps to look at the bigger picture. Who but Steven Spielberg could convince an audience that there are dinosaurs loose in a kitchen at all? Jurassic Park smacks everyone in the face with awe, imagination, and all the things that are the reasons why movies are made. Tastes in movies are subjective but in my opinion the answer to: why movies are made? Definitely is movies such as Jurassic Park, Star Wars or even recently Marvel Guardians of the Galaxy. Overall Steven Spielberg, the man who invented the summer event movie took Michael Crichton's book and transformed it into an awe-inspiring legendary blockbuster, using every inch of the screen he was given with cool characters, impressive cgi, wonder and danger. Jurassic Park changed entertainment at a genetic level.","

"roystephen-81252","18 February 2016","To me, a really great movie is one that is both consistently entertaining and has something profound to say. One that has vivid imagination and gorgeous visuals, offering a spectacle you have never seen before. (Of course, it has to have at least some internal logic that does not insult your intelligence, as well.) One that has you glued to the screen from start to finish. One that has iconic moments you'll never forget.Jurassic Park ticks all these boxes. It is endlessly rewatchable, great entertainment, with a meaningful message about Man playing God. When I first saw it at the theatre, for a dinosaur fan like me, it was pure heaven, a dream come true. It is not a children's movie, however (I was about twenty at the time). It is violent, sometimes gory, very suspenseful and has some genuinely scary moments involving child characters. (I seriously thought at the time that at least one of them would not survive the T. Rex attack, for example. Of course I knew it would not happen – after all, it's a Spielberg flick – but up to that point I had never seen children thrown into such deadly perils scene after scene in any movie.)Highlights (those 'iconic moments'): the water in the plastic cup, the goat, the T. Rex attack, Tim in the mud under the belly of the car, the T.Rex in the rear-view mirror, Arnold's arm, the green jelly, the raptors in the kitchen (my favourite shot is that of the raptor's claw knocking on the floor) and many many more.PS. I saw the 3D version, as well, and it works surprisingly well in several scenes. I still find post-conversion totally pointless (even movies originally shot in 3D rarely exploit the true potential of 3D technology), but for a post-converted movie, Jurassic Park 3D is pretty good.","

"mitchell5954","11 January 2019","Jurassic Park is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of all time. If I made a list of my favorite movies Jurassic Park would be in the top twenty or even top ten. It's an amazing experience that everyone should see if you love cinema. The characters are great and fun, it's grand, it's suspenseful, and the effects look monumental. These are among some of the best effects I've seen on film.The music is also iconic and has a lot to do with why the film is as good as it is. John Williams, in my opinion, is the greatest composer to come out of Hollywood. He's done some of the most iconic themes in movies. You have Jurassic Park, The Lost World, The Star Wars films, The Indiana Jones films, Superman The Movie, Home Alone, among others. He is a legend in the world of music.The cast is great as well. I often feel like these people are very underappreciated. Of everyone in the cast the one who has gone on to do the most by far is Samuel L. Jackson. Jeff Goldblum was big for a bit after this film but he pretty much went nowhere by the 2000s. He also gets a lot of crap from critics now which I feel is undeserved as I actually like him as an actor.Sam Neil hasn't done much either in the 2000s at least as far as American films go. He's done some TV shows which went nowhere. I feel he's one of the most underappreciated actors as he's personally one of my favorites.The same applies with Laura Dern who's probably one of my favorite actresses. Richard Attenborough also does a great job as John Hammond. He is greatly missed. The rest of the cast does good work as well.Overall, if you want a grand and epic experience or just want to see a great monster movie than here you are. Hell, if you're a fan of dinosaurs in general than this is the movie to watch. This and Land Before Time made me fascinated with dinosaurs as a kid. It was one of my favorite films then and now.","

The acting, writing, timing, sound, special FX...basically everything in this movie made it great.  And once you read or see a special on how hard it was to create, you may appreciate it a lot more.

"gigan-92","3 June 2010","Grade: A I don't know how people can possibly review this movie negatively. It's a ground breaking experience for its time, a time when most films were still struggling to break the limitations set by technology. And yet in 1993 (1992 in places like Japan) comes this marvel, and surely anyone would be stunned.I saw it around seven or eight and every kid that age is fascinated by dinosaurs. Aren't we all? To see them brought to life so realistically was astounding. My favorite scene in the film, if not film history is the T-Rex's emergence. Spielberg directs as he always does, making it seem so real. This was due to the aid of Michael Crichton, the original author. Now I've read the book and trust me the actual novel is a bit more graphic. The characters are not as plain as some have claimed. I believe more than good enough.Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are excellent, and who doesn't love Laura Dern in some booty shorts (lolz)? Hammond is played by Richard Attenborough, a good choice. The drama is riveting and there is definitely a theme at work: it is not the role of man to play God, because when they do, ""nature finds an away."" The action is fueled by pure adrenaline and beauty at times, but most common is sheer terror, as in the famous kitchen scene. It has an edge that will have you biting your nails every time. Gotta love the Velociraptor screech; it's just so alien, you know? And during all of this is John Williams, including that unforgettable theme. Unless you are a loser and don't remember itAnd so, haters back off and regard this film as the classic it is. Give the cast credit, even though none can deny the real stars were never really there (or from time to time represented by animatronics robots). They created all the wonder and fascination for the big screen and I state that this is one of Spielberg's greatness.","

"griffolyon12","12 March 2009","Jurassic Park is one of the landmark films of my childhood. One of the earliest memories I have of ever going to see a movie at a movie theater was of seeing this movie. For simple nostalgic reasons this has always been one of my favorite movies, but I think in a way I never fully appreciated the film until I have become an adult.Jurassic Park is truly up there with Jaws as one of the most thrilling monster movies of all-time. Each time Tim and Lex get chased by the velociraptors, my heart pounds. When the T-Rex attacks the jeep on that rainy night, I always get filled with raw excitement. It is hard not to be thrilled by Jurassic Park's many death defying set pieces, but the film truly shines thanks to its characters and its director.What makes Jurassic Park more than your average amusement park ride, is that the director, Steven Spielberg, knew that the film would need great characters in order for the audience to feel any sort of attachment to the film's story. This was a ploy in which he utilized so well in the past in Jaws, and he does here once again with Jurassic Park. The story of Alan Grant leading Tim and Lex through the dinosaur filled Jurassic Park would have not been as thrilling, or even as heartwarming, if Alan Grant was a fan of children. Still the characters on the page were not enough, they needed great actors to bring them to life, which Jurassic Park had; ranging from Sam Neil to Richard Attenborough. I mean could you imagine watching Jurassic Park without Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. It's almost impossible isn't it.Overall I think Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated films in movie history. The classic Spielberg magic is there, and in my opinion even more so than Jaws. What Spielberg did with Jurassic Park was give it an awe inspiring scale, but also he gave this film true heart. As a kid I thought this was one of the greatest films of all-time, and I still think the same today.I give Jurassic Park a perfect 10 out of 10!","

"LoneWolfAndCub","6 February 2007","It's been 5 years since I've seen this and today I re-visited this timeless classic. I never realised it was so exciting and a movie that just never gets old. Steven Spielberg adapts the novel faithfully and brings the dinosaurs to life with amazing technology which still amazes me to this day. John William's score is still as unforgettable as ever, it's just a really beautiful and moving score that suits the movie perfectly. Sam Neill and Laura Dern are perfect as the leads and Richard Attenborough is a great support.The standout here, though, are the special effects. The dinosaurs are re-created beautifully and all the action scenes are genuinely believable and never hokey. When this came out in 1993 audiences worldwide were amazed, they had never seen something so amazing and it topped the box-office (until Titanic arrived in 1997). This is truly the ultimate blockbuster and I don't think it can be beaten. This is a true cinematic gem and it is what entertainment is all about.4½/5","

"SnoopyStyle","2 January 2014","Nutty John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has invited Dr. Grant (Sam Neill), Dr. Sattler (Laura Dern), Dr. Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the company lawyer (Martin Ferrero) and his 2 grandkids to test out his Jurassic Park. Hammond has successfully cloned dinosaurs from the blood found in mosquitoes trapped in amber.It's a thrill ride using the state of the art CGI. The audience at the time would marvel at the realistic CG dinosaurs. It takes about an hour to set up and get to the exciting part. And Spielberg has more than just CGI to get the thrills. His mastery delivers one of the simplest and most iconic shot in the movie, the pulsing water. This and 'Schindler's List' would bookend his great year, and cement his greatest.","

"TheMovieDoctorful","11 October 2019","Escapist cinema doesn't get any more magical than Jurassic Park. It's a film that enchanted me as a child and awakens my inner child as an adult like no other. Every second on Isla Nublar is a reminder of nature's majesty and mystery that got me labeled ""the animal fact kid"" as a grade schooler. Not even just the dinosaurs, the lush, tropical greenery set against that epic, rousing score gets my attention and awe the moment Hammond's helicopter arrives on Nublar. The beauty of what Hammond and InGen have created is so hypnotizing, it's incredibly easy to forget their failures. Even its scenes of gruesome violence and death have an odd primal allure to them, the spell remaining unbroken. Those failures aren't what cynics and detractors of the franchise as a whole will tell you; the sheer act of creating dinosaurs wasn't Hammond's mistake. It was treating nature as entertainment.The sequels, contrary to what people will say, are not bad (Outside Jurassic Park III, at least), nor do they betray the original's themes. Both The Lost World and Fallen Kingdom do a perfect job showing the utter horrors of commercializing life itself as product. The original Jurassic Park, however, has a different goal. It's to suck the audience into the illusion that said commercialization is something positive and valid. Hammond didn't set up Jurassic Park as a nature preserve to study these animals for scientific purposes or to create a new ecosystem. There's a reason he describes Jurassic Park as a ""theme park"" first and foremost. There's a reason he puts a macho, toxically masculine Great White Hunter in charge of security instead of a biologist or paleontologist (who he only seeks out when faced with legal trouble) ""Everyone in the world has the right to enjoy these animals!"" he practically gloats. They're his personal toys, created for the purpose of amusement and blatant exploitation. They're denied even the basic right to breed outside a controlled environment, every baby's birth oversought by Hammond himself (who will certainly forget about each and every one) rather than a responsible and doting parent. While Hammond's characterization is certainly less malevolent than in Michael Crichton's rich source material, he's still very much unsympathetic and unsubstantial on multiple fronts. It's no accident that he began life as a professional charlatan working a flea circus.It's curious how people always want to highlight Ian Malcolm as the voice of reason here. In this film, at least, he comes off more like a contrarian cynic than anything (He's wiser and more idealistic in The Lost World, but only after spending time in the company of death in the first film) If anyone provides sincere reason in this film, it's Dr. Ellie Sattler. From the very beginning, she's not just throwing cheap shots like Malcolm, she's making genuine observations of Hammond's failures. Picking poisonous plants for display in his visitor center for aesthetic reasons, bringing dinosaurs into an environment they don't fully recognize to interact regularly with a species it has never met, allowing poisonous berries in dinosaur enclosures purely because an accident hasn't happened yet, these are very specific problems that Ellie is quick to point out. One of my biggest (and only) problems with the sequels was that Ellie never really had a presence in any of them despite being the biggest role model and smartest characater in the original film by far. Malcolm has plenty of development in the first film, as does Grant, but Ellie feels like the most constructive and positive force against the carnage of Jurassic Park by far.The flea circus scene between Ellie and Hammond is one of my favorites in film history. The battle between self righteous ego (""Creation is an act of pure will!"") and well rounded logic (""It's still the flea circus!"") is as brutal and staying as any dinosaur attack. It wonderfully highlights both Ellie's strength while bringing Hammond's pathos and narcissism to the forefront. It's not quippy or catchy and it's rarely quoted, but it's easily the best written and acted scene in the film as well as the most powerful.Everyone's discussed it, but I would be remiss not to talk about the revolutionary special effects. The animatronics and CGI perfectly balance the weight of these prehistoric titans with their stunning speed. The biggest problem with modern CGI is its negligence to recognize the complexity and rawness of flesh, of muscle, of brawn. Jurassic Park's achievement in capturing that rawness is something seen maybe 2 - 5 times a decade. At least one of those times per decade, it's by a film in this very franchise. It's a standard practically unreachable by an age that uses it as a crutch more than a tool.The musical score has more than earned its place as a classic, but even that has a depth to it that goes unrecognized. Its frequent use of Congo drums after its initial use of a rousing, trumpeting anthem definitely fits with a story about capitalist exploitation of the unknown for its own petty entertainment. It really speaks to the level of detail put into the entire production that even the musical score brings weight to the themes.Martin Scorsese recently made the statement that superhero films were ""theme park cinema"", which has caused a fair amount of uproar, but films like this make me question whether that's a derogatory statement at all. Theme park films can be high brow. They can have character and themes and genuine weight, they can inspire and captivate and teach. Jurassic Park is a prime example of that and one of the most nuanced, critical and thematically rich blockbusters of all time that never loses its rewatchability.","

"cLoNe","22 July 2001","The groundbreaking computer generated dinosaurs are only one aspect that makes this movie so cool. An engrossing bizarre plot about men playing God and fantastic action-adventure scenes make this movie really exciting and enjoyable.   It is a mixture of many great ingredients: horror, action, comedy, thriller, suspense. And everything is directed with great efficiency by Spielberg.    I read the book before I saw the movie and I was disappointed to see the horror and the violence toned down so much, as well as missing some of the dinosaurs that didn't make it through the adaptation (though the ""missing"" dinosaurs were finally introduced in JP3). But I wasn't THAT disappointed.   It's simply enjoyable. It's like one big roller coaster ride. It is a bit formulaic, but also inventive and very well done.","

"tml_pohlak_13","12 March 2009","Story time! I remember that, as a little kid, at a friend's house one day, everyone started watching a Jurassic Park movie (I now know it was the second one). Anyhow, I managed to get scared out of my wits within the first 10 minutes. Long story short, Jurassic Park was one of the movies my mom would never let me watch as a kid. So it kind of sucked, me ""playing the home game"" while the other kids talked about how amazing Jurassic Park was (ah! I miss the grade school days). I miraculously managed to not have the movie spoiled (or not to remember having it spoiled). So when my film teacher announced ""we're going to watch a movie that, like Terminator 2, really developed special effects: Jurassic Park"", I was really pleased that I would finally get to see just how good the film all the kids way back when loved was. I was not disappointed.Have I mentioned how much I love Steven Spielberg? Well, I will now. Spielberg is an amazing director, without a doubt my favourite. He has yet to let me down. First of all, the graphics in Jurassic Park are amazingly believable, even though it's obviously fake watching it today. Second, Spielberg's direction style is just amazing. Many shots were reinforced and made really powerful thanks to his handling of the camera (combined with a heavenly score from the great John Williams).Prior to Jurassic Park, I couldn't remember many thrillers where I was genuinely thrilled. Things don't explode to provide a moment's excitement in Jurassic Park, it is a pure roller-coaster of thrills from beginning to end. I also genuinely cared for what happened to the characters. Terrific acting took care of that. How good was it? Let's put it this way: I have a terrible habit of biting my nails. I never once did this while watching Jurassic Park.The movie's main villain, Dennis Nedry, is one of the most interesting villains I've ever seen. Spielberg purposely makes his intentions unclear. Was he planning to return and put the park back to normal? Or was he going to leave with the boat, and abandon everyone? Either way, as much as I hated the idiot for shutting down the electrical fences, I didn't hate him enough to want him to die. I was genuinely frightened for the guy when he confronted the dinosaur.""The human characters are a ragtag bunch of half-realized, sketched-in personalities, who exist primarily to scream, utter dire warnings, and outwit the monsters"", Mr. Ebert? I think not! I don't know just what it was: John Williams' music, Spielberg's direction, or fantastic acting, but every character, from Richard Attenborough's to the two kids, was fully developed in the movie. This is a thriller that genuinely thrills (I'm happy to say I've been desensitized as to the disturbing bits).Apparently, when Jurassic Park came out, my uncle bought tickets and saw it thirteen times. Before I saw it, I thought to myself, ""How could you see a movie so many times?"" Now that I've seen it, I see why. Jurassic Park is a masterpiece, and a groundbreaking achievement in technology as well. Thank you, Steven Spielberg! The least I can do is give this movie a very enthusiastic 10/10.","

"Hitchcoc","24 February 2006","There are a handful of movies that absolutely grab a person. The case I had on jury duty had been settled out of court and so I had an afternoon to see a movie. This is the one. I had anticipated it for so long and was ready for the disappointment that usually follows. It didn't happen. From the moment that Richard Attenborough says, ""Welcome to Jurassic Park,"" I was hooked. And when the Brachiosaurs come lumbering across the grassy park, I was stunned. I know that since that time, computer generated special effects have become regular fair, but this was amazing. The other part of it, however, is that this a masterful story with a great deal of complexity (chaos theory, etc.). The people are interesting; the villain foolish and in over his head. Then there is wonderful set up of a park that is foolproof, suddenly losing its security. I don't normally like child actors, but the two in this express the terror that they indeed should. Some films hammer one with so many images; this one still relies on the greatest method of scaring people. It's not what you see; it's what you don't see. It's what's lurking in the bushes. The other thing is that the characters are on the playing field of their adversaries. Kowledgeable as they are, they are not in their own world. Those veloceraptors are a nice touch. As I was growing up, enamored with dinosaurs like most kids, I had never even heard of these creatures. Granted some of the threat is orchestrated, the scene in the kitchen is as frightening as anything I've ever seen","

"I_Love_Spielberg","21 May 2008","What a movie! What a fabulous movie! Steven Spielberg does it once again with ""Jurassic Park."" He proves that he can do anything and that dinosaurs weren't monsters, they were animals. It may not be accurate to the book, but it's still a masterpiece.In case you don't know what it's about, it's about the idea of genetically enhanced dinosaurs who are engineered to be harmless, and how a group of scientists are invited to see them and judge them on how safe and how real they are. But, something goes wrong...and that's where the action comes in.One thing that I liked was Jeff Goldblum. He was always my favorite actor. I find him to be a natural actor and the way he delivers his lines is great. It's like he's not even sticking to the script, he's just making it up as he goes along. Also, a beautiful score by John Williams. You can't get better than that.","

"RiffRaffMcKinley","31 December 2006","In the tradition of Spielberg's ""Jaws,"" ""Jurassic Park"" pits prehistoric creatures (in this case, extinct-- dinosaurs) against a random collection of human beings. While ""Jaws"" was a better film, and even this one was outdone by its sequel (the first sequel, anyway), it's still fun to watch the lizards munch on a few morons for fun who--let's face it-- are only put into the story in the first place as snacks. Every horror film has them. ""JP"" has its share of bad acting, bad scripting, and even less-than-competent directing, but the truth is this. People love the book as a classic. In reality, the book was about the most boring Crichton's ever come up with, and this movie was about as clever as Spielberg ever did.","

I went to take the form for entrance exam for my 9th grade, and while I was returning home I saw that Jurassic Park is being shown in a Cinema Hall. And I had seen some of the promos on star TV of that time, and discussed with some friends and relatives that this could be a good movie. So I went to see the movie at the age of 13. I saw the film and enjoyed the scariness a lot. Then after that several times whole school with teachers went to see the film and whole family went to see the film. And remained in my memory as an unforgettable event. Now whenever I see this film on my DVD with a lot of clarity and surround sound it still gives me the same enjoyment and thrill as it gave me when for the first time I saw it. This movie Jurassic Park is marvelous and I love it and I love it a lot. I do not want to say anything more, just I love it.","

Its not just about having big scary monsters stomping around, Jurassic Park gives the dinosaurs a transfixing majesty and wonder that its sequels would fail to grasp. This film goes beyond being just another monster movie, with more character and more heart than any others in the genre, dealing with themes of ambition and the consequences of playing God with nature. With an exceptional score by the legendary John Williams which further drives home the feelings of swaying melodic wonder, this film may well be the reason I have such high standards when it comes to film.","

"talarisw","16 April 2013","Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all time and is the king of Hollywood blockbusters and this is one of his greatest movies. What I love about Spielberg is how he's always thinking outside the box and doing things nobody else has and in result he had made one ground breaking movie after another making other similarly themed films look absolute in comparison. I mean only Spielberg would have the for-site to license the Jurrassic Park book by Micheal Crichton even before he finished writing it and long before it was released because he saw the movie potential. Before I get to the Dinosaurs let me talk about everything else. First I must praise Micheal Crichton for his brilliant concept. The story gives a plausible(granted not realistic) explanation to how people could resurrect Dinosaurs. The movie starts off strong as in a classic horror movie fashion we get a glimpse of a dinosaur, a Velociraptor attacks a human but we never see the Raptor it self. With a movie like this you expect the first fifteen minutes or so to be exposition and set-up and you expect that we have to wait awhile until we some Dinosaours. Well, all that's true but it's not a problem because Spielberg keeps the pace moving so nicely, it's never boring or slow. Spielberg just gives enough exposition that he needs to give, a old billionaire named John Hammond has a park with real life Dinosaurs and to please a lawyer who represents his sponsors he persuades two archaeologist and a scientist to come along to check it out and give their approval and our story begins. As great as the special effects are you need a great story and great human characters. The story is simple but well done, it makes a ludicrous premise of Dinosaurs being brought back from the dead into 1993 believable and that's because the movie takes it self seriously it's never comes off campy or ironic. The story is similar to Frankenstein as they show what happens when ""man"" play God. I like all the characters here. Richard Attenburrough is perfect as John, the old man who created the amusement park. I like that they never make him a bad guy or even crazy just misguided and you even feel bad for him when his amusement park dosen't go the way he hoped. The more or less hero of the story is Alan Grant played by Sam Neil, an up-tight archaeologist who dosen't like kids but later does after protecting John's grandkids from Dinosaurs, nothing really deep but a good fit for this story. In fact none of the characters are really deep but still strong characters capable of holding this movie. I like Laura Dern as Ellie, Alan's partner who's tough and fearless. Wayne Knight gives a memorable performance as the double crossing Dennis, who is the only true villain. Samuel L. Jackson is also good as one of the guys who operate the park. My favorite character might be Dr. Ian Malcolm played by Jeff Goldblum. I like how John described him as a ""rock star"" with his shades and leather jacket. It's hard to explain but Jeff is just so appealing and he brings some humor to the movie. I also really like Bob Peck as the expert hunter Rob Muldon, he's like the Van Henlson to Dinosaurs. I like his rivalry with Raptors and I feel bad when he's killed by one of them, I wish he would of came back for a sequel. But the best thing are the dinosaurs themselves. The special effects are amazing, especially for 1993. The Dinosaurs look real and I don't mean real looking for a movie I mean they look like their really alive. Nothing mechanical or cgi looking about them. The special effects are groundbreaking and some of the best in movie history. First we see the Brachiosaurs, which looks great as well as seeing a Triceatops which looked all too real. but the real moment comes when we see the most iconic Dinosaur of them all the Trannosaurus Rex, who emerges after the power goes out and Ian, Alan and the kids are stuck in a car in front of the T-Rex cage and it attacks the kids in the car. The special effects on the T-Rex looks frighteningly real and I love it's roar. Later the T-Rex chases Ellie, Rob, and Ian in a car which was also great. I also love the Dilophosaurs who attacks Dennis, I love how it's like a rattle snake but unfortunately the real Dinosaur dosen't have the neck fan or shot venom, that was created by Crichton but this is way better. The best Dinosaurs are the Velociraptors, no one even heard of them until this movie. That's one of the great things about this movie is that they introduced us to some lesser known Dinos. I understand for theatrics Spielberg had to make the Raptors more menacing then they really were but he did a great job at making the Dinosaurs be animals acting by instant not monsters. I love how intelligent they made the Raptors. The Raptors are my favorite Dinosaurs in this movie and they steal the show. Although the ending was a little contrived when the T-Rex came out of no where to save ""our heroes"" from three Raptors, two of which some how escaped a locked room but it made for a good climax any way. I also love the score by the great John Williams. The is def-intently the greatest Dinosaur movie of all time.","

"Red-Barracuda","13 December 2015","With Jurassic Park, director Steven Spielberg made a film that became the new yardstick for cinematic special effects back in 1993. In fact, the ground-breaking CGI work used here to bring dinosaurs to life before our eyes is still very impressive over twenty years after its release, so you can only imagine the impact that they had back in the day. Truthfully, the effects work is by far the most impressive thing about this one, as it has a fairly by-the-numbers story-line populated with clichéd characters. A select group of people are invited to an island retreat owned by a millionaire who has been able to recreate living dinosaurs from ancient DNA. It's here that he intends to give an early tour of his planned new resort, Jurassic Park; the trouble is that things go wrong and the dinosaurs go on the rampage.This was adapted from a Michael Crichton novel of the same name. I've read the book and seem to think that the novel and film are at the very least broadly similar. It's the second film from the pen of Crichton based on the very specific sci-fi idea of a futuristic high-tech amusement park going fatally wrong, leaving the humans to battle the dangerous inhabitants of the park; the other film of course was Westworld (1973), where it was deadly androids who filled the same roles as the dinosaurs do here. Both films speculate on questions regarding the dangers of man tampering with science in careless ways. For me Westworld is the better film but I do still enjoy Spielberg's dinosaur blockbuster. The effects work are worth the price of admission alone of course but the story-line and characters, while being extremely standard, do still get us from A to B and allow us to seamlessly experience the deadly wonders on hand in the park. It's a pretty solidly entertaining piece on the whole and one of Spielberg's better out-and-out popcorn movies.","

The plot is thin , there is no character development arc, no moodiness, no real atmosphere, not one single plot twist. Typical Spielberg. Despite this criticism, Jurassic Park is good entertainment for the entire family. Basically this is your typical monster-on-the loose flick, cloned dinosaurs chase a variety of humans, most of whom are sympathetic, while some of the victims are decidedly rotten. The CGI and the puppet animatronics really is the meat of this movie, no pun intended. This was the bleeding edge in film special effects in 1993 and holds up very well today. But overall the film is predictable, could have been better.","

"HelloTexas11","27 October 2007","I've seen Jurassic Park probably five or six times, and each time I hope I'll like it better than the last, and I never do. A perfectly wonderful book by Michael Crichton is given the 'Spielberg' treatment and aside from the wonderful special effects, betrayed badly.Where to begin? First and foremost, one of Spielberg's worst tendencies is to find annoying personal characteristics endearing. The two children aren't precocious and charming, they're little brats, no matter how hard the director tries to paint them otherwise. The character of John Hammond, in the book, was as I recall a rather devious, unscrupulous man; here, he is portrayed as a cheerful, slightly ditsy, misguided Santa Claus. And Laura Dern manages to almost single-handedly sink this movie. Her perpetual ""I don't know whether to laugh or cry"" expression is probably the single most irritating element in a film full of them. And everyone smiles WAY too much.Spielberg, for all his supposed genius, also delivers some of the most excruciating action and danger scenes on record. Whenever one of the human characters is in a spot, it is inevitably his or her own stupid fault. They can't lock the door, they won't turn the flashlight off, they're too scared to jump off the fence, they can't run fast enough... every damn scene is like this, to where you want to reach into the screen and slap the hell out of them.Sam Neill comes off best, in what is really a thankless role as the straight man for all this nonsense. But he's dragged down by the same sappy script.Well, what about those special effects, you might ask? Yes, the dinosaurs are spectacular and very believable (much more so than the humans really) and they are the only reason I'm giving this four stars out of ten. In 1993, we were still being blown away by filmmakers constantly upping the ante when it came to mind-blowing effects and sure enough, Jurassic Park was state-of-the-art when it came out. Since then, I daresay people have become more blase about such things as they have become more routine.To be fair, there are some wonderful sequences in Jurassic Park and it's certainly worth seeing at least once. I suppose ultimately that is the most maddening thing about it; it could have been so much better, not just another summer blockbuster, but a truly great motion picture. It's a real shame that it's not.","

"dinolover-22952","14 July 2016","It is the best science fiction movies with dinosaurs I have ever seen. I love dinosaurs, especially sauropods that were brought back through De- Extinction. Even though the raptors are terrifying, Most dinosaurs were peaceful. There should be a real life Jurassic Park, So I would be really happy. It was also the best movie ever, Having advanced CGI, animatronics, etc. back then, There are sequels to this movie I thought were also great, even if the other fans didn't like it. The sound effects are really life like. The dinosaurs even had most of their behavior almost accurate. I love how the scientists are attempting to bring back dinosaurs in the franchise. Best movie series ever. :)","

"marioarp1995","1 August 2011","Jurassic Park is the main reason I became a dinosaur fan. When I first saw this movie when I was about 3 or 4 I watched it mainly for the dinosaurs, which I still do but after watching it when I'm a lot older I started to not just love the dinosaurs but the IDEA of a theme park zoo filled with dinosaurs! I also think the story is amazing. I don't see how anyone could hate this film or give it a 1 out of 10. Also as you may know, Dr. Grants character is based on the famous paleontologist Jack Horner. Who as we speak is working on reverse engineering a chicken to give is teeth, tail, and change its wings to claws. This is just one of the many reasons I am interested so much in JP. It has inspired people and has been inspired by people. 10/10","

"ToldYaSo","24 April 1999","My friend Chris was one of the first people I know to see this film. He told me it was ""scary"".""Scary? It's a kids movie,"" I replied in disbelief, certain that I knew what I was talking about based on the previews I had seen and nothing else. At this point, I hadn't even read the book yet.""No way man, it's scary stuff,"" he assured me.""OK, well, I'll be seeing it soon anyway,"" I told him, thinking that maybe he was too easily frightened or had begun to lose it.My wife and I went within the first week of its release, no one else we knew had seen it aside from Chris. No one else could confirm or deny my expectations. We saw it at the York Theater in Toronto, a fine theater with all the Dolby Digital THX sound that today is far more commonplace. We sat in a packed theater in quite possibly the best seats in the house and prepared ourselves.We couldn't prepare enough.From the first appearance of the menacing T-Rex until the end of the film, I didn't relax for a moment. Not even in the ""calm-down-it's-sleepy-time"" part of the film. I was literally on the edge of my seat in sheer terror and awe of the film. It is by all definitions of the word, a thriller.It is with regret and a little shame that I confess that in my raving of the film, I may have spoiled it for others by raising their expectations too high, which is mainly why I like to see some films early on. My expectation was that this film was made for children and would probably be entertaining, but instead it floored me completely. I had difficulty with basic motor skills trying to exit the theater, I had been so tense throughout the entire film I could barely walk away.","

"robsta23","22 April 2015","I remember having a conversation with my cousin, asking him why Jurassic Park intrigued him if his priority when it comes to film is good character development. He said it has good philosophical discussion, and he pointed out the scene he was referring to: the ""life finds a way"" scene, and I had forgotten this gem within the movie. And recently a friend of mine pointed out that Dr. Grant ties two female ends of seat belts together to strap himself in which is a great metaphor for this motif of the dinosaurs supposedly being all female.These philosophical aspects, including the amazing scene focusing on a debate of whether it is responsible to try to add dinosaurs back into the swing of things altogether, raise the movie up higher than the mere B movie critics believe it to be. But is there anything wrong with the overall fun and excitement of this seemingly simple people? We see dinosaurs on-screen for the first time in a much different way - both with the use of animatronics and digitally. We also have the quirky characters such as Wayne Knight and Jeff Goldblum's characters to add to the fun.The film is pretty aware of itself, making references to King Kong and displaying the dinosaurs as a spectacle to future park-goers, just as the idea of the effects to make the dinosaurs are a spectacle to us as movie-goers. It also draws attention to its potential horror towards little kids with Dr. Grant illustrating the idea of a velociraptor to a cocky kid, and the grandkids that tag along for the park ride that are shown screaming on-screen.What a great, underrated movie by Spielberg.","

"KingBrian1","25 May 2014","The movie that made Palaeontology cool. Jurassic Park written by Crichton is brought to life with Spielberg's animatronic Dinosaur models and thrilling chase scenes. This movie is exhilarating, fun and terrifying.The story is basically about monster lizards breaking out of their restraints after a disgruntled employer plans to steal Dinosaur genetic code having shut off the islands power on which they were residing on.The more detailed story is one of Dr Hammond a wealthy eccentric philanthropist setting up an amusement park off the Costa Rica coast and cloning the fossils of extinct Dinosaurs to fill the island with Terror Lizards like Velociraptor & T Rex. This crazy idea needs the backing of experts like Alan Grant, Ellie Sattle & Ian Malcolm to sign up on this but when the park is exposed to a combination of bad weather bad employees and bad engineering the entire system collapses and so the remaining people on the Island must traverse the Park dodging the Dinosaurs and escape to safety.All in all a great movie of the 90's.","

"Hey_Sweden","29 December 2012","Co-scripted by Michael Crichton from his own best-seller, ""Jurassic Park"" is a great deal of fun, offering action, suspense, scares, amusing performances, and some of the most utterly convincing special effects that you'll see in a film of this type.Billionaire John Hammond (a delightful Richard Attenborough) has created an island theme park populated with living dinosaurs that he's had cloned from ancient dinosaur DNA. When issues as to the safety of the park arise, he hires renowned paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to inspect the place and hopefully give it their seal of approval. He's so confident of his security measures that he even lets his target audience, in the form of his grandchildren Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello), come along. Of course, one can guess that things are going to go horribly wrong...Steven Spielberg once again proves himself one of the masters of such entertainment, giving it a true sense of grandeur, with excellent location shooting in Hawaii and the Dominician Republic, impressive production design by Rick Carter, and effective cinematography by old pro Dean Cundey. John Williams gives the production another of his anthemic and rousing scores. Admittedly the story takes its time to really get going, but it emerges a grabber, with the tyrannosaurus rex and the velociraptors becoming true forces to be reckoned with. The dinosaurs are brought to convincing life using a variety of practical and digital effects, utilizing the talents of such gentlemen as Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Phil Tippett, and Michael Lantieri.The actors display just the right amount of awe & wonder and subsequently apprehension and real fear, and the spectacle thankfully never overwhelms their efforts; Goldbum is priceless in his typical fashion as a charismatic eccentric; also among the well chosen supporting cast are Bob Peck as game warden Muldoon, Martin Ferrero as the lawyer Gennero, B.D. Wong as a scientist, and Samuel L. Jackson and the scene stealing Wayne Knight as other park personnel. And just as the actors show that awe & wonder, so too will the audience feel those emotions; there is real movie making magic on display here.Any kid *or* adult who's ever felt a fascination for the extinct animals of Earths' past will be pleased with the results. And the message about the nature and folly of man trying to ""play God"", as it were, often a recurring theme in fantastic cinema, comes across here in high style. Very well done overall.Nine out of 10.","

"anaconda-40658","25 June 2015","Jurassic Park (1993): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Cast: Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Wayne Knight: Breakthrough film for director Steven Spielberg who brings prehistoric creatures to life in what can only be described as a brilliant technical advancement. The title represents the old and the new where Richard Attenborough establishes a theme park where dinosaurs roam wild thanks to cloning prehistoric D.N.A. He brings in a research team, most of whom will become lunch to creatures unimagined. Inappropriate marketing to families featuring frightening and graphic scenes. Great concept with heart pounding suspense and a triumphant climax. The cast mainly play out characters whom are nothing more than what's on the menu. Sam Neill is strong in his position of protecting two children as well as present narrative insight. Laura Dern plays the second smartest character in her search and rescue attempts as well as struggle with the power. Jeff Goldblum as a mathematician is given funny lines but illogical decisions that land him an injury. Attenborough's theme park owner is a joke and really needs heavy medicine and psychiatry. Wayne Knight plays a villain who makes a failed attempt to steal the DNA. Spielberg created broader characters in Jaws, however this still remains a landmark film that excels in brilliant technical advancement. Score: 8 ½ / 10","

"jldmp1","5 June 2006","We knew going into this there would be little to kindle the intellect -- Spielberg is only interested in stories that can be explained in comic book panels...There's not much cinematic originality either, CGI notwithstanding. The primary visual element here is 'the hand' -- Spielberg's mainstay.Everything is told through borrowings from other movies, mainly ""King Kong"" (from the first remake in '76), ""Jaws"" (the raptor pen), ""Aliens""(the kitchen evasion and the dropped ceiling escape). Heck, even ""Crocodile Dundee"" makes an appearance.So back to the intellect - Spielberg's in way over his head when he attempts to explicate chaos theory; Crichton's parallel novel is better for this, if that interests you. Essentially, all complex systems must eventually behave unpredictably. The thing is, Spielberg never attempts anything complex, and never lets anything out of the control of the guiding hand...he just tries to purport the illusion of complexity: the flea circus writ large.The entire movie is mirrored by the tour's animated DNA cartoon -- all of the content is meant for the consumption of mental ten year olds.Malcolm is presented with the proper cerebral depth in the novel; Goldblum knows this is a joke, so he plays this as the comic relief. He's the only real fun here.","

"kimcoxmonm","2 August 2021","I love the Netflix series and it was wonderful that in season 3, they included this movie in the 4 icons featured. It also includes ""Forrest Gump"", ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Back To The Future"". Yes, I'm going to give a review within a review.The Netflix series is a must watch. I've seen so many behind the scenes on many movies but this goes as far back as concept and preproduction in actually getting movie from the infancy of the idea through it's finished product. It talks to those involved in making the movie, producers, directors, DOCs, special and visual effects, writers, etc who examine all the work that goes into creating a film and shows footage of the actual work. It's fascinating. Plus when you hear things from the horses' mouths, you realize that alot of the trivia you read is, well, not quite on the mark at times. Then again, I take some of it with a cautious eye, especially when you see several versions of the same topic.I have enjoyed Jurassic Park and it's sequels over the years many times over. I'm looking forward to the forthcoming sequel slated for 2022. Who doesn't love dinosaurs!! There have been many scientific discoveries and theories in paleontology in the the nearly 30 years since the movie came out. This franchise could go on for a long time due to new science being incorporated into the movies.In reading that the beloved main characters from the original are coming back ( hopefully in more than a cameo as a ploy to ramp up interest and ticket sales) would add depth to the story. The original team revisiting the wonders and then the horrors they experienced 30 years prior and it's emotional impact along with the changes that took place over the years. I'm excited for it.Is it the greatest movie ever made? No, there are far better but far more are worse. Spielberg has made better movies and some clunkers. Are the special effects great? For the time, yes. There were novel effects that changed the course of movie making and commonplace today. There are movies now that have big budgets and can still have so-so or poor CGI. The script has flaws but many great movies have a stinker or two. There were changes from the source material which is typical. As an example: they use ""Mr. DNA"" as a filler for exposition. It's a quirky juxtaposition from the movies tone, but funny. Great novels can't always be translated to a visual medium. Liberties are taken to accommodate the running time, the flow of the story and,many times, the movie makers vision. Heck, there are times when an author will admit they wished they had come up with something in the screenplay. And finally, the science. Come on people, it's a work of fiction based on theory. Again, think of the discoveries that have refuted science at the time the movie was made. Even in the novel, Crichton has admitted to errors and even those are based on what the scientists think, not know. It's a science fiction thriller not a documentary. Sure, there are mistakes made. Every movie has them. Unless they are blatant errors you can see, the rest.....I don't want to watch a movie frame by frame to pick out an insignificant boo-boo. It's entertainment and an escape. Those who nitpick every little mistake made is not really taking it all in they way it's meant to be. Get over yourself!! Your opinion is yours and it's on an internet movie site. These reviews are all virtual ephemera. You're not going to make or break someone else's experience who has an open mind.For those few who bashed the hundreds who gave it high marks simply thinking they are stupid and have no clue about a good movie...well I couldn't even comprehend the ones with nonsensical writing and poo poo on those who live in the ""I'm above this type of drivel"". Aaaah, no your not.Yes, there is a moral...Greed and playing God will eat you alive. In this case, literally.Oh, by the way, if you haven't read the source material, Michael Crichton's novel ""Jurassic Park"", you're missing out.","

"dkncd","11 October 2007","""Jurassic Park"" is Steven Spielberg's immensely popular movie about a theme park with live dinosaurs made possible by replicating preserved dinosaur DNA. Through a calamity the dinosaurs escape their fenced confinements and run amok in the park. The park was created with impressive sets and scenes. John Williams' score is of the highest quality and greatly adds to the majesty and intensity of the film.On paper it sounds as though ""Jurassic Park"" could be just another ""monsters attack"" movie, but there are several factors that make this film far better than just another monster movie. There is some character development and importantly each part is perfectly cast, which means that each character makes a distinct impression and has memorable lines. Richard Attenborough is the perfect man to play the genial park owner John Hammond. The way Hammond mused about his dream of creating Jurassic Park even when the park was in shambles was great. Sam Neill and Laura Dern were apt choices to play the respectable paleontologists Drs. Grant and Sattler. Jeff Goldblum creates a memorable character in the eccentric Dr. Malcolm. I enjoyed seeing all of the characters in this film.Of course there are the film's famous dinosaurs, which are amazingly realistic. There is enough variation in the types of dinosaur encounters and the context in which they are encountered such that they don't become boring. The situations with the dinosaurs are created such that tension is created. ""Jurassic Park"" manages to rise far above being simply another monster movie.","

"BenjaminPopkin","30 March 2022","""What do you call a blind dinosaur?"" ""do-you-think-he-saurus""I remember when I was really young I used to be absolutely terrified of this movie.This film is honestly near perfect. The practical effects still hold up even though some of the CGI doesn't. Regardless, the film looks great. The practical effects and the use of the animatronics are some of my favorite special effects work I've seen in any film.John Williams is honestly the best music composer on the planet. Nothing he makes doesn't sound beautiful, and his score for this film is breathtaking and I can listen to it on a daily basis. I also always think of Universal Studios when I hear it.All the actors do great and deliver memorable performances which is why this film is as popular and as great as it is. There are so many memorable quotes, the film is so quotable. The film feels like it never drags and there is always something going on, the pacing is perfect. With different actors it just couldn't be the same (like Star Wars, Harry Potter, Avengers, etc). But no surprise Jeff Goldblum gives the best performance in the entire film. The man deserves an Oscar for this tbh. He doesn't even have to try, a breathing legend.Overall, I believe that Jurassic Park is a masterpiece in storytelling and filmmaking. From the sound to the production design to the special effects, screenplay, acting, and all the iconic shots and memorable moments. (welcome to Jurassic park scene, water shaking, trex, kitchen scene, jello shaking, etc). This film not only gets everything right but is also one of the most influential films in cinema when it comes to special effects. This film is a masterpiece *chefs kiss* I've seen it 50 times and I will rewatch it more over and over again for years to come. It will never get old. Steven Spielberg really ""paid no expense.""

"Garcwrites","4 June 2015","Jurassic Park starts off with a glimpse of the danger the dinosaur represents then introduces the characters and the park. The park is first showcased as potential visitors would discover it, they see the dinosaurs, then learn how they're made, before everything start to go awry.The film plays with our fears of the unseen because in a good portion of it we don't actually see the scary dinosaurs being scary. We hear them, we know they are lurking off camera but we don't actually see them. It's such a good build up that when we see ""the monsters"" it's scary. My heart was racing like the little child I was when I first saw it. The suspense is one of the things that get you, even more than the few jump scares the movie has.Watching Jurassic Park now made me realize how smart the plot is. lt plays on concerns people would have if this park was really about to open. Some characters only have dollar signs in their eyes and others see it as something incredible that can turn deadly, which it does but it doesn't take away from the fact that it could be wonderful.The special effects in this film look as good now as they were when the movie first came out. My guess is that they used a lot of practical effects, animatronics and great camera shots to make us believe that these dinosaurs are real. It thought me that even the most incredible things can be dangerous.Jurassic Park is such a good movie, it was for a long time the closest thing to an horror movie that I could watch. The film is great fun and very much enjoyable now. @wornoutspines","

"ElMaruecan82","7 March 2019","So many contrasts cohabite in ""Jurassic Park"", prehistoric relics and living dinosaurs, living dinosaurs and men's technology, men's technology and their total disregard for nature, the culminating point of the homo (not-so) sapiens and the downfall caused by his hubris. So in a man's creation that couldn't possibly go wrong, we have another man's creation bound to fail... with extreme prejudice.Indeed, as the film's arc quote says ""life will find a way"", but once you give life that little impulse, it might come hand in hand with death, as part of its great cycle. And dinosaurs might simply remind men that they can be God, but they can be dinner as well. That's why 65 million years separate us from our reptilian ancestors. Men could deal with lions, tigers and bears, but dinosaurs, oh, my!But that didn't affect the enthusiasm of John Hammond portrayed by the unforgettable Richard Attenborough. Hammond is an eccentric businessman with such dangerous ideas they fall into the mad scientist trope, a mix of Willy Wonka (for the cane and the dreamy location), Dr. Moreau (for the Island and the dangerous implications) and Colonel Sanders (for the white suit, the elderly gentleman manners and the cunning business sense). But don't get it wrong, Hammond is a small player compared to his real-life counterpart Spielberg who spared no expenses to make the title work better than the park itself, generating almost a billion dollar of profit out of 65 million dollars for marketing, starting with the number itself.It's jut as if there was something coming full circle in the history of evolution, in the name of science and Spielberg's fascination for the little ideas that grow into visual wonders and challenges for Hollywood craftsmanship. ""Jurassic Park"" is in fact Spielberg coming full circle with his own career evolution, two decades after his groundbreaking ""Jaws"". There's no doubt that it was Spielberg and only Spielberg who was capable to make such a film, Michael Crichton wrote and conceived the idea but Spielberg made it a universally acclaimed family-friendly blockbuster and the landmark that redefined film-making and started the digital revolution.With the same ""J"", ""Jurassic Park"" is the ""Jaws"" of the nineties ensuring a smooth transition from practical to computer-aided effects. In the make-it-or-break-it moment of the film, when Sam Neil and Laura Dern (playing a couple of paleontologists) discover the real attraction of the park, their dropped jaws echo our own wonder, Neil's tears looked like what could've been George Melies' reaction had he seen how far cinema went. And that these effects still hold up today is a tribute to the perfectionism of Spielberg.Spielberg who, by the way, was still capable to direct ""Schindler's List"" while supervising this project from Poland. Maybe the former was too personal a movie it could only force him to take the latter as personally on a technical level... and with a more business-driven hindsight. After all, if it's any consolation for Spielberg's detractors, the film also betrays his own hubris: you can't help but spot the Spielberg's self-awareness in that shot of ""Jurassic Park"" merchandising shop.But can we blame him? This is the man who made the ultimate thriller with ""Jaws"", the ultimate family film ""E.T."", both became the highest grossing movies of their time. Spielberg combined the two, he made a thriller that could attract children with a minimal parental guidance, ""Jurassic Park"" became the highest-grossing movie of all time before ""Titanic"". So this was his momentum, in 1993, Spielberg also director of the Best Picture winner, was the King of the World. And the king of action movies as well.The action sequences utilize mechanisms inherited from Hitchcock like the race against the clock with a kid climbing down a temporarily deactivated electric fence and the gears being switched on, or taken from ""Jaws"", the suggestion of the T-rex' presence through the infamous shaking glass of water. For a film that prepares us so much to a monster movie, the writers' imagination created moments of pure ingenuousness and managed to turn the most mundane places such as cars or kitchens into deadly traps. But while ""Jaws"" had a no-holds-barred rule, Spielberg knew very well a 90s audience wasn't ready to see kids serving as appetizers (still, he didn't turn them into these 1970s know-it-all brats).So the film also works in spite of its relative predictability. As groundbreaking and powerful as it is, it is also symptomatic of the trend of the 90s where we know the characters who are likely to survive and save the day thanks to aforementioned skills. Spielberg doesn't make his cast nonentities and allows them to share their views about recreating life but subtlety isn't his strongest suit. While Goldblum plays the most interesting character as the chaos theorist insisting that whatever can go wrong will go wrong, Sam Neil's disliking of kids (set in a distasteful opening scene) seemed far fetched and only there for a needless arc, the kids in the film were nice enough and and he had great chemistry with them.But these considerations hardly matter when the real star are the special effects and the dinosaurs. Forget the blatant lack of security, the improbable survivals or the contrived ending, Spielberg knew people didn't watch a film like screenwriting students, his common denominator instinct paid off. He knew we would all be at the edge of our seat when the T-Rex pops up and we would all go ""aaaw"" with the brachiosaurus or the baby dinosaur. Spielberg was a visionary showman like Hammond, but HE left nothing to chance.I remember I was eleven when I participated to a game show and one of the questions I got was ""which animals are featured in ""Jurassic Park""?"" (I hadn't seen the film yet but no one could miss the movie, its poster and the whole publicity around it) the film was undeniable in 1993 and is still today.","

One is a paleontologist (played by Sam Neill), a paleobotanist (played by Laura Durin) his own layer who will get eaten by a T-Rex on a toilet and of course the koe Shane played by Jeff Goldblum. So when entering a private tour of the park they see the magic and wonders that await them like the Brachiosaurus, the Triceratops, hatching baby Raptors and of course a Tyrannosaurus Rex. But things didn't go too well with the park when one of the employees (played by Wayne Knight) steals the dinosaur embryos for another company and powers down the park, leaving our heroes to be fast food for all the dinosaurs.It's one of my favorite movies and this is the film that got me into dinosaurs. I was a dinosaur fan after this, I looked at every book, every film and I looked at pretty much anything having to do with dinosaurs.Aside from the characters, the dinosaurs are absolutely awesome, most of all the T-Rex and I couldn't get enough of it. But then of course there's the scary velociraptors, they're like reptilian lions and they're very smart.Overall this is greatest movie of the 90s and my opinion is Steven Spielberg's masterpiece.A solid 10/10.","

"southdavid","24 June 2022","Preparation for ""Dominion"" actually started a few weeks ago, with a rewatch of all the films leading up to it, beginning, of course with an undisputed classic.Having used pioneering scientific techniques to resurrect living, breathing dinosaurs John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) brings in a team of scientists to sign off of the viability of his park, built on a remote Costa Rican island. The tour though is struck by disaster as a tropical storm hits just as a disgruntled employee, Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) turns off the power to some security measures. As dinosaurs, particularly carnivorous ones, get lose the remaining humans try to get the park back online and to not get eaten.""Jurassic Park"" is one of those films that has transferred into legend. I don't think I'll ever actually need to watch it again, as so much of it, the action scenes and the lines of dialogue are permanently engrained on my memory. Even the ""goofs"" have been poured over so extensively that there's not really anything new I can add there.The CGI effects still look really good, though it's the model and puppeteering work that really has the film continuing to look so strong. John Wiliams score is iconic, there really is no other word for it and its main suite is one of cinemas most recognisable pieces. I like the performances and respect the decision to use 'actors' rather than 'moviestars' in a tentpole production.If, for some unfathomable reason, you're reading this review having not seen ""Jurassic Park"" then, even though I'd agree that it's slightly underwritten, it is one of the most thrilling movie experiences that Spielberg, or even Hollywood, have ever produced.","

"m_madhu","25 September 2001","In 1993, nothing - and i mean nothing, was bigger than Jurassic Park. Justly too. what a thrill this was. not a single flaw and all the grandeur & wonder that you can ask for. a scientific fantasy epic that only one man could have delivered - Steven Spielberg.Jurassic Park ofcourse was later tarnished as being a cheap bag of thrills. well - woe unto thee who ill-talk this wonderful bag of ... oh!! well - thrills!!Many complain that the movie never did justice to the tremendous detail in the book. but then thats only to be expected. what would have remained an imaginary world was brought to visual delight by the magic of spielberg. a visual delight for the family. with lots of thrills. boy!! do i love them or do i love them??the sense of awe that first filed me when my eyes set on those magnificent dinosaurs was extraordinary (remember i was 14 then). Jurassic park is a movie for the kids and in a typical spielberg fashion, a special delight fo the adults that accompany them. im sure id love to watch the movie again now. as much as JP2 & JP3 have disappointed me, nothing can take away the special fondness for JP1.a stunning 9","

"bensonmum2","27 October 2017","I'll keep this brief as there are a million articles/reviews on Jurassic Park spread across the internet that are better written and more intelligent than anything I could ever hope to come up with. And forget about a plot summary. If you're not familiar with the plot of Jurassic Park, stop reading my drivel and go check it out right now. As my rating clearly indicates, I love this film. The word ""classic"" gets thrown around too easily when describing movies. But here it's deserved. Jurassic Park truly is a modern classic. It's family/action/popcorn filmmaking at its finest. It's hard to believe that Jurassic Park is almost 25 years old. I remember seeing it in the theaters and being completely blown away by the special effects. They were simply stunning. More amazingly, however, is how well the effects hold-up. I hadn't seen it in several years, but I watched it the other night with my 5 year-old. This was a first time viewing for him and I'm happy to say he's now a fan. When the first dinosaurs came on screen, I could see he was filled with the same excitement and amazement that I was in 1993. The CGI here is as good as any movie I've ever seen. While CGI may have become more common, I think filmmakers have gotten lazy. In too many modern movies, the CGI is obviously CGI. Here, everything looks ""real"". They took the time and spent the money to get it right. And the mix of computer effects with puppetry is pretty much seamless. I may not care for everything he's made, but I'll give Steven Spielberg credit here. He took an unbelievable premise and turned it into a very believable world. Jurassic Park is pure movie magic.","

"matrixdukenukem","18 October 2021","It's 2021 and it's the age of super hero movies with greatest visual spectacles and world's biggest blockbusters have released in last couple of years. I am here to tell you that this is one of those movies that stands tall as a thrilling entertainer and people are still holding this as benchmark for visual effects, sound design and production design. If you're reading this in 2031 chances are this film making is still being taught in film schools and people are still yearning for practical effects of this manner.This movie is childhood adventure, horror and fantasy of many like me who would pick this movie as one of the firsts to show to their grandkids. Though it's not as electrifying in pop culture as star wars or lord of the rings, it's still up there with one of the best monster movies of all time. Dr. Ian Malcom's shirtless resting pose has many droolers and Dr. Grant as well as Dr. Sattler have inspired many young minds to pursue archeology or paleontology. There are still dads making 'spared no expense' jokes at various events and John Williams score still gives the goosebumps.Steven Spielberg has directed many movies before and after this. But to me this movie is his legacy. No I am not saying this is his best film. But when someone says Spielberg, the first word I think of is Jurassic and then ET, Saving private Ryan, Jaws, Schindler's list ....This is a near perfect movie in every sense and I have always wanted one of those night vision goggles. I wish someone remasters it or re-releases it in theatres of my city. I know me and people of my age would pay the admission to relive their childhood.","

"Robert_duder","20 August 2008","It's true that few people can create a visual story and spectacle like Stephen Spielberg. I can almost remember seeing Jurassic Park as a kid in the movie theatre for the first time and if you asked me then if I liked it I probably would have told you that it was the greatest movie I had ever seen and meant it. Years later, seeing it again, it has perhaps some of that youthful exuberance I once felt for it but that doesn't make it any less powerful and brilliant and wonderfully created. I think just seeing the film outside of a movie theatre takes away some of the magic because the dinosaurs just aren't as enormous and terrifying and jaw dropping as they are on a 200 foot movie screen. Still I did pick Jurassic Park to be the first movie I watched on my beloved new 42 Inch Plasma which helped a great deal. The characters are intricately created and you become enthralled in their adventure. Spielberg has always had a way of making characters come to life and you become completely attached to them which makes the story even better. On top of that Jurassic Park coins the thrill a minute phrase giving you a non stop jaw dropping riveting story about action and danger and of course dinosaurs of all kinds. The film is just quite simply a modern day classic. One of my favourite scenes in movie history is the scene with the Tyrannasaurus Rex attacking the jeep for the first time with Tim trapped inside. That scene has stayed with me for years along with the Raptors in the kitchen later on in the film. The movie is not soft enough for really little kids but it's not too edgy for the pre-teen/teen crowd but definitely edgy and intelligent enough for any adult or movie lover to watch again and again.Jurassic Park started me on a brief love affair with Sam Neill. His dry and often snarly performance as Dino genius Dr. Allan Grant was perfect. I think his performances in other films as well as this one could be interpreted as an acquired taste but there is something just perfect about the way he interacts with the cast and the script for the movie. Laura Dern is also good as Ellie Sattler. Although she wasn't my favourite character she added a tone of emotion and a strong female lead and had good chemistry with Neill. Jeff Goldblum was just terrific, possibly one of his best roles as he too tends to be an acquired taste, as Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician who warns right from the beginning of playing God. Goldblum is level headed and definitely delivers some of the best lines in the film as the comic relief in a serious deadpan kind of way. Legendary actor Richard Attenborough returned to acting after fifteen years away to portray Billionaire John Hammond, the creator and mastermind of Jurassic Park. He is terrific in many ways and just really captures the character and his conflict with what he's created. Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards play Tim and Lexi Murphy, Hammond's grandkids. Both are terrific and really capture the teen audience very well and have some really hair raising scenes. Neither of them unfortunately went on to much else but they were terrific in this film. One of the most under used characters that I really thought could have also been a leading role was Bob Peck who played Robert Muldoon. He had a mysterious hero quality about him and I really wanted to see more of him as he ended up facing his greatest fears in the raptors when they escape. He was terrific in the small role he was given. The top notch supporting cast is also amazing including the legendary Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, B.D. Wong, and Martin Ferrero as the ""blood sucking lawyer"" as Hammond refers to him.This is just one of those films, especially by Spielberg that was destined to be a classic and it is one you can watch over and over again which I have done frequently. The movie has an amazing story, riveting action and everything that makes an epic film amazing. Perhaps they dropped the ball by serializing the films (although the second book by Creighton was amazing) and I will get to reviewing the sequels too but no matter how you look at it, the first Jurassic Park is a movie that every single person must see period. 10 out of 10***Update*** Had the amazing opportunity to see Jurassic Park in its (unfortunately 3D) Re-release. While the 3D changed nothing and wasn't even that impressive, seeing the movie on the big screen was amazing...again. I even got a little bit emotional seeing a few of the scenes again that shaped my movie going as a youngster. This movie is still a modern day epic classic.","

"zkonedog","11 March 2017","The concept behind ""Jurassic Park"" is an absolute slam-dunk: realistic dinosaurs on the big screen. One could get people in theater seats with that conceit alone (see: all the sequels after this one). Fortunately, ""Jurassic Park"" has Steven Spielberg at the helm, turning it into an all-time classic because, simply, everything works.For a basic plot summary, ""Jurassic Park"" sees billionaire mogul John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) build an amusement park housing eight species of dinosaurs. However, in order to get the corporate ""O.K"" on the whole project, Hammond calls in scientists Alan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to put the place through a fine-tooth comb from a biological perspective. During the grand tour (and largely due to some corporate intrigue), the park is completely shut down, leaving all the electric fences unwired and setting up a struggle between species that were never meant to interact.First and foremost, this is an action/adventure flick of the highest order. The 1993 graphics still measure up to anything that has been produced today, and all of the action sequences are breathtaking--you'll be on the edge of your seat.What really makes ""Jurassic Park"" an out-and-out classic, though, is that Spielberg works so much more into the picture other than ""dinosaurs running around"".For example:-The philosophical ""man vs nature"" undertones are perfectly examined.
-A plot line involving Dr. Grant's loathing of children pays off repeatedly.
-One of the kids' computer ""hacking"" skills pays off in the end.
-Some of Spielberg's tongue-in-cheek comedy can be seen from time to time, providing some much-needed moments to exhale before the ""next big thing"" happens.The visuals and instrumental score further cement ""Jurassic Park"" in the pantheon of the greats. The cinematography is incredible throughout. It's impressive nearly 30 years after its release--I can't imagine what audiences would have thought of it in '93. There are also some really inventive shots near the end that wowed me. All the while, John Williams does his ""genius thing"" and ends up with a score that has become as iconic as any of his others (and that's saying something!)Overall, this is a film that delivers in all important departments: effects, action, plot, characters, visuals, & sound. Plus, thanks to the ""Spielberg touch"", it holds up to repeat viewings flawlessly.","

"gottogorunning","13 August 2005","This movie was really great. Don't get me wrong. I loved it. But I really think the first half of this could have been A LOT better. The action doesn't even start until an hour of viewing. But what follows is absolutely terrific. It scares you at times when dinos pop out of nowhere and it is one f/x movie that people really liked. Most movies of this kind (Independence Day, Godzilla, Armageddon, etc. Which I liked ALL of) are movies that don't really please like this movie. It's got really smart action sequences and fairly good acting but I think they should have used more popular stars, but you mostly concentrate on the dinosaurs, which do good acting jobs. I thought they would have been nominated for Best Actresses. The f/x are another thing. They look really good! Only if the first half was more exciting but oh well. The rest of the movie makes up for that mistake. That leaves one more thing. The sequel. I thought the sequel was top notch. It was even better than this movie. In my opinion, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is just slightly better than the first because it starts out with more action. That's unlikely for sequels. Watch them both. They will be remembered for generations. Until they become extinct. Or when the next blockbuster hits with great f/x and good script. Crowd-pleaser's are so hard to find these days, aren't they?","

"TheMovieDiorama","24 February 2018","Folks, they do not come better than this. This was the game changer. The pinnacle of entertainment for future Hollywood blockbusters. Spielberg crafted what is now one of the most quotable, memorable and revolutionary films of all time. You cannot deny the staying power that Jurassic Park has. A group of scientists are invited to an island theme park where dinosaurs have been genetically modified and cloned. A storm approaches, one employee decides to steal and in doing so shuts down the park's computer security systems. You know what that means...enter the Tyrannosaurus Rex! Everyone has pretty much seen this, there really is nothing I can add to the appeal. It's a perfectly structured narrative where the first half builds the characters (in order to prevent them from being just expendable assets) which leads to a thrilling second half where they must escape. One scene turns the film from a family adventure to a terrifying thriller, the T-Rex. It's sheer animatronic perfection. The stature, the colossal size and detailed craft creates a magnitude of awe. Quite literally blown away when it roars through your sound system, it gets me every time. The visual effects were revolutionary and would provide a bench mark for future films. The acting was solid all round, Sam Neill and Laura Dern's chemistry felt natural. Jeff Goldblum is a marvel and Richard Attenborough is Jurassic Park, wouldn't be the same without him. Spielberg's electrifying direction comes to no surprise for anyone. He is the ultimate ""event director"". Dinosaur POV shots to tracking shots outside the jeeps He really does know how to conjure up a magical adventure, always has done. Bear in mind this is a PG, some of the scenes actually scarred me as a child. The T-Rex casually devouring a lawyer and the velociraptor grotesquely ravaging an innocent. Some would say Jurassic Park is the definitive blockbuster, to which I agree. Jurassic Park...""Welcome, to the perfect rating club""! Queue John Williams' amazing score (that theme tune is perfection)...","

"Anonymous_Maxine","30 August 2000","This is the best dinosaur movie that has ever been made. Maybe a better one will be released sometime in the future, but so far, Jurassic Park is unparalleled. The story involves the re-creation of actual living dinosaurs from their own DNA which was recovered from dinosaur blood remaining inside a prehistoric mosquito which, millions of years ago, was unlucky enough to get caught in the soon solidified sap of a tree. Even all of the scientific elements of the story are explained in a way that even the youngest viewers could understand. Jurassic Park, However, is not just about making dinosaurs and then getting eaten by them, it is about what happens when humans play with life and try to re-make and contain it in ways that were never meant to be. Dinosaurs once ""ruled the earth,"" but the earth is now ruled by humans, and the two species, separated by millions of years of evolution, cannot coexist. Neither can contain the other, one is sure to overcome.
The spectacular visuals and amazingly convincing special effects and make-up provide an absolutely incredible cinematic experience. Never have dinosaurs been so convincingly made on screen. The fact that the dinosaurs were so real allowed for the film to really keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Particularly memorable moments include a velociraptor jumping up and almost out of the screen as it tries to get Alexis (Adriana Murphy) as she climbs up into the ceiling to escape, and also a scene with a Tyranosaurus in the rear-view mirror of the fleeing humans' Jeep(imitated hilariously in the great Toy Story 2). However, even though the special effects have the rare combination of being both overpowering and amazingly convincing, Jurassic Park had a good number of important messages to deliver. There were a lot of things that could be learned from this film, and many of them were put right into the dialogue, mostly that of Dr. Ian Malcolm, played wonderfully by Jeff Goldblum. Michael Crichton needs to be recognized for his brilliant creation of such a man as Ian Malcolm, talking understandably about chaos theory and scientific responsibility and the extremely important fact that ""life finds a way."" Sam Neill also delivers one of the highlight performances of his career as the wonderfully convincing Dr. Alan Grant, alongside Laura Dern as Ellie Satler, and both of them, along with the rest of the cast, were perfectly faithful to the original novel. That, in my opinion, is an extremely important element of films that were adapted from books, and Jurassic Park is rivaled in its literary faith only by other great films like The Green Mile.
Jurassic Park is not a film about a dinosaur amusement park. That is the premise, but the message of the film has a lot to say about the vulnerability of the human race, and it is a testament to the skills of Steven Spielberg and the other filmmakers involved that they were able to make a movie with such an important thing like that to say (among others), while at the same time making the whole experience so much fun.","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","19 April 2017","The movie that heralded the coming of the digital era, ""Jurassic Park"" changed blockbuster filmmaking, a phrase that had been said many times before, unsurprisingly, about films directed and/or produced by Steven Spielberg in the '70s and '80s.""Jurassic Park"" was the perfect film for Spielberg to make: The fear and man-eating creatures of ""Jaws;"" the adventure, history and science of the ""Indiana Jones"" movies; and the family-friendly fun and wonder of ""E.T."" The fodder of Michael Crichton's novel, which he helped adapt for the screen with David Koepp, had the broad appeal studios can only dream of, and few directs had made such broadly appealing films as Spielberg.The film's computer-generated imaging (CGI) holds up surprisingly well nearly 25 years later, but perhaps that credit belongs more to the story and to Spielberg, who knows how to put viewers into a big- screen moment. The first scene with the tyrannosaurus rex and the characters stuck in the 4x4s is still one of the best blockbuster movie scenes ever committed to film. The sense of danger is palpable and Spielberg draws it out with pure mastery from the water rippling in the cup down to the characters' narrow escape. If the dino had been entirely animatronic, it still would've worked; the CGI made it all the more believable.Spielberg also knows how to create a sense of wonder, punctuated by his many collaborations with theme-driven composer John Williams. The way the movie fills you with childlike awe at what it would be like to see a real-life dinosaur and then pivots into monster horror is nothing short of remarkable. It's hard to accomplish one or the other, and rare to do both with seamless aplomb. ""Jurassic Park"" doesn't have the best characters. Even Sir Richard Attenborough in a rare on-camera appearance as park creator John Hammond is missing a degree of complexity despite the opportunity of portraying a hybrid of Walt Disney and Victor Frankenstein. Mostly, these characters are stand-ins for us. It's not a movie about their stories or who they are, but about their experience in the park, their reactions and emotions. Rarely is that enough to carry a film, but it does.The truth is that ""Jurassic Park"" transcends traditional notions of film and enters the realm of experiential cinema, something in between a movie and a theme park ride, which is fitting for a movie about a theme park. James Cameron is the only other director capable of making these kinds of movies, and it's no surprise he tried to get the rights. All this to say, transplanting audiences into visual theme park ride of a movie isn't easy and is part of what makes ""Jurassic Park"" so entertaining and timeless. Even some of the most outdated theme park rides are fun, and this ride isn't getting any less so. Despite the countless films that have bombarded audiences with CGI (including 2015's ""Jurassic World""), ""Jurassic Park"" is better than most of them. Released today, it would be more of a very good film rather than a great one because the visual splendor of seeing this in 1993 was exponentially more incredible, but Spielberg's ability to create a real proximity to what's happening on screen is something a lot of movies fail at or don't even bother to do. It preserves ""Jurassic Park"" as a unique experience. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more","

"abcvision","2 April 2013","I remember attending the first screening for Jurassic Park in the 90s and there was much hype about this bigger than life theatrical experience. 20 years later it seems like a time capsule from the 90s. The 3D experience does enhance a few scenes but overall the movie seems a bit dated. Interesting about all these movies in the past that were look into the future missed the entire cell phone craze. Some of the scenes where DNA sequences are manipulated have turned into true modern science. Our expectations are more than was delivered in the special effects but it was nostalgic to catch glimpses of these young stars, especially a very young Samuel Jackson. The movie is about the ultimate theme park composed of Dinosaurs but oh no suddenly something goes wrong. Based on a novel by Michael Crichton and is produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald Molen and directed by Stephen Spielberg. So if you want a trip to the 90s with funky colored glasses then this is the movie for you.","

"fernandoschiavi","13 June 2020","The adaptation for the big screen was made by David Koepp with the collaboration of Michael Crichton himself. Koepp left out much of the exposure of romance and violence and made numerous changes to the characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii. Some differences between the book and the film, for example, are that in the original script, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) were combined into a single character, and Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck) survived in the end. In the book, Gennaro and Muldoon survive, and John Hammond and Malcolm die. Despite these differences, the adaptation managed to capture the essence of the original work and Spielberg seems to have been the right director for the job, considering the filmmaker's ability to move between so many genres of the seventh art, always leaving his mark. In Jurassic Park, the director gets it right when delivering a science fiction that brings an exciting adventure, with many touches of comedy (personified mainly in the character of Ian Malcolm) and, at the same time, having all the foundation on the basis of a suspense very well built through a somewhat claustrophobic environment giving the impression that the characters were in fact at risk of life because they were in an isolated place and surrounded by imposing and hungry dinosaurs. Most of the scenes filmed at night and in the rain, make everything even more threatening, increasing even more the suspense of ""where will the next attack come from? "". The film manages to leave everyone watching it on the edge of the chair all the time. Another curiosity is that with more than two hours in duration, Jurassic Park has only 15 minutes of filming with ""real"" dinosaurs, nine minutes from Stan Winston's animatronics and six minutes through CGI (Computer Graphics).Much of the film's success is due to its cast. Ian Malcolm, in a fun and charming interpretation of Jeff Goldblum. The character had a certain importance in the novel, but gains a new face in the feature film. So much so that Malcolm had his fatal fate in literature reversed by Crichton, who loved the changes and made him the protagonist in the sequel, The Lost World (1997). Sam Neill and Laura Dern also attract attention with their performances, but end up being eclipsed by Goldblum and, of course, Richard Attenborough, who gives a lot of charisma to the owner of the park, John Hammond. The children Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards are excellent. Even with the basic function of just running and screaming from dinosaurs, young people do well and manage to show fear and develop a loving relationship with Dr. Grant making a great trio.
Although it is based on a successful book signed by Michael Crichton, Jurassic Park: The Park of the Dinosaurs is, without a doubt, a work by Steven Spielberg. Some themes dear to the filmmaker are present in the feature film, more precisely Alan Grant's paternal ineptitude, observed in several previous works by the director, such as Immediate Third Degree Contacts (1977), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) and Hook (1991). Sam Neill's character hates children and cannot see himself as a future father. Until he meets the grandchildren of John Hammond, Tim and Lex, with whom he has an unfriendly beginning, giving in over time to the sympathy and the need of those children for a figure to protect them. Grant becomes a father figure when he realizes that the responsibility for those ""children"" is greater than any previously established disability. Another curious point is the criticism of unbridled scientific advances. At one point, Ian Malcolm (probably the best character in the film) observes that John Hammond park scientists abuse ""mother nature"", so concerned that they would be able to bring the dinosaurs back to life that they ended up not thinking if they should, at first place. Alan Grant and Ellie Satler join the chorus of doubts, agreeing that the dinosaur habitat had been extinct 65 million years ago and that it was not possible to predict what to expect from this new moment. In a world in which we see successful sheep cloning and where stem cell experiments are still controversial, it is still healthy to observe this type of criticism in a large blockbuster like Jurassic Park.The special effects created to bring dinosaurs to life are incredible and, to this day, they can convince. The film was hailed as a milestone in the special effects industry, which were produced by Industrial Light & Magic (with effects created using computer graphics) and Stan Winston Studios (with effects produced using animatronics). The virtual reconstitution of the dinosaurs, so that they ""acted"" with the actors in the flesh, led to a resounding success at the box office, which only confirmed the fascination that these extinct creatures exert on people's imagination. Spielberg hired Stan Winston to create the animatronic dinosaurs, Phil Tippett to create dinosaurs in go motion for long shots, Michael Lantieri to oversee the interaction of these elements with actors and sets, and Dennis Muren to make the digital composition. Paleontologist Jack Horner oversaw the models, to fulfill Spielberg's desire to portray animals more as dinosaurs than monsters.For the filmmaker, it was very important not to just make a monster movie. To this end, Spielberg gives dinosaurs animal characteristics, obviously, but always with the clear intention of showing the instincts of a species that has been extinct for millions of years. So, in a more than right decision, dinosaurs are not just the villains of history. If the terrible velociraptors are the nemesis of humans on the loose in the park, it is only because of those animals' instinct to hunt. Just as it could be a lion or maybe a bear. In another idea worthy of applause, the Tyrannosaurus Rex that made the heroes of the story so much run for their lives, saves the skin of the protagonists by becoming the real hero of the film. Besides him, we see the velociraptors, portrayed as a secondary antagonist of the film, after Tyrannosaurus. Diloposaurus, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, Galimimo, and Parasaurolofo. Proceratosaurus, Stegosaurus and Metriacantosaurus do not appear in the film, but it is suggested that they are part of the attractions of the park, as their names are on the embryo storage tubes when Nedry steals some samples.In the 1990s, it is clear that the computing technologies we have today did not exist, making films with special effects much more challenging. The director and the production team should be very creative to create illusions that really convince the audience and don't sound silly. For that, several mechanical dolls were created in Jurassic Park - and for different types of dinosaurs. When they hear the sound of the T-Rex scream, the characters in the movies soon know that they are in very, very danger. To create this truly threatening roar, producers mixed several types of animal sounds, such as tigers, dogs, penguins, crocodiles and elephants, developing a unique roar that doesn't really exist in the natural world. Much of the realism of ""Jurassic Park"" can be credited to its sound depth. Not by chance, it was the first film to use the DTS (Digital Theater Systems) system, based on several audio channels. Spielberg, incidentally, was one of the format's investors in the 1990s.
Responsible for the special effects, Michael Lantieri considers that the most complicated effect was to make the water vibrate with the approach of the T-rex, since Spielberg wanted to announce his presence before his arrival. He placed a glass of water on top of a guitar and achieved the effect by pulling the strings on the instrument, which ended up being attached to the car panel to make the desired effect. It seems hard to believe, but the Velociraptors that appear in some scenes (especially those in the kitchen) are nothing more than animators wearing rubber suits. George Lucas worked on the post-production of the film. And it was by supervising this work that he was sure that the technology had already reached the level necessary to resume ""Star Wars"". The fourth film in the saga, ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"", was released in 1999.One cannot speak of Jurassic Park without mentioning yet another masterful work by master John Williams, composer of so many striking themes such as ""Star Wars (1977)"" and ""Superman (1978)"", for example. Here, we have a soundtrack that will always be one of the composer's most impressive masterpieces. Williams had the opportunity to combine each of his compositional styles prevalent in the 1990s into a single soundtrack. And in the process, he was able to create material with a magically cohesive core that is extremely powerful in the film.Speaking of Jurassic Park: Dinosaur Park is not easy. It may not be something complex like The Godfather, but it is an adventure classic (one of his greatest) and one of the films that represent the height of Steven Spielberg, which is enough praise and justification to put the film as a remarkable work. Oh, and on top of dinosaurs. In 1993 the Jurassic theme was inserted very firmly into pop culture, in a way that would change it completely. The work raised more than $ 914 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing film in history until the release of Titanic in 1997. It may not be taken as seriously as Schindler's List (1993) or The Rescue of the Soldier Ryan (1998), but it is a production with undeniable predicates, a blockbuster with content, based on the work of a best-selling writer who never offended the intelligence of his readers. What Spielberg does here is basically the same. It gives the general public a work that manages to be adventurous and smart at the same time, something that is not always present in Hollywood films aimed at massive audiences.","

"The_Void","24 October 2005","Like most kids back in 1993, I couldn't wait to see Jurassic Park. The fact that I was already interested in Dinosaurs made the film even more of a holy grail. Jurassic Park was the film that dreams were made of for yours truly, and despite my massively over-inflated expectations - the film really DID deliver. I saw it in cinema several times, and, at the time, couldn't ever see anything topping Jurassic Park. Of course, this was just the simple view of a child and, having seen many other films by now, as well as several subsequent viewings of this one; it's clear that this isn't the film that I once thought it was. But don't get me wrong - the fact that I now understand that films do indeed get better than this don't mean that Jurassic Park isn't a brilliantly well sculpted piece of entertainment. The plot is taken from the Michael Crichton book of the same title, and follows a new theme park, where the attractions are Dinosaurs. We follow a group made up of palaeontologists, other experts and the owner's children as they visit the park. Naturally, everything goes wrong and the lot of them are thrust into the world of the dinosaurs! Steven Spielberg can win a million Oscars for Schindler's List, but it doesn't change the fact that entertainment is his forte when it comes to film-making. The debate as to whether or not he's a great director can rage, but he definitely does know how to entertain if nothing else - and he shows that brilliantly with this film. The build up to the main action can be a little dull at times, but you're always on the edge of your seat due to the fact that you know it's not going to be all rosy. The film really comes together in the scene that sees the 'king' of the dinosaurs - the Tyrannosaurus Rex break free from it's cage. This scene is incredibly well directed - so much so that the rest of the movie never comes close to outdoing it. Spielberg tends to cast his movies with likable actors, and he's done that here. This does make the movie easy to like, but the resoundingly 'good' characters are often as flat as something that the T-Rex has stood on, and that doesn't do the movie any favours. I'm a big hater of CGI - except when it's done well, and I've got to say that it largely is here. Some scenes look very fake indeed, but the monster effects give it an old-school monster flick feel, and to be honest I'm glad that not all the dinosaurs look absolutely great. On the whole - this wont impress the people looking for great acting and the like; but Jurassic Park really is a first rate thriller, and if you like your films to be fun - you'll like Jurassic Park.","

"thinker1691","28 September 2013","From the creative and futurist mind of Michael Crichton comes this incredible and terrifying movie called "" Jurassic Park. "" Yet it took two exceptional directors, Steven Spielberg and George Lucus, to bring this imaginative story to life. The movie concerns an eccentric Billionaire named John Hammond, ( Richard Attenborough) who decides to buy an island off the coast of Costa Rico and build a huge enclosure for recreated Dinosaurs. When it's finished he invites the foremost authorities to endorse his park which include Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), a Palo-botanist, Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) a Chaos Theorist. The Zoo which Hammond creates for his attractions is a gigantic and impressive enclosure surrounded by electrified fences, automatic controls and computer protected alarms. So safe is the public that Hammond also invites his grand children. (Tim Murphy and Ariana Richards) However, no sooner does the grand opening tour begins, when things begin to malfunction. This sabotage is programed by one of the employees who is set to make a fortune by betraying his employer. The animals getting free is bad enough, but the terrifying ordeal has just begun, when the worst of the dinosaurs, the T-Rex is also set free. Horror gives way to terror when the children are preyed upon in the jungle tour, but they also have to race about in the open park, with all sorts of hungry creatures awaiting them. The movie is filled with frightening and terrifying scenes and only the screams of the audience is left within the walls of the theater. Samuel L. Jackson, BD Wong and Wayne Knight add credibility of this film which because of the Special Effects and enhanced modern CGI make's it a Classic for everyone. Easily recommend to all audiences. ****","

"PWNYCNY","13 November 2005","When I first watched this movie years ago, I didn't like it. I thought the movie was one big special-effects extravaganza with theatrical and uninspiring acting (except, of course, in the scene with the lawyer sitting on the toilet who's gobbled up by an out-of-control and hungry Tyrannosaurus Rex. I don't know if that scene was meant to be funny, but I recall that it provoked a certain amount of laughter.) Subsequently, I didn't give this movie a second thought. Then recently I happened to be watching television and lo-and-behold I switched to a channel that just happened to be showing Jurassic Park. So I watched the movie and this time I liked it. Indeed I thought this movie was great, and I'll tell you why. Despite the overblown special effects and contrived script and the almost laughable acting, especially by ""Newman"" from Jerry Seinfeld in one of the worst cases of miscasting in the history of movie making, this movie successfully and effectively deals with a serious theme - what happens when highly sensitive, highly experimental and potentially lethal scientific knowledge and technology gets into the hands of people who want to exploit this knowledge and technology for profit. This movie shows how the technology of cloning, when used irresponsibly and with little of any thought for possible consequences, can produce disastrous results, in this case, dinosaurs running amok with no way to control them. It seems far-fetched, but really no more so than the possibility of people being able to fly or communicate electronically over huge distances. It only seems far-fetched until it becomes a reality and then it's like it was always meant to be. But getting back to this movie, now that the dinosaurs are unleashed, the question is: how can they be controlled? They were supposed to be placed on display in a park, but it doesn't quite work out the way it was intended. Instead of the dinosaurs being confined, they literally go on a rampage, completely trash the park and in the process reveal a level of intelligence and cunning that is entirely unexpected, with dire consequences. The raptors, for instance, are not mere reptilian brutes but rather are cunning and highly intelligent creatures which makes them even more dangerous. And the humans who unleashed these creatures are simply no match for the ferociousness and strength of creatures that are now beyond all control. Compared to the dinosaurs the humans puny and helpless bystanders who are literally running for their lives when not caught and devoured. The humans' weapons are absolutely no match for the ferociousness of these creatures, who easily overpower and out-think the humans. The movie ends with the surviving humans getting out while they can, leaving the dinosaurs in charge of the park. Now, what happens if the dinosaurs escape from the park? Could the human species survive?In a way, this movie is akin to the stories ""Frankenstein"", ""The Invisible Man"" and ""Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" which also deal with issues relating to consequences of irresponsible scientific research.","

Its legacy is in the way you can close your eyes and hear the music, you can remember the first time you saw the dinosaurs on the big screen and had that moment of awe, the look of Goldblum shirtless on a table, of Grant scaring the bejesus out of a kid, of Satler going shoulder deep in diino-dung, that first reverberating puddle, the terror when you heard the hiss and clack of raptors.Jurassic Park has ingrained itself in film DNA and there is no going back.","

"kosmasp","11 July 2015","So OK the song (by Shania Twain) came out 4 years after Jurassic Park was released, but I was aiming at what I felt back in the nineties when I watched the movie. I know that people are still (as they were back then) impressed by the visuals, which might have faded a bit since then, but still are decent. But the movie itself or the story it ""tries"" to tell is seriously flawed.But there is enough special effects moments and moments of suspense to cover anything up. Didn't work for me though, because I wanted and needed something more than just ""Dinosaurs for the first time feel like they could exist"" (read be in a movie and feel real). Again good job with that, but lacks in many other things (that's my humble opinion). So if you can't be swayed off your feet by the idea itself and start questioning the characters and their ability to think in general, you still might be swayed by some of the actors. The Fly himself (Goldblum) is a great comic relief, but is it enough? Agree to disagree then?

"Tyson14","6 June 2015","Most film fans will have one film that ignited their love of cinema. For many that movie experience will come at a young age and in a dark theatre where the large screen envelops you in a whole new world you never thought possible. For me, like many of my generation, that film was Jurassic Park. Of course I liked many movies before that point but it opened my eyes to the potential of the medium like no other film, before or since. Scorsese talks about the religious-like experience cinema can create in its audience and watching Spielberg's classic for the first time I can fully appreciate what he means. It instilled a sense of reverential awe in me and whilst I had witnessed fantastical places like Oz and Tatooine I had never truly been transported to a foreign world as I had with Jurassic Park.It's a hard film for me to talk about rationally. It holds such a special place in my heart that I will never be able to find fault with the film, so instead I'm just going to gush about the movie's many positive attributes. Attributes like the groundbreaking special effects. The film is always assured of its place as one of the great technical achievements in cinema. CGI had been used in films for many years before but never quite to the point that you believed wholeheartedly in the events and creatures on screen. It is remarkable to think how far computer graphics have come since 1993 yet the film still looks utterly convincing, even more so than both of its inferior sequels. I can only put this down to the seamless blending of effects from the use of CGI, model work and animatronics. The film constantly tricks the audience into believing the dinosaurs were real by having creatures the cast could directly interact with. Because CGI has become so advanced now filmmakers rarely rely on the other types of effects work yet without them Jurassic Park's major moments would never have worked as well. Just imagine the T-Rex scene with the children trapped in the car, it is frighteningly believable because the creature is really there. Much of the critical attention is given to the computer wizardry but for me Stan Winston and his team are just as crucial to the film's success.Whilst the story is little more than a reworking of Westworld it is still so taut and full of genuinely magical moments that any familiarity in its conceit is immaterial. I can think of no other film with quite so many memorable sequences. The movie is packed with them, big or small, from the reverberating cup of water to the first dinosaur reveal, it is a film that has created more indelible memories than most filmmakers achieve in their entire careers. The cast are, with the possible exception of Laura Dern, perfect for their respective roles. When you compare it to a lot of modern blockbusters the film is surprisingly small in scale. Sure, you've got giant prehistoric creatures stomping around but the film doesn't have a sprawling cast of characters and it has no end-of-the-world climax. Yet it is the narrow focus that makes it all the more effective. Each character is given time to develop and whilst they may fulfil defined roles in the story they do at least feel like real and believable people. Jurassic Park may be a theme park but the film is more than just a thrill ride as you feel emotionally invested in the characters and events on screen.I've waffled on and not even mentioned the brilliant score by John Williams (a score so amazing it still sounds fantastic when slowed down by 1000%) or the film's perfect balance between comedy and scares. The film is a masterclass in blockbuster filmmaking and a bona fide classic.","

It has elements that have proven a success in his near twenty year career prior to this 1993 release.The film is a technological achievement showing dinosaurs brought back to life on an island theme park.The casting includes stalwart Richard Attenborough as the island theme park owner John Hammond, Sam Neill as paleontologist Dr. Grant, Laura Dern as his partner paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).
The film was made so long ago now (1993) that Samuel L. Jackson has a mere supporting role!Of course the story is science fiction based on genetic engineering and it is the character of Malcolm that observes that ""life finds a way"" in response to the genetic engineers assurances that the dinosaurs are all female and so cannot breed!At the time the dinosaurs are brought to the screen via a mixture of CGI and animatronic by renowned Stan Winston.The CGI does show a little of its age now?Mixing elements of disaster films, Jaws, King Kong to name but a few I was left thoroughly enthralled at the films grandeur that is lost a little on a television screen.The film has the usual Steven Spielberg company including music by John Williams but it is the dinosaurs that are the main attraction.","

The movie led to about a half dozen direct sequels but its effect is much broader than that, influencing almost countless films and filmmakers since.You can expect to find no shortage of tropes or weaknesses or major holes yet it still manages to gloss over them and hold it together with neat professionalism.

"zwrite2","28 July 2008","The very concept of dinosaurs coming back to life is so fascinating that ""Jurassic Park"" had the potential to be one of the best movies ever. At minimum, it should have earned a 10 rating.Unfortunately, director Steven Spielberg and the writers did not spend enough time teaching us  perhaps, via the film's children  about dinosaurs. Instead, there are too many dumbing-down scenes with dinosaurs relentlessly hunting people and humans doing all sorts of incredible gymnastics to stay alive.On the plus side, the movie has several ""wow"" moments involving gentle dinosaurs. The special effects are tremendous. When the characters first saw dinosaurs on the island near Costa Rica, I felt as awestruck as they did. Later, we see a dinosaur born in a lab, Laura Dern's character helping a sick dinosaur, a dinosaur eating plants a few feet away from Sam Neill's character and the two children, and dozens of gazelle-like dinosaurs sprinting away from a massive meat-eating predator. These scenes were spectacular.There are also a couple of interesting scenes focusing on the mean carnivorous dinosaurs. But, the meat eaters just don't stop chasing the humans. The action goes on and on and on. The longer these scenes go on, the more ""Jurassic"" evolves from a fascinating science fiction story into a trite action-adventure.I'm for action-adventure, and liked that the plot included a greedy computer expert played by Newman of ""Seinfeld"" conspiring to steal dinosaur DNA. Newman's comeuppance was enjoyable, and ""Jurassic"" was better because his behavior caused the dinosaurs to escape from their habitats and go after innocent people.But, there were many times that I wanted the pace to slow down and listen to the dinosaur experts played by Dern and Neill discuss the various species of dinosaurs. I also wanted to see more scenes with different species interacting with each other, more everyday scenes of dinosaurs doing whatever dinosaurs do, and even more scenes of the people interacting with the gentle dinosaurs.Spielberg, I think, missed a wonderful opportunity to educate the public in an entertaining way. An excellent movie would have balanced education and entertainment, but ""Jurassic"" took a mid-story turn toward entertainment, and I wasn't particularly entertained.The dinosaurs the movie focused on were more like people obsessed with winning. As far as I know, animals chase their prey, succeed or fail, and then look for other prey. They don't fail, but then spend hours looking for the prey that escaped from them instead of looking for other prey. If dinosaurs are that smart, I would have liked to hear the dinosaur experts discuss what else they could do.Spielberg deserves credit for inserting personal touches in the middle of his action-adventure and developing the Neill character from a child-hater into a child-lover although his quick transformation was a bit implausible. I also liked the comic relief of Jeff Goldblum's character, but the writers needed to explain better why a statistical theorist/philosopher was in the movie in the first place.I also think that the Richard Attenborough character was too much like the Dr. Frankenstein character. Here, was a brilliant entrepreneur who spent years pursuing his dream of re-creating life. Then, as soon as his experiment goes awry, he  like Frankenstein  wants to abandon his dream. The ending would have been better if viewers were left thinking about whether dinosaurs coming back to life was a good or bad thing instead of watching a black-and-white anti-dinosaur position.I cast an 8 for ""Jurassic Park"" when I initially voted on it, but the more I think and write about it, the more I conclude it deserves a 7 instead because it really missed an opportunity to be great.ZWrite","

"SPZMaxinema","2 September 2021","While not Steven Spielberg's best film by any means in my opinion, the practical and special effects accompanied by the music, cast, and thrills make this an exciting film for dinosaur lovers! Even though I'm not necessarily into them too much, I'd say it's a classic worth checking out!","

"Ben_BeanBag","7 June 2022","Almost 30 years later this movie looks stunning and has become one of the most iconic films ever. A lot of my love for the film came from being a dinosaur kid, but it's still a great film. The characters are all so much fun (except Dennis, his character sucks) and all have such unique traits that all come back in some way. The music is stunning (but you already knew that) and so is the concept of a dinosaur theme park. If only I could truly visit this place. 9.9/10 a Spielberg masterpiece.","

"neibrad","2 December 2017","This must be one of the top 10 Popcorn movies, of which Spielberg must occupy several slots. Everything about it is polished and meticulously planned. OK, we have seen the CGI done to death these days, but forgetting that cliché, just sit back and enjoy the ride. There are some genuinely terrifying moments. The ripples in the glass of water. The kitchen scene which 30 years later still has me holding my breathe. The end scene with the raptors, beautifully captured so that the T Rex fills the whole screen. One of the last, if THE last, true horror films to grace the silver screen, which has the same effect watching it on TV. Get that bucket of popcorn. Turn the lights down and be prepared for a roller coaster ride of a movie.","

"poolandrews","22 July 2006","Jurassic Park is set on an island just off the coast of Costa Rica which rich billionaire businessman John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) rents from the Government, within it's lush green jungles Hammond has created a new type of tourist attraction. The whole island has been converted into a giant theme park called Jurassic Park, a theme park where the paying public can take a tour & see real life Dinosaurs including Triceraptops, herds of Galamides, a Brontosaurs, Velociraptors & even a T-Rex that have been brought back from extinction by means of using Dinosaur DNA from blood found in fossilised Mosquitos. However, in an accident a worker has been killed & Hammond's investors get nervous about the safety issues that surround Jurassic Park so in an attempt to reassure them Hammond invites esteemed palaeontologist's Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) & Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) along with scientist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) & lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) to tour the park & hopefully endorse it. Unfortunately things don't go the way Hammond was expecting as a ferocious thunder storm hits the island at the same time treacherous employee Dennis Nerdy (Wayne Knight) shuts down the security fences so he can make his escape after stealing Dinosaur embryos that he plans to sell to a rival company. With the security fences off line the Dinosaurs are free to go wherever they please & the human inhabitants on the island find themselves hunted by the Dinosaurs...Directed by Steven Spielberg Jurassic Park was a monster-sized (sorry) smash hit at the box-office when it came out & held the record until Titanic (1997) came along, it still makes for great viewing even after all these years. The script by Michael Crichton & David Keopp was based on the novel by Crichton of the same name, in fact Jurassic Park the film went into production before the novel even came out. The film is great basically, there are lots of spectacular big budget set pieces that look good even now, there's some stunning special effects that still hold up really well & the Dinosaur human interaction is as good as anything else put on film with the likes of a huge T-Rex chasing a jeep through the jungle looking impressive. The story is reasonably plausible & it doesn't get too bogged down in scientific jargon, the various story threads all come together pretty well although I'd liked to have seen a few more people get eaten. Alive if possible. Most of the character's are likable & even the teenage kids weren't that annoying apart from a scene when Lex (Ariana Richards) can't seem to do something as simple as turn a flashlight off yet later on in the film she manages to operate one of the most sophisticated computers on the planet & use it to reboot the entire theme park electrical system! There is one exception though, I have to say that Laura Dern's scientist irritated me beyond belief, I don't know if it was Dern or the character but I really wish she'd got eaten. Slowly. My only real complaint with Jurassic Park is the pace, once it gets going around the 50 minute mark it's top entertainment all the way to the finish line but until that point I found it rather slow going with lots of very deliberate 'explanations' & exposition scenes that feel forced, it's the sort of dialogue that you know the filmmakers stick in there on purpose to get the audience up to speed like all the talk about how deadly the Velociraptors are & how they hunt. I'm all for build up & character development but I personally don't like long films, I just don't as I begin to loose interest & become bored so I'd have preferred Jurassic Park to have been at least 15 or 20 minutes shorter. This is a small complaint & Jurassic Park is still a thrilling action packed family horror film & I don't care what anyone says it's definitely a horror film & if it had been made by anyone other than family friendly Spielberg that's how everyone would describe it.Director Spielberg films the special effect & action scenes with panache & there are some cool sequences like the T-Rex eating a Goat whole (excellent!, as Tim (Joseph Mazzello) exclaims), attacking the jeeps & the Velocirators at the climax hunting the kids in the kitchen. Everything looks, sounds & feels great with brilliant special effects & CGI. The film has some nice scary moments & a few instances of mild gore & violence so it may not be suitable for very young children.With a supposed budget of about $63,000,000 Jurassic Park is technically excellent & set the standard for just about every special effects film thereafter. Some of the Costa Rican locations look gorgeous although I believe most of it was shot in California. The acting was alright but the real stars here are the Dinosaurs so it doesn't matter that much. This was Richard Attenboroughs first film in 15 years, Samuel L. Jackson has a small role & he would obviously go on to mega stardom, Sam Neill is OK, as already mentioned I thought Dern was awful while Goldblum is as likable as ever & steals every scene he's in.Jurassic Park is a great film, it's as simple & straight forward as that. It has brilliant special effects, cool set pieces, great Dinosaur action & makes for terrific Saturday afternoon type entertainment. What more do you want? I would imagine there aren't to many people on planet Earth who hasn't seen it yet but if your one of the few then what are you waiting for? Two great sequels followed, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) & Jurassic Park III (2001) while Jurassic Park IV (2008) is currently in pre-production according to the IMDb.","

"MartianOctocretr5","21 June 2006","Steven Spielberg's cinematic masterpiece, where ""two species, separated by 60 million years"" face off for a survival showdown. Dinosaurs return from primordial forests to reclaim their place as the dominant species on Earth, and the result is one great movie feast for the eyes.The premise is made plausible by an amusement park tour ride that explains the genetic process used in ""making a baby dinosaur"" (it makes you wonder if some day they will actually attempt this). Park controls over the dinosaurs go haywire, and nature's classic battle for survival is on.Several species of dinosaurs are, of course, the stars of the show. Unlike previous dinosaur movies, JP took the time to analyze their instinctual intents: survival, reproduction, hunting food, etc., rather than depict them as rampaging beasts that kill for no reason. The film even explored the intriguing possibility that certain dinos (raptors) had some measure of deductive reasoning powers.Almost every action and line of dialog has its place in relating the story and its moral. The movie knows when to go extreme with action, and when to pause and allow characters to evaluate the situation. The human actors, although somewhat regulated to supporting roles, are effective and have their importance too. The cautionary scientists, the greedy ""bloodsucking"" lawyer, the game hunter with a respect and awe for nature, the carnival showman, the techs who eat and smoke too much, even the imperiled kids (Spielberg's trademark) all represent aspects of science and the human condition. Characters are developed, some change, and some die; and in all cases, it fits the story's message.The production quality was superior: the use of computer technology was fresh then, and was used to emphasize the story rather than the habit nowadays to make the CGI itself the focus. The music score was inspired, capturing the majesty these immense creatures evoke. Clever humor bits are inserted at key points all throughout the movie, to balance with the gory scenes. The ""objects are closer than they appear"" sight gag is classic. A must-see for anyone. This is unique storytelling at its best.","

"Roger_Sterling","15 May 2006","What is it about Jurassic Park that makes me, and MANY others, love it? The special effects? The thrill? The fact that it's possible to watch this movie 800 times and it never gets old? I'd say all of the above, but also keep in mind: Humans NEVER saw dinosaurs, and along with fossils, this is about as close as we can get.This remains one of the most successful movies in WORLD-WIDE box office history, and it's not hard to see why. The acting is great, full of humor, the story is well-paced, and the Oscar-winning special effects and sound speak for themselves.1993 was clearly the year of Spielberg. He struck both box office and critical gold with Jurassic Park and Schindler's List. Both movies are amazing, and both won Oscars. However, the fact that only Schindler's List is on the IMDb top 250 boggles the mind. It deserves its spot on there, no doubt, but so does Jurassic Park.So this is, and will always be, on my top 10.","

"kennethtownsend-97230","13 October 2015","Jurassic Park (1993) Steven SpielbergMovie ""Jurassic Park"" is considered by many a classic. This move made us jump out of our seats because of the dinosaurs. It also made us awe at the stunning visual effects that were way ahead of the time. The plot is that John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people to his new island on Isla Neblar to see his new attraction with living dinosaurs. The problem is that these dinosaurs are unpredictable and eventually break out. Steven Spielberg has done a great job at directing this movie and has given us a good look into the past, but is this movie actually good. Take away the nostalgic affect and critically compare this movie and its effect to others at the time. This movie blew our mind. Now 1993 was a great year for movie culture. There were many movies that came out such as ""The Sandlot"", ""The Nightmare before Christmas"" and even ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". Obviously there was some competition in that year but ""Jurassic Park"" blew these movies out of the water delving stunning cgi/animatronics. Although there was a lot of things done right with this movie it is not perfect. First of all this movie is not scientifically accurate. The Velociraptors as shown in the movie have a distinct lack in feathers and are estimated to be only about half a meter tall (1.7 inches). This movie may be inaccurate in some parts but it still blew our minds. I was only about a few years old when I first saw the movie and the thought of dinosaurs chasing people around just blew my mind. This movie may not be what the past was exactly but it delivers a good representation of what would happen if we tried to tame these beasts.","

"rivertam26","5 March 2020","I still continue to be blown away by the sheer awesomeness of this movie. I remember being dropped off at the theater in the summer of 1993 with my little brother, not knowing what to expect. And basically nearly crapping my pants. I mean at 13 it scared the utter crap out of me. It was the first movie with digital surround sound and it was amazing. Steven Spielberg's popcorn masterpiece has a number of sequels at this point but nothing even comes close to the original. It's scary, funny, smart and action packed. It's nearly flawless in every way from the perfect performances pretty much all around except for some questionable moments from Dern. The movie's spectacular effects also hold up surprisingly well. It's still the best blending of practical and CGI to date. The characters are developed enough to care about and the movies pacing is perfect from the awe inspiring thrills of the first third to the primal terror in its final half. Truly one of the best and scariest movies ever made.5/5","

"LessThanPaddy","27 March 2017","Recently, a close friend of mine that I have known for almost fifteen years revealed to me that he had never seen this movie. Yes, the biggest sci-fi fan I have ever known had NOT seen Jurassic Park, perhaps the greatest sci-fi film of all time.I'm not much of a scientist, but I am aware that this production is riddled with scientific errors. And my response to that is quite simply, who cares? Like honestly, who cares? As a kid, this and 'Small Soldiers' were two films I watched over and over on repeat. Today, I don't know how well I could handle the latter, but I will never lose confidence in my love for Jurassic Park. In fact, I believe I have loved it more as the years have gone on and that there were things I appreciate about it now that I didn't pick up on as a kid (e.g. the moral debate about recreating dinosaurs etc).This film engages from start to finish, bringing in a great range of characters and creatures that all tie in to a well directed plot. Even now, the raptor-kitchen scene gets me as tense as it did the first time I watched it. I could watch the first T-Rex scene over and over too.My only regret is that I was born in 1992, meaning I was barely a year old when this film was released. Thus, I can never appreciate what it must have been like to go to Jurassic Park upon its original release which I'm sure must have been phenomenal for its day. In summary, I love this film and always will. Truthfully, I can't see a better dinosaur- related sci- fi film EVER emerging, ever.","

"Screen_Blitz","28 April 2017","Over the many years in his directorial career, Steven Spielberg has proved he is more than capable of collaborating with nearly every genre in the cinematic roster. This science-fiction adventure based on Michael Crichton's novel exhibits the absorbing talent of the influential filmmaker. In short words, this film is an eye-catcher in both its story and state-of-the-art special effects. Clashing together the prehistoric age with the present, this movie drops its character in the blistering heat of a battle against dinosaurs, who are polished with one of the most eye-popping computer-generated imagery ever put to screen; effects that still hold up to this day. But whether or not the film is faithful to Crichton's source material is not wired to my knowledge. It is terrifying adventure, but is one that manages to bring on the thrills and tension that make it a wild ride for the whole family. That is if the children can handle the immense scare factor of the giant dinosaurs causing mayhem. This movie stars Richard Attenborough as John Hammond, a biologist who opens up wild attraction on a remote island known as Jurassic Park where dinosaurs are brought to life by genetic engineering. Coming along for the ride is writer Grant (played by Sam Neill), his partner Ellie (played by Laura Dern), animal biologist Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by Jeff Goldblum), and Hammond's grandchildren Timmy (played by Joseph Mazello) and Lex (played by Ariana Richards). When the tour around the park goes awry and dinosaurs become hostile, the group along with several other tourists are pitted in a terrifying fight for survival.Steven Spielberg left a cinematic landmark on summer blockbusters with his film 'Jaws', a movie that left many terrified of going back into the water. Here marks another creature feature where the main villains of the story are prehistoric monsters who pick off humans one by one. And with hair-raising suspense and jaw-dropping visual imagery, Steven Spielberg showcases the characters' fierce vulnerability in a thoroughly effective manner. There are some truly scary moments sprinkled throughout the second half, some characters meet their ends in dinosaurs' bellies and children are in deep danger. For instance, the scene featuring the dinosaur's big eyes are peering through the windows of the truck where the young children are crammed, ready to make a meal out of them is a spine- chiller. But Spielberg effectively illustrates these moments in an effective fashion without veering into the horror territory. One of the absorbing aspects of these sequences is captured through astonishing computer-generated effects that bless the giant monsters including the velociraptors and tyrannosaurus rexes with a realistic feel. And visual effects wizard Stan Winston who did the effects for James Cameron's 'Aliens' is to thank for this. As for the performances, everyone does quite a solid job. Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are both equally charismatic as is Richard Attenborough in his role. Laura Dern and the young child actors make good use of their roles as well. If there is anything missing, it may be proper character development. But it just shortcoming that plenty of viewers can almost easily skim over. Jurassic Park is a fun-filled science-fiction adventure operated the hands of Steven Spielberg. It is scary, but it is also exciting to the point of leaving viewers alternating between cheering and leaning at the edge of their seats. Although there is no doubt that some children of the single-digit age crowd will find themselves scared, this still makes for a fine family-oriented entertainment.","

"Sirus_the_Virus","15 February 2010","Steven Spielberg is a director that tends to do films that have something groundbreaking. For instance, Jaws became the scariest film of all time. Not only cause the film is realistic and horrifying as it is, but because people still think about it when they go in the water today. Hell, I do. Jurassic Park was a groundbreaking film do to it's spectacular special effects. At the time, they were like nothing anyone had ever seen before. And it won the best visual effects award. It deserved it. Now days, Spielberg could remake Jurassic park and use the same special effects, but make them better. But Spielberg knows that what he did was art, and he wouldn't bother with it again.Jurassic Park is based on the Michael Crichton novel about a group of explorers who go to a new theme park for a preview and everything goes wrong when it breaks down and all of the cloned dinosaurs run free around the island.In both Jurassic Park films that Spielberg did, he has one scene in both that I find disturbing. In the first one, it's Wayne Knight's death scene. Every time I see it that part always creeps me out. Jurassic Park really works cause of it's spectacular special effects. Spielberg is a genius no matter what. It's a shame he doesn't do as much nowadays. He's done so many classics. I want to see more from him.Jurassic Park: A","

"dante440","26 March 2018","This is like the Mother of all movies as similar to Aliens. Nothing beats them really. Its nothing about the genre. I mean its just a great movie that would not get bored watching it over a 100 times. I personally did. I don't know how much CGI or green screen were involved. But the work they've put on this movie is just speechless. The animatronics they've used for the dinos were just beyond realistic. The set was simply superb. Personified so to say. You could almost feel like the dinos were really there and all these given it was just 1993. All the actors did a great job of moving along with the Dinos. The only black spot was Laura Dern. I don't know who did the casting for her, that person should have been fired. She was just terrible throughout the whole movie. cheap dialogues, useless jokes, over dramatic screaming. She annoyed the crap out of me. Almost spoiled the damn thing. Thank God for Jeff Goldblum and Sam Neill. They covered Laura's disaster. Seriously Lex and Tim did a way better job. We still remember the tour they did going around the world setting up them dino-tronics inside a park which was incredible. I was a kid back then and I found it amusing to the core and I still do. I got to see them actual thing in front of my eyes. Not to mention the video game promos, toys and other stuff. It was just a great feeling overall. I'm sure the whole team made some serious cash over the movie and the promos. All that and it was really sad to watch when they made fun of the movie with ""Jurassic World"" a few years ago. They should be sued really. Anyway, nothing to comment about Sir Spielberg and John Williams. You already know who they are. This is a great movie, deserves a 10/10. Don't matter if you're watching alone or with your family.","

Revival trilogy included, the Jurassic Park franchise, stand with its original film. Previous reviews already said what needs to be said. And I concur with all of it. It takes the best of everything, and don't look too dated. And more importantly, managed to make all the characters sympathetic. Even when they're not. The reasoning behind the script, isn't too far fetched either. And both the book and the movie have their own appeal. It can easily be listed amongst Spielberg's greatest movies. And deserved those successful box-office numbers. You can also check The Lost World, for having bits of the Jurassic Park novel, adapted to the screen. But personally, and in spite of some decent special effects. That were breathtaking there. I genuinely don't see the point in the other sequels...","

"TheUnknown837-1","27 September 2009","One of my favorite movies from the time I was growing up in the 90s was Steven Spielberg's 1993 box office hit ""Jurassic Park"", which to this present day, is still one of the most popular science-fiction movies of all time. When I was obsessed with the film as a child, I loved it mostly because of the dinosaurs. Looking back on the movie as an adult, I think I like it even more than I did before because now I see the realism that Spielberg was challenging his special effects wizards to create and I'm not talking strictly about how convincing the CGI and animatronic animals are.""Jurassic Park"" is based on a Michael Crichton techno-thriller of the same name, one of my favorite books. As in the book, scientists are invited to inspect and become the first visitors to a wealthy entrepreneur's island resort, where he is exhibiting exotic animals. Upon arriving at the island, the scientists and skeptics soon discover that the park is populated with genetically engineered dinosaurs separated from the visitors by electric fences. When the park loses power and the dinosaurs break free, the scientists soon find themselves running from the creatures they've been studying, but all the while awing the majesty of these fabulous animals.In my introduction, I said the primary reason why I admire ""Jurassic Park"" so much now is because of the way Spielberg portrayed the dinosaurs. And again, I'm not congratulating the team just because the dinosaurs look realistic. Realistic special effects are a package order in Hollywood. The team was challenged at the time, but they were destined to succeed. No, what I am talking about is the way the dinosaurs are represented. In previous dinosaurs movies, dinosaurs were either scary or awesome, but never both. They were either objects of terror or monoliths of majesty. Here, Spielberg decided to work the same magic he had done with the aliens in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) and make the dinosaurs behave not as characters in a monster picture, but as real animals. One of the opening shots displays the dinosaurs in full-view in broad daylight and the characters as well as the audience are overwhelmed by the sense of awe and majesty and wonder that would be so natural if dinosaurs really did walk the earth again. And even the carnivorous dinosaurs have their own sense of awe, finding ways to scare the audience as well as amaze them.And that, I think, is the real power of the first ""Jurassic Park"" film. In the two sequels, the dinosaurs were degenerated down into playing the standard monsters on the loose and the sense of majesty was more or less swept away. But the first film stands out not only as a breakthrough in special effects, but because it shows Spielberg utilizing the two techniques on the audience that made him a revolutionary and significant filmmaker: thrills and awe. And ""Jurassic Park"" has a terrific blend of both.","

"pcast99-1","12 February 2012","I wanna start off by saying I've seen this movie well over a hundred times now and the visuals still amaze me every time. I read Michael Crichton's book about five years ago and it has had the same effect on me as the movie has.People have often complained the movie has no character development and relies on the amazing visuals but I say that aside from the visuals there are some very intense moments of terror and awe that most science fiction movies today lack.And I agree that the character development from the book didn't translate to the film but I will point out that Michael Crichton himself took part in writing the screenplay and supervised it and he himself loved the film so you can't really say it's insulting to the novel.But I will encourage people to read the book before they watch the film or if you've already seen the movie, read the book because it is more in depth and very exciting to read.Both the movie and book are very highly recommended.","

"Hollywood_Yoda","7 February 2015","In light of the fourth installment being released in 2015, let's take a look back at the original 1993 film, Jurassic Park. I still cannot believe it has been more than 20 years! It was a great triumph of movie-making magic, when in 1993, Steven Spielberg brought dinosaurs back to life. Okay, so he didn't really bring them back, but he made us believe he did. It was an awesome film for the time it came out, very ahead of its time in fact. The technological aspects of the film like the animatronics were state of the art and computer animation in film was still young and controversial.Laura Dern and Sam Neill were a great addition to the film along with Jeff Goldblum and Richard Attenborough. A well rounded cast along with a superb director made the film a hit in the summer of '93. I only wish that the sequels could have lived up to the expectations of the first installment. Maybe Jurassic World can revive the series! See you at the movies.","

The other movie that comes this close to the above description when it comes to my thoughts is Godzilla.I rate it a point less only because I disliked the destruction of park - supporting script, else it deserves full marks for the scientific elements it has got.","

"emeeme2003","15 April 2021","Me and Jurassic Park have had a bit of an up-and-down relationship over the years; I can remember wanting to see it back in '93 when I was 5, only for my mom to forbid it until I was 10 because she thought it would ""scare"" me too much, only for my father to override her the next year when we watched its world broadcast debut on NBC (thanks dad!). And, even though it was playing on a relatively inadequate TV screen, I can still remember the incredible magic of that first viewing very vividly, as Spielberg (along with a lot of help from ILM, of course) brought dinosaurs back to awe-inspiring life, resulting in one of the most defining viewing experiences of my very young life.However, when I revisited it as a teen, the film failed to give me the same sort of jolt, as the overall tone now came across as overly campy, and a lot of that old magic had now worn off of the film, unfortunately. But, returning to Jurassic Park yet again as a 30-something, I find that my current verdict is inbetween those two extremes, but closer to how 5 year-old me felt than my teenage self, as the overall execution of the film strikes a great balance between Spielberg's abilities to both overwhelm us with awe, and utterly terrify us as well, and the film still holds up strongly as a seminal blockbuster of the early CGI era, despite certain undeniable flaws.First off, yes, the characterizations do tend to be a bit exaggerated at times, which both works for and against Park's favor; on one hand, roles such as Donald ""the blood-sucking lawyer"" Gennaro, or Wayne Knight's traitorous, candy-noshing computer programmer feel like they were manipulated to be the most obnoxious, stereotypical caricatures of their respective professions possible, and I feel like the only thing the film could've done to try to force me to hate them even more would be to tape handwritten, all-caps ""Hate me!!!"" signs to their backs. Yeah... they're that annoying.But, on the other hand, the trial-by-fire bonding Dr. Malcom undergoes with the children, as they attempt to survive the steadily mounting carnage, gives him a nice little character arc, no one can imagine Ian Malcolm being portrayed as anything other than the ball of neurotic, stammering quirk that Jeff Goldblum, just entering his ""unlikely leading man"" phase here, has built his entire career on, and John Hammond's foolish desire to give people something ""real"" to marvel at, and his crestfallen realization at how much he's overstepped natural boundaries by trying to play God, ultimately renders the well-intentioned billionaire a surprisingly tragic, sympathetic figure.And besides that, Park manages to entertain on a massive, Brontosaurus-sized level, partly due to ILM's ground-breaking CGI work, making the film (along with Terminator 2, of course) one of the game-changers that elevated that art from the occasional novelty it had been previously (see the X-ray scene in Total Recall), to a staple (and sometimes crutch) of modern movie effects, creating literally larger-than-life creatures that look, and more importantly, move with the kind of sinewy fluidity they should have, and saving the film from having to rely on the relatively janky stop-motion technique originally planned for the production.Not to imply that Park didn't have some superb traditional effects as well, as the CGI is smartly only utilized when necessary to portray the creatures in their more ""active"" moments, and are well-balanced with the use of Stan Winston's astonishingly life-like animatronics, retaining a irreplaceable sense of tangibility to the dinos, so when Dr. Grant the character is laying his head on the massive, wheezing stomach of a sick Triceratops, Sam Neil the actor is actually interacting with a physical object on location, and not just a digital effect to be filled in at a later point.Of course, all the effects in the world wouldn't mean a thing without a skillful hand directing at all, but Park has just such one with the magic of that patented Spielberg touch, the one that, in his prime, seemed to produce intelligent, crowd-pleasing entertainment at will, the kind that you didn't have to ""just turn your brain off"" to enjoy, and Park is no exception to that rule, as it finds a nice balance between Senor Spielbergo's two greatest strengths, one being the all-encompassing, awe-inspiring sense of spectacle its characters (and we by extension) are constantly feeling due to the sights of resurrected dinosaurs once again roaming the Earth (a one time, genie-in-the-bottle sensation that none of the sequels have ever been able to match... not that they've really tried), and the other, the similarly overwhelming horror at said dinos being set free to relentlessly hunt vulnerable, unarmed humans, and turn them into the next midnight snack.It's a sensation that's driven spectacularly by Spielberg's mastery of the high-impact setpiece, including, of course, the T-Rex's escape, a sequence that somehow manages to maintain a constant, ever-escalating sense of dread and terror for 10 minutes straight from start to finish, from the now-legendary introduction of the apex predator's presence with the ominous, earth-shaking vibration of the glass of water, to the skin of the teeth, ""objects in the mirror are closer than they appear"" escape by Jeep; whew, baby!With individual sequences like that, and with the overall film coming from the father of the modern blockbuster himself, it's no surprise that Park was as big as it was, not just in terms of money grossed, with the way it rampaged all over the box office like an angry T-Rex, and became Spielberg's 3rd movie to be the highest-grossing film of its time, but also in the way it redefined, for better or worse, the way the movie industry uses special effects to this day, creating a modern classic that, like its tagline says, is an adventure that's ""65 million years in the making"", but whose Chicxulub-sized impact will likely be felt on Hollywood for just as long after.","

I know lots of people are betting on higher budgets to bring this amazing one of a kind story back to life but it wont work. If you are looking for something unique as well as an adventure you have found it right here. I have been on this earth for only twenty three years and in those years I have not heard a negative comment on this movie. For the time it was made it is a masterpiece and when it comes to the writing and pacing of the story I would put it against a lot of different movies that are out now. Give it a watch and I promise you will not be let down. Jurassic Park (1993) gets a 10/10 for me and that is a hard rating to come by.","

"kevcoop7","12 February 2017","How do I even begin with this movie? This movie when I first saw it when I was a kid, skyrocketed my interest in dinosaurs, and I STILL have an interest in them. Now, here are my thoughts on this spectacular achievement.1) The animatronics-Wow! The animatronics were mind blowing for their time! I actually thought a T-Rex was chasing doctor Alan Grant throughout the park. The dinosaurs seemed so real! 2) The themes-The main theme of this movie is of how genetic engineering can spread uncontrollably if not monitored with care. The dinosaurs were loose when the park went out of power due to Denis Nedry in a sub-plot. The theme of power over something people can't have power over. These two themes are what really drive the story. 3) The characters-I only want to talk about three characters; Mr. Arnold is played by Samuel ""Jules Winfield"" Jackson. Dr Grant is played by Sam Neill, and John Hammond is played the late Richard Attenborough. All in All, this movie will forever be a classic movie I will watch over and over again. I highly recommend this movie.","

"vip_ebriega","24 May 2007","Review summary: An instant contemporary thrill classic. I have seen many Dinosaur movies in my life, mostly in my childhood. Okay, so I'm pretty much a suck-up for Dino films when I was younger, but none of these and more can diminish the charm of ""Jurassic Park"". Despite the many films of this kind that I've seen, I couldn't stand to look away from this film. Why? Simple, it's my favorite. Sure, it's not the very best film of all time, mainly because it's one of the films that ushered the age of the famous (or to most, infamous) CGI. The very term ""visual marvel"" is defined when I first saw a Brachiosaurus grazing while its puny human watchers are befuddled with wonder. What follows still remains one of the most thrilling, most exciting adventures ever put on screen, perhaps Spielberg's own best adventure since RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK. But I don't just like this movie for the certain charm, or for the boasting CGI dinosaur effects that surpassed anything of its era, but it was really well-one movie in more ways the one. It has a talented direction by Spielberg that made him one of the best filmmakers of Hollywood. It was also unique and very interesting. Another thing would be John Williams superb score and fine performances from the cast. Come to think of it, the CGI and other gimmicks are just peppered to make the film even better (I have seen some screen test featuring the dinosaurs being in stop-motion, not in CGI). This is just some of the reasons why this stands out different from other Dino flicks (""Godzilla"" (1998) anyone?).This is definitely not Spielberg's very best movie (for his dreams have come true with ""Schindler's List"" the following year, which swept the Oscars including ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director""). But this is no doubt, one of the films he will be best remembered for. It may just be one of my favorite films of all time. Forget the fact that this isn't a movie about human characters or deeper plotting. See it for the still-stunning dinosaur effects and heart-pounding thrill-a-minute situations and find your satisfaction to see a monster movie of A-list caliber. It's the best dinosaur flick ever (like there are any other films that fit the category). Rating: ***** out of 5.","

"Hellrazr360","1 June 2006","Jurassic Park is one of the films I just couldn't stop watching when I was younger. Although I used to watch it just for the roar of the T-Rex, the movie was still a perfect way for me to kill two hours on those boring Sundays I still deal with. While the idea of a movie that has the plot of ""resurrecting"" dinosaurs, the movie does an excellent job in making the plot believable and actually made me think: ""If we had the right preparations, could we create dinosaurs?"" It sounds crazy, but the movie really gets you thinking that after the easy-to-follow description of how they brought back the extinct lizards. As a movie directed by Steven Speilburg, the least one could've expected when watching a movie like this for the first time would be excellent CGI, and let me tell you, this looks better than many movies of today, and it's over twelve years older than them. Not only do the dinosaurs look astounding and believable, but the action they're put in (along with the actors) is equally satisfying and thanks to all-around great acting performances, there's plenty of well-done suspense throughout the film as well. But one of the many parts of this movie that immediately made me dig it was the music. The theme music in this film isn't only instantly recognizable, but it's also unforgettable and always a joy to listen to when watching a movie as fun and thrilling as this. While Speilburg has made (and still does make) some disappointing flicks he's still one of the top directors in my eyes and this one in particular stands out as a big hallmark. If you're looking for real entertainment that's larger than life, look no further than this thrill ride through the jungle.","

"slothropgr","10 July 2009","Sloppy story-telling from start to finish. It's pretty obvious Spielberg didn't give a damn about anything but the dinosaurs, especially not about tight, coherent plotting or believable characters. When I taught screenplay writing in Santa Fe NM I used ""JP"" as a perfect example of how even established directors who should know better can forget what's important. But Saint Steven's always cared more for effects than logic. And the dinos are impressive, even now. They almost distract one from the illogic of that first Grand Revelation with the brachiosaurs, as definitive a moment for fantasy as the star destroyer's overhead entrance in ""Star Wars."" But Sam Neill & Co approach these walking skyscrapers over a mile or so of gently rolling terrain, and they don't notice them until they're almost under hoof. Like I said, effect over logic. Too many of the characters are superfluous or just plain unbelievable. Jeff Goldblum doesn't add a thing to the plot, he just cracks wise and makes pretentious pronouncements (a faculty he perfected in the sequel). In the book his broken leg gave them a time limit to get off the island before the break went septic, but nothing like that here. Once his leg is broken he's basically forgotten. And Richard Attenborough's John Hammond is a kindly old Scots Santa Claus here, but sends his beloved grandkids out into a park that's chock full of dangerous predators--and even more dangerous computer bugs. In the book at least he was a nasty old SOB, though it was still a thin device. Bad plotting: Wayne Knight has lived on the island for months yet can't find his way to the dock because of a rain storm and a fallen sign?? And why bother with the ""life will out"" theme when it makes no difference? The creatures don't get off the island as they do in the book, so who cares if they can reproduce? If you want to leave room for a sequel, simply dump that and the ""lysine contingency"" and save some time. And finally we come to the biggest fraud of all: the ending, a classic dino ex machina. They're saved from raptors in the nickest of nicks by the T Rex! Who's announced his approach hitherto by making like Godzilla, but here apparently walks on tippy-toes. This was Steverino's inspiration, which shows he knew which side of the movie his box office was buttered on. To paraphrase Eric Clapton about a new rock group he'd just formed called Cream: ""Forget the plot! Forget the characters! Just dinos!"" My solution: after the Rex saves our hapless crew, he chases 'em all the way to the chopper, maybe even grabs a strut in his jaws as the whirlybird is lifting off, and Neill has to hang out and kick them free. Oh well, Spielberg proved with ""Crystal Skulls"" he doesn't know when to quit, so it may happen yet.","

"Spielbergian","7 July 2008","When I first saw this movie, it was like no other movie I had ever seen. It completely changed my perspective on movies, is one of my favorite films of all time, and most importantly was the gateway to other films (Mainly Spielberg)I think this is one of the greatest movies of all time for many reasons. The plot is spectacular, adding tons of suspense and action to the story. But what I most highly praise about this film is the visual aspects of it. Not just the special effects, but every single frame of it. I just love looking at the props (the tour cars, computers/programs running, the fences & signs, etc), the location, and main sets (The visitor lodge, the lab, the dinosaur paddocks). In my opinion, the most iconic scene in movie history, is when the cars enter the gate and you see the gate close as they enter the park ... It truly makes me say wow. The island setting is breathtaking, the art direction and sets are amazing, but overall, the most amazing aspect are the dinosaurs ... who look incredibly real! The CGI in JP opened up a whole new door for films, yet the effects in JP are even more appealing to the eye than 60% of the CGI in films today. And that's huge for a movie made in '93! And another thing, why I love this movie, is that unlike the other 2 JP movies, this one is set in an island theme park. Everything is new, the dinosaurs are in their paddocks like at the zoo. It's cool, like they're going to a theme park!But what I most enjoy about the movie, are the action sequences. I've seen hundreds of movies, yet my favorite scene of all time is the scene where the Tyrannosaur escapes and attack the cars. It's just so amazing. The rain just adds a certain tone that draws you in, adding tons of tension; And when I see the Rex exit the fence and roar ... I'm blown away! That scene truly is the most thrilling and intense action sequence in movie history. The next scene is when the tour car falls down the tree. Man, that scene is intense, and also one of the best. Another (Well, not quite a scene) scene that's really tense, is when Ian is sitting in the jeep and he sees the footprint's water shake. The music, along with the tremors is really exciting. Lastly, The Raptors in the kitchen is another great scene which can be really suspenseful.Next, the acting ... Which I like. Goldblum is absolutely brilliant as Malcolm, and his acting gives this movie a twist. Neill, the 2 kids, and Attenborough really give this movie a heartwarming feel. And I love Samuel L. Jackson's performance. Also the director is a real strong backbone to this film. Kudos to Spielberg.Another part I truly love about this movie ... aside from the action ... is the look. And what I mean by it, is the setting and the props. I'll explain it. OK, this movie is just so brilliantly shot, with beautiful settings, props, and stages. I'll give some examples. One good example is when you see the visitor lodge for the first time. One of the best looking scenes is when you see the tour cars coming our of the tunnel, and the mountains have mist overhanging them, and then you see the fence in the background ... Brilliantly shot! Another great scene, is when they're waiting in the cars, and Tim takes out the binoculars and looks out the back window. I love that scene! It's just so ""cool looking"". I mean, it pans out and you see the rain running down the window, and the green glow of the binoculars in the dark night. Wow!After you have seen this, you'll want to experience this over and over. I have seen this so many times, I even saw it last night, yet I want to watch it again right now.I know I've gone on and on, and I hope I didn't bore you. It's just I love this film so much.This is truly an amazing film. 10 out of 10 for everything I have listed.","

"emperor_bender","23 May 2008","This is the first movie I saw that I still remember. I specifically remember watching at my cousin's house when I was about 4, but I did not get one thing that happened.As the years went by, I saw Jurassic Park sporadically, but never got the storyline completely. Each time I watched, I would get a little more of it, but never the full thing. It was only recently I bought the movie for DVD finally and watched it, and fully got every detail.Jurassic Park is a great Sci-Fi thriller with great special effects and a great cast. Sam Neill stars as Dr. Alan Grant, the not-technologically savvy, old fashioned archaeologist who does not take long to show that he is the protagonist. Laura Dern plays Dr. Ellie Sattler, the archaeologist who has an obvious crush on Grant. Jeff Goldblum portrays Dr. Ian Malcolm, the smart, witty, sly, laid back ""Chaotician"". Richard Attenborough plays John Hammond, the imaginative, happy, determined owner of Jurassic Park. Bob Peck plays Robert Muldoon, the cautious, trained, quick-thinking hunter/raptor-cage operator. Martin Ferrero plays Donald Gennaro, the wimpy, hesitant, greedy lawyer who seeks to close down Jurassic Park if not to make a fortune off it. Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards play Tim and Lex Murphy, John Hammond's grandchildren who's thirst for adventure gets them into this whole mess. Samuel L. Jackson makes an early appearance as Ray Arnold, the commanding computer tech who is caught in the middle of Jurassic Park's security problems and problems caused by Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight), who seeks to steal embryos from Jurassic Park's lab to sell to a rival corporation.Aside from a great cast, they special effects were first rate. Especially for 1993. They were better than a lot of movies we see nowadays. And they were not overused or anything.The mix of an adventurous, eerie, inspiring sound mix along with scene lighting and weather make Jurassic Park an unforgettable film. Definitely worthy of the Top 250, although it does not seem to get that recognition.This is a movie you just HAVE to see at least once. Like Jaws.10/10.If you have not seen this movie...you must be a zombie considering no one can go without seeing this once in their life.","

"Stampsfightclub","8 January 2010","Two archaeologists are whisked away to a private island to get an exclusive glimpse of an amusement park that brings dinosaurs to life.Based on Michael Crichton's novel, Jurassic Park is a dramatic reconstruction of a scientific cloning experiment that brought the term Blockbuster to Hollywood and thanks to some masterstrokes from one of the world's best directors have created a timeless masterpiece.Steven Spielberg had already mastered the science fiction genre with Close encounters of the third kind and created a whole new concept in adventure with the Indiana Jones series and here, combining the two genres demonstrates an even higher expectancy as we see ancient creatures materialize to cause chaos in one of the best adventures ever made.The opening scenes set the tone for the upcoming problems as park rangers attempt to contain an unidentifiable animal in a cage which ultimately ends in a sharp cut away and we see Sam Neill and Laura Dern uncovering a velociraptor skeleton. Some beautiful comedy from The Piano actor sets the tone for his character and his wonderful rendition of a raptor's movements is eagerly anticipated and a good sign of what is to come.After Richard Attenborough invites himself into their home the adventure is underway. Spielberg in typical fashion creates a dynamic feeling of sudden excitement. The combination of the music, the helicopter and some wonderful picturesque panning elaborate the adventure which lies ahead for the audience and the characters.The first scene in which we first encounter the dinosaurs is cleverly shot, depicting the spellbound expressions with simplistic animal behaviour from the apparent extinct creatures.There are certain films which are remembered for certain big moments. The day after tomorrow is recalled for the sharp boat sequence, alien has the John Hurt moment where this 1993 release has a lot of little moments that ultimately make it bigger and bolder. The simplicity of seeing the dinosaurs for the first time, the build up to seeing the T-Rex and the manipulation of Dennis all add up to a truly spectacular film.In a world ruled now by CGI it's worth mentioning the highly impressive effects on show here. The animatronics used along with other methods capture the movement of the dinosaurs spectacularly. The T-Rex stands above all others, especially when seeing it in the rear view mirror of the car. And who can forget the water in the cup moment, perhaps the greatest build up to an action sequence ever? My personal favourite moment was the T-Rex introduction with the disappearance of the goat. The raptors are another stand out with their claw tapping predatory instincts.If you haven't seen this already this will make you sit on the edge of your seat and be drawn into a spellbinding array of action and adventure.","

"Keef-4","30 March 1999","It seems to me that there are two types of Speilberg movies: movies that use special effects to the max, thus bringing in the big money at the box office (Jurassic Park, Jaws) and movies that appeal more to critics and win Oscars (Schindler's List).We should take Jurassic Park for what it is, and that's a movie designed to entertain.  I do think some more thought could have been put into the script (although it has a great plot), but even with its flaws it puts other films in its genre to shame with reasonably good acting, direction, etc.  The special effects were amazing.","

"nathanhmcdonald","4 September 2011","Not many movies earn a 10/10 score for me. But Jurassic Park gets it...For me this movie nails everything. Based on the book written by Michael Crichton. Jurassic Park is about a man named John Hammond who does the impossible, he genetically engineers dinosaurs to serve as attractions in his upcoming amusement park Jurassic Park. But before Jurassic Park can open to the public it must be proved to be safe for visitors. John willingly invites the top minds of their respective fields of Paleontology, Mathematics Theory and Paleobotanist. But little known to John Hammond there is trouble brewing right under his very nose...And troubles name is Dennis Nedry the parks underpaid and disgruntled computer programmer who attempts to commit industrial espionage which sets off the chain of events that take place at Jurassic Park.Jurassic Park scores so high for me because it is a truly high quality movie, from the wonderful script to the wonder actors that portrayed their characters as any fan of the book would expect. And the music...This musical score on this movie is worth its weight in gold. This movie also features some very early use of CGI and its actually done quite well, Even watching it today the CGI stands up good to the test of time.Jurassic Park also features what I consider to be THE best animal attack scene ever filmed in the history of movies. ''Spoiler Ahead'' And that scene is when the Tyrannosaurus Rex breaks out of its containment paddock and attacks the visitors Safari Explores which are parked right next to the disable electric fence that once contained the T-Rex. There is no music in this scene, its filmed to portray the attack as if it were happening to you...And believe me it does well with that.Many people die in Jurassic Park...Yet it remains relatively gore less. Which might not be a bad thing...Over goreing a movie just looks like you're trying to cover up bad scrip writing and acting. When people get killed in Jurassic Park the camera does not show you exactly what is going on, but lets you see just enough for you mind to make up its own picture of whats unfolding. A nice touch considering many movies today don't let you're mind work for itself. The Book however is quite gruesome in its death descriptions.I honestly can't think of anything really wrong with this movie...If anything some of the dialog might come off a bit slow. The movie discusses some of the scientific aspects of how the dinosaurs were created and what have you...If you're not interested in this kind of thing, this might seem like a slow part in the movie for you. But overall this a movie I recommend to anyone and everyone. This is a must see for all movie buffs.","

"tbills2","11 January 2014","I remember first seeing Jurassic Park in the movie theater alongside my family as a young kid. I remember us having very close front row seats probably because we didn't get there early enough and the theater was packed. The movie begins rolling and I'm watching the movie and I'm enjoying it and I'm enjoying myself and it's a really good movie! But then when the scene with the T-Rex comes up, you know, that scene where the T-Rex escapes through the fencing of his no longer electric, electric cage........I got so scared during that scene! I was so frightened that I had to excuse myself out of my front row seat, walk all the way down the aisle, out of the theater into the lobby, acting like I was just leaving to go use the restroom. Yeah, right, I picked the moment smack dab square in the middle of the very best part of the whole movie to just go leave and use the restroom. Who was I fooling? I didn't have to go pee. I was terrified! I probably almost peed my pants! The T-Rex looked so real, and felt so real! It sounded real too! I know though that I at least made it through to the part where the massive T-Rex starts spinning the kids' vehicle with his huge snout, with the kids trapped inside it, but once the T-Rex started stomping their SUV, crushing the kids underneath, all while letting out a spine tingling and ferocious roar.....I was out of there, and in a hurry! I went and hung around in the restroom for a little bit, not really doing much. When I got back to my seat in the theater, it was at the time when the T-Rex is chasing Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum in their speeding away vehicle, where Goldblum is laying on the back of the jeep, all too injured to move but not too hurt to punch out a few wisecracks, and then the T-Rex explodes out of the trees and is right on their tail! I thought that I might have to go to the restroom again. I sat back down and was able to make it through the rest of the movie just fine, and my dad knew that I had been a little shaken up, so he rest assured me and let me know that it was all okay.I loved Jurassic Park back when I first saw it then and I still love it now today. It's one incredible feature. The whole point of just sharing with you my recollection of when I first saw Jurassic Park on the big screen was that...the dinosaurs looked so dang freagin' real! Way to go, Steven Spielberg! The CGI special effects of Jurassic Park's dinosaurs is truly impressive and groundbreaking stuff. I know Spielberg wasn't planning on using computer graphics on the dinosaurs, fearing that the computers wouldn't be advanced enough to replicate realistic looking reptiles that an audience could believe, but upon further digital exploration, some technicians tinkering around with some software, Spielberg and the technicians had a moment of discovery realizing that they could indeed use computer animations for the dinosaurs, and that the technology was good enough after all! Boy, does it show! That's called fate, my friends. The dinosaurs in Jurassic Park are awesome and incredible! They're a mammoth cinematic achievement on a behemoth scale!Jurassic Park is a great, beloved movie, thanks to Michael Crichton who wrote the novel, Steven Spielberg, and special thanks to the actors, Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Ariana Richards, Joseph Mazzello, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, Bob Peck and Martin Ferrero whom all give better than good performances, great performances. Steven Spielberg did an outstanding job directing. The theme by John Williams is beautiful and inspiring. I love that tune! The Jurassic Park is one of the great sets of any movie. I rate Jurassic Park a 9, I cannot give it an all out 10 because the movie is too mainstream and commercialized, and also, there's that one scene with Laura Dern and the raptors that takes place in the maintenance shed that wasn't quite on par with the rest of the film's scenes. That scene needed a little bit of tinkering. The scene with the stampeding herd of gallimimus is possibly Jurassic Park's best part. The T-Rex scene, too, is just as spectacular. My favorite moment is probably when the characters first see the giant brontosaurus, and the other dinosaurs, and John Williams score is blaring in the background. ""They do move in herds."" Wow, what an amazing movie Jurassic Park was, and still is! I love Jurassic Park!","

"elijahbutler-40119","25 December 2017","What can I say that hasn't been said already? Jurassic Park is a film like no other! When this came out back in 1993, it was a huge hit with a great story and groundbreaking special effects and they STILL work to this day! To be honest, I would actually consider Jurassic Park my favorite Steven Spielberg film since Jaws. This movie is THAT good. As a matter a fact, it's GREAT! I'm a huge fan of dinosaurs and I also love watching prehistoric films such as The Land Before Time, Dinosaur and other films, but NO other dinosaur film in the world topped Jurassic Park. This movie is an instant masterpiece and a HUGE classic on so many levels and became a franchise later on with 3 sequels and 4 next year. And although the sequels don't really live up to the original, I really did enjoy watching The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic World. I thought they were great sequels to a successful franchise and for a grade, I would give The Lost World and Jurassic World both a 9.5/10. However, I'm not really a huge fan of Jurassic Park III, but it's ok and i'd probably give it a 7.0/10. But to this day, Jurassic Park is the BEST in the entire franchise and it has stood the test of time successfully and absolutely without a doubt Jurassic Park gets a 10/10.","

"ryan_kuhn","13 February 2005","When one looks back at the evolution of movies, Jurassic Park has to be on the list. It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it was THE groundbreaking movie on the 1990s on the special effects front. This was the first mass-marketed, studio produced movie to use computer generated creatures, creatures who were seamlessly inserted into a live action movie. Special effects we take for granted now were pioneered by Steven Spielberg and his crew of special effect artists in Jurassic Park. The movie requires fantastic special effects, the story based on the Michael Crichton book by the same name about genetic engineers bringing dinosaurs back to life 65 million years after they died out. The story is pretty much the standard scary creature movie, as the dinosaurs chase people, eat people, scare people, but is still entertaining through the effort of Spielberg. The tension created through the various scenes in the movie and the real-life quality of the dinosaurs. Herky-jerky, fake dinosaurs would not be real-enough for the audiences, diminishing the tension that is created by dinosaurs chasing the characters in the movie. A fun science fiction story is turned into an almost life-like dinosaur chaser movie because of the revolutionary special effects seen in Jurassic Park.","

"Boba_Fett1138","24 September 2004","Historically this movie will always be remembered as the first big production using believable SFX and revolutionary CGI. For that alone this movie can already be regarded a classic. But the movie has more to offer. It's typical Spielberg entertainment, meaning that it is good!The story isn't really important, it actually is kind of weak. The movie is all about the dinosaurs and everything around it is of minor importance, at least for me it is. The movie also has a fairly small cast and the dinosaurs the biggest stars of the movie, especially the raptors and the wonderfully looking T-Rex.Let's be fair, the main cast isn't very impressive. Although Sam Neill still pulls of alright, Laura Dern isn't the world greatest actress and Bob Peck seems like a big B actor. The supporting cast is more impressive: Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight and B.D. Wong all form a wonderful supporting cast.I'm not a big fan of the visual style of the movie. For my taste it is just too bright and colorful at times and some of the sets look like they are made out of plastic, as a matter of fact, I think that they were really made out of plastic! And some of the sets are obviously filmed in a studio. Thank goodness that the dinosaurs don't look like plastic!The movie is tense and exciting but above all entertaining, completely with some typical Spielberg comedy and a John Williams soundtrack.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"jace_the_film_guy","13 January 2022","Jurassic Park is a classic film. What started as an interesting story has evolved into something much more. With a fantastic cast and plenty of iconic moments, Jurassic Park is a must-watch for all film lovers. While there are a few loose ends that remain unresolved, a few choppy editing moments and fewer moments with Jeff Goldbloom than I would like in the third act, it is still a fantastic movie.Additional opinion: Top 5 most recognizable/significant score of all time.","

"aesgaard41","15 August 2001","This movie made me feel like a kid again. I loved dinosaurs as a kid and knew everything about them, but as I grew up my interests strayed to mythology and ghosts. This movie returned me to my youth by reminding me of the sheer awesome splendor of these extinct beasts. Joseph Mazzello plays what could me me as a child while Jeff Goldblum could be me as an adult, wise-cracking and one-lining myself in the face of danger. Sam Neil and Laura Dern are a wonderful couple, but the real stars of course are the dinosaurs. The explanation of their cloning is told very convincingly, albeit not without some infallibles. Am I to believe that the DNAs from the fifty odd dinosaurs that appear in the whole trilogy all came from one drop of blood in one mosquito ? That was one very busy little bug to hit that many creatures in one day. Maybe it had a preminition that the dinosaurs were about to die and that someday they would be cloned. Pretty convenient to say the least.","

"Angry_Arguer","24 April 2003","Let's face it, no matter how hard he tries, Spielberg cannot help but become the sentimental showman that Kubrick wasn't.  That nuance aside, hold onto your lug nuts because thrill rides don't get much bigger or exciting than this!  To make my job easier, I'll just run the pros and cons.Cons: Lack of character development- In Jaws, Spielberg had to rely on technique over style.  Thus he was able to flesh out the characters and make a much more thrilling movie than otherwise planned.  Here we get characters with about 2 sentences worth of exposition and science babbling then another half-hour of screaming and yelling.The Gallimimus herd- I'm sorry but the visual effects in that scene just don't hold up as well as the others.  Also, they could have disposed of it and no one would've noticed any difference.""Over-reliance on technology"" motif- I'm talking about the script, not the production. Michael Crichton has never been an effective author and his preachiness in the novel translates into here pretty bad.  Fortunately they were able to get most of his boring moments from the book eliminated.  I still didn't like the annoying part about a 12-year-old being able to hack through a mulit-million dollar computer system to restart the power.Pros: John Williams- Someone give the guy an Oscar! Please!  His music here ranges from intense to breathtaking.  I especially love his main theme and the approach to the island segments, but his finale has to be right up there with 'Cadillac of the Skies' in emotion.The T-Rex attack- Well edited with decent dark humor incorporated and the oft-lauded lawyer chomping. No music though, just like the battles in Private Ryan.The End- Not that I was happy to finally be done watching it, but I just loved how Spielberg ended the movie with William's score and no dialogue. Here's the only time in the movie when he lets the actor's expressions speak for themselves and it works beautifully.Overall, a good movie, though lacking in the brains department,",NA
"isaacochoterena","1 June 2022","This movie manages to provoke concern for the characters.This is a simple story, but with a good development, and that is believable, even if the ending is very absurd and ridiculous. The premise is interesting, the characters don't have much development but you care about them, although the characters that are children can be a bit frustrating because of the decisions they make, the effects are very good, the performances are believable and everything that has to do with production design is well done.Apart from being entertaining, it involves feelings of fear and concern, which makes it more realistic, despite the fact that the ending is a bit ridiculous.",NA
"yaszi-83296","10 November 2021","This movie is pretty packed but still simple, it has a lot of fun dinosaur action and the story is brilliant. It was made in the 90s so the dinosaurs don't look the best, but the producers did a scary good job at making us, basically feel the impact of the large beasts when they hit the ground, the scenes were we can't see the dinosaurs are especially astonishing, you can see water puddles shaking, and you can feel the ground shaking in the movie, but the notices! The dinosaur noises are perfect but the T-Rex scream is just something else, it is truly loud and strong.Highly recommend watching, it's a classic and is great for watching with family, and don't worry most kids could handle it.",NA
"projectsgamer","10 July 2021","Jurassic Park is one of the best movies made I love dinosaurs and this movie Is great also every time Steven Spielberg has an idea it works so well so Jurassic Park is about Alan grant and Ellie are finding fossils stuff like that and John comes around and says that have a Jurassic Park so they go there and mayhem happens so Jurassic Park is a great movie when I first watched this I thought it was great but I was confused how this happened now I know Dennis makes all this happen and it goes so bad where everything is off and his plan fails which is funny the first half could be slow for some people for me it is great this whole movie is flawless so Jurassic Park is a great movie with great characters also this movie aged so well also u will think is now it will look better than this movie nope this movie looks better than the newer ones which is saying a lot so I give Jurassic Park an A+",NA
"jonathanmark-77048","11 May 2015","Plot: paleontologists Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) are among a select group chosen to tour an island theme park populated by dinosaurs created from prehistoric DNA. While the park's mastermind, billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), assures everyone including his grandchildren that the facility is safe, they find out otherwise when various ferocious predators break free and go on the hunt.I have loved this film ever since I was a kid. Each time I watch it, I'm always amazed at how they managed to pull this off without any problems during production. This is a fascinating story about how we shouldn't tamper with nature of any kind of species. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough all give terrific performances, fully realizing their character's motivations and not trying to make them blatant stereotypes like some movies would do. Even the kids , Joseph Mazzello and Arianna Richards are not annoying little brats that never shut up and whine, they are very likable and very charming. The special effects are top notch and are one of a kind. They changed the way special effects would be along with Terminator 2. Stan Winston and his team did an amazing job combing animatronics and CGI beautifully making the dinosaurs realistic.While there are minor differences from the Michael Crichton book, Spielberg stays true to the themes and ideas that Crichton had in his book, hell Crichton even co-wrote the screenplay to help keep the movie as fairly accurate to his book.Jurassic Park is my favorite Spielberg film, with great performances, fantastic special effects, a terrific story, and my all time favorite John Williams score from any film that he's done, Jurassic Park is and will always be in my opinion, Steven Spielberg's Masterpiece.",NA
"jmforsyth-33291","14 September 2021","So, full transparency, I watched this movie for the first time ever in 2021. It's one of those ""how did I go this long without watching this incredibly popular film"" moments for me (we all have them).I was impressed. The biggest shoutout to this film I have is the special effects hold up tremendously...it's almost shocking how well they still work almost 30 years after the film was released. John Williams' score is, as always, epic and adds a ton to the environment. Steven Spielberg utilizes his camera for escalating tension filled scenes to the max and the kids aren't terrible, which was encouraging because the obligatory kid characters can unfortunately really sink movies like this in my opinion so kudos to them.It's a fun movie: the experience must have been awesome in the theatre and I can see why it captivated kids enough as to spawn off some sequels and why it is now a classic. It's a textbook summer blockbuster and a great illustration on how to do popcorn movies correctly.8/10.",NA
"Filmjunkie-Idle","4 June 2011","This was a great and classic film which the world will remember. This is truly some of Spielberg's greatest work and I couldn't love it more. Jurassic Park is one of the three movies in the Jurassic Park trilogy. Jurassic Park is about John Hammond a dinosaur enthusiast who constructs a dinosaur theme park with living biological attractions. These are no animatronic animals but dinosaurs that are created to live and breath the air of man. As usual their is a dark side to every fantasy and the dream is threatened when the park systems break down, all hell breaks loose leaving the tourists and workers left for survival. Their are some great scenes with great uses of CGI and animatronic dinosaurs along with some extraordinary performances, cinematography all in this compelling adventure film.",NA
"Platypus82","12 September 2001","Okay, after writing reviews on The Lost World and JP3, and ranting and raving about just how awfully bad these movies are, especially compared to the prequel, finally I'll tell you just WHAT's so great about this movie. It's got everything. Yes, it has the, at the time spectacular and totally new dinosaur effects- but it also has great dialogue (bits of Malcolm's chaos theory strewn in without getting too scientific for a mainstream cinema audience- if you want the hardcore stuff, read Crichton's book-, Malcolm's sarcastic remarks), an INTERESTING STORY (it's the general idea of man trying control nature which goes wrong, but there are those subplots of Grant and children, Grant and technology, some rivalry between Malcolm and Grant, Hammond's not the greedy, nasty guy from the book [which is why he gets eaten in the book] but just an idealist trying to make his dream come true, and so on...), great music- it's just perfect. I've watched this film over and over and I love it every time. Someone reviewing TLW cleverly remarked that Jurassic Park has its fair share of plot holes too, only nobody seems to criticize them. Jurassic Park does have a fair share of ""flubs"" (there's a whole website dedicated to listing them), starting with the cliff that appears where the Rex paddock should have been, but also equipment seen in the background, crew seen in the background, robotic arms just disappearing, towels that suddenly change color, the emergency bunker directly next to the raptor paddock and so on and so on and so on. But these are not ""plot holes"", they're continuity issues, and sometimes smaller flaws of logic. ""The Lost World"", while I don't know how many of these smaller mistakes it has, already shows how acting, character development, dialogue and especially story move into the background and emphasis is on more dinosaur effects, more intense action scenes and mroe spectacular shots of people getting eaten, accompanied by a hearty ""CRUNCH"" of course. The first time I watched it, just after having seen JP3 I actually liked it, the second time I was more sceptical. There's a lot copied from JP (or Godzilla, or Hatari), and just about everything else is pretty stupid. (Hammond wants to show people dinosaurs for money, so for safety reasons he does this on a remote island with all sorts of security measures. Still, the project fails and the creatures break out and eat people. Now they have the brilliant idea of TAKING DINOSAURS ON THE AMERICAN MAINLAND to show them for money!!) And JP3 is merely a waste of time and money. It's got dinosaur effects and it's got action scenes but it's, if I may quote a newspaper critic, ""nothing but a slasher move, albeit with nonhuman villains"". Some STILL like this, say things like ""Gimme more dinos!"" or ""TLW didn't have enough blood and guts"" but this is what was so great about the first movie. It's got the effects PLUS characters you can identify with (in the sequels you don't give a damn who gets eaten. They could have eaten Goldblum's daughter for all I would have cared) PLUS an exciting storyline PLUS good dialogues PLUS the best soundtrack I've ever heard! But with a franchise like this they just can't help but squeeze money out of it until it's dead...",NA
"jakethesnake-42007","18 May 2021","When the film was released I was 7 and I relent loving this film. The film does hold up over 25 years. The special effects for its time was groundbreaking now some seem outdated. The only small flaw I have with the film is adults do stupid things like leave the children alone and other moments like that. Overall it's a classic action film of the 90's.",NA
"nicholls905-280-546911","5 January 2020","Spielberg created a true cultural phenomenon here. The film was ambitious and ensured special effects would leap forward. The film has dated, but nothing a modern revision wouldn't correct if the filmmakers wanted, I hope not though. Jurassic Park is a marvel of filmmaking genius and Spielberg ensures the audience is in for one hell of a ride. Great cast and a classic for modern storytelling. It's a shame there's not more skilled filmmakers like Spielberg.",NA
"joetufano719","1 October 2013","Jurassic Park was one of the most riveting theater experiences for movie goers back in 1993 at the time of its release. I myself was a toddler so I grew up watching it on VHS, DVD and so on. As a kid I pretty much watched it for the Dinosaurs. I mean come on who didn't like dinosaurs when they were kids? But now as I've gotten older, I've watched it a few more times and have a newfound appreciation for it, and largely thanks to YouTube movie reviewers Chris Stuckmann, Jeremy Jahns and ThatMovieNerd. Based on the original novel of the same name by Michael Chricton, rich billionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) hires a group of paleontologists Alan Grant (Sam Neill), Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) and Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to take part in a test run for his new dinosaur theme park. Hammond's corporation, InGen used dinosaur DNA they extracted from mosquitoes buried underground and blended it with frog DNA in order to clone the Dinosaurs and bring them to life. Usually before the film's release in '93, dinosaurs were used in adventure B- movies but what makes Jurassic Park so unique is that both the novel and film give scientific explanations for how they were able to create the Dinosaurs. Now these reasons wouldn't happen in real life but here it's presented in a way where it makes you go, ""That could happen!"" Hammond is pretty confident and excited to show his visitors what the island has to offer, but Satler, Grant and especially Ian Malcolm (who thanks to Jeff Goldblum's performance steals every scene he's in) is against it. Malcolm flat out says to Hammond that this experiment is going to fail, and he later says to himself on the tour ""God creates dinosaurs, God destroys dinosaurs, God creates man, man destroys God, and man creates dinosaurs"". Everything is going well on the tour until the power goes out during a storm, thus resulting in the Dinosaurs breaking loose and the tourists including Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim try to survive the outbreak. Having read some of the novel itself, the movie doesn't accurately follow the book but it certainly captures the essence of it. From a visual standpoint, this movie is just mind-blowing. More props were used for most of the close ups of the dinosaurs, particularly the scene where the T-Rex is ripping the SUV apart with Tim and Lex inside of the car scared out of their minds. You would assume that was a CGI shot but it was an actual animatronic. Not so much CGI is used here since Spielberg and the people he usually works on films with like to use practical effects, but while some of the CGI does look a bit dated in some shots, 95% of the rest of it is still ASTOUNDING! Character/Acting wise, David Koepp's screenplay gives us some pretty solid character development. All the actors in the film deliver 100% and each character (except for maybe Wayne Knight aka Newman) is likable, have interesting backgrounds and they all play an important part in the story. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) goes through his own arc where he starts out in the beginning of the film not really liking kids too much, but after bonding with Lex and Tim he learns the value of raising children. Ariana Richards (Lex) and Tim (Joseph Mazello) are surprisingly not annoying, they play an important part in the story and Spielberg is a master on working with children in his movies. As for the story structure, where some impatient people might criticize the story for dragging on the film takes it's time to tell its story, sucks you into its world and then about halfway through the film, it all hits the fan. Most films with action these days tend to throw everything at you right from the start, but Jurassic Park isn't one of them.Spielberg being probably my favorite film director ever, like I said is a master. He adds something to each shot and creates a sustained wonderment mostly with the first time we see the Brachiosaurus. Half of that is thanks to John Williams' brilliant score, which adds to the awe and wonder. Spielberg also knows how to create tension here in the movie. Two scenes in particular being: one scene where Ellie Satler finally gets the power back on and a Velociraptor's head pops out through the wall right behind her. As YouTube movie reviewer Chris Stuckmann described it in his review, ""One of the best jump-scares ever put into a film"". And the other scene where Lex and Tim are in the kitchen trying to evade the raptors, and we as the audience are able to see the fear in the kids' eyes. Overall, Spielberg and his crew successfully inject quite a bit of heart into the story, and create a nice mix of comedy, adventure and thriller elements that build up to in my opinion one of the best movies ever made, and one of Spielberg's best.",NA
