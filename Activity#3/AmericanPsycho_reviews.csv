"classicsoncall","26 August 2012","I've been letting my thoughts for this film percolate now for about twenty four hours, so before any more time goes by I'll try to get it all down here. I thought there was something up with the picture when Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) and his cronies were comparing business cards for the first time. I got the impression that it was all a sham, that none of them were actually Vice Presidents of Pierce and Pierce, and that they were actually role playing the position of executives in anticipation of an eventual promotion. Bateman himself never seemed to do any work, other than having his secretary line up his appointments to meet associates or clients so he could spend additional time not working some more.The bigger tip off that this was possibly all just an imaginary story was the 'Feed me a stray cat' scene. By this time it was pretty well established that Bateman was unhinged, but the question is, to what degree. Did he really engage in those prior killing sprees or did he just imagine it? Or a third possibility, was he envisioning what it would be like to go completely berserk if all bets were off and he could completely get away with it. By the time the story's over, I think you'd have to be open to all these various interpretations, because in the 'real' world, you wouldn't have a realtor showing an apartment where bodies hung in the closet just days before.Going in, I had some trepidation when the DVD opened to a menu screen suggesting a splatter flick, and if I'm not mistaken, an image of a chain saw somewhere along the way. I've seen a couple of slasher/gore films in my time, and though I'm not that squeamish (any more), that kind of stuff does nothing for me. So anticipating a chain saw scene, I could only groan at the impossibility of the physics involved in poor Jean (Chloe Sevigny) taking a direct bull's eye hit like that at the bottom of the staircase. Just one more suggestion that this wasn't really happening.And what of Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe)? What happened to him? Was this Bateman's guilt becoming manifest, either because of an actual murder or because of his own malicious thoughts? Generally I get really upset about movies like this because they tamper with one's ability to follow a coherent story and come to a reliable conclusion about what happened in it. But then again, it's got the word 'Psycho' in the title, so I guess all bets are off. Personally, twenty five dollars for a couple of drinks at a trendy New York City night club is about as psycho as I'll ever get.","

"MovieAddict2016","1 July 2005","In 1991, Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel ""American Psycho"" took the world by storm - women accused it of being misogynist, sexist filth and others were understandably shaken by its brutal and graphic depictions of unprovoked violence and torture.Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders ""twenty, maybe forty people."" It was originally slated for circulation in 1990, but Random House pulled out of distribution, fearing backlash. It was later released as part of a Vintage Series, and quickly sold over 250,000 copies, becoming one of the most popular (and, to some, important) literary works of our time.In the movie, Welsh actor Christian Bale portrays Bateman gleefully tongue-in-cheek, whether it's confessing to manslaughter over the phone (""I just had to kill a lot of people!"") or dancing to Huey Lewis and the News' ""Fore"" album before hitting an associate over the head with an axe.Patrick is a troubled guy. On the surface, he appears to be normal - he's a Wall Street broker with a secretary, an expensive apartment suite, his own limo and a fancy business card. But on the inside, he's a monster - complete with an insatiable blood lust and lack of empathy for fellow human beings. (If he can indeed be classified as one.) As a film and a novel, ""American Psycho"" is an attack on the absurdities of the '80s yuppie era - sometimes the satire isn't very subtle, in fact it's often made very clear, but I liked it. Because the movie is so eccentric and over-the-top, and Bale is so loony and maniacal, the satire needs to be equally strong - and it is. Whether it's business men drooling over each other's fetishistic business cards or Patrick discussing the nuances of modern pop music before killing more victims, ""American Psycho"" hits strong and hard - this is a great, overwhelming cinematic and visual experience. It cannot be condemned for being unsubtle - it never was.The performances are wonderful. Bale is superb as Bateman, totally embodying the character. As a man bewildered by his environment, and wanting only desperately to fit in, Bateman listens to Genesis and ""Hip to Be Square""; finally we have proof that too much Phil Collins and Huey Lewis will turn you into the next Ed Gein.Perhaps some fans of the novel will dislike Bale's performance (at times, it almost seems comical, such as when he murders his coworker Paul Allen, played by Jared Leto). But I thought it was the perfect mix of introspection, self-hatred, outer-loathing, lust, conformity and schizophrenia. Bale manages to capture all of this perfectly, and by the end of the film, I could not imagine anyone else in the role.Willem Dafoe, Chloe Sevigny and Reese Witherspoon all have co-starring roles, but at the end of the day it is Bale who really drives this film home - he's the reason it's worth seeing, and in part the reason it exceeds beyond the typical restraints of its genre.Since its release, many critics have accused ""American Psycho"" of being a watered-down version of the book, being both ""politically correct"" and ""lacking satire."" However, I don't recall the last time I saw a man beat a dog to death with the heel of his shoe in a mainstream motion picture. Or chase after a prostitute completely naked, wielding a bloodied chainsaw. Or hold a gun to a cat's head and threaten to feed it to an ATM machine.In fact, when ""American Psycho"" was previewed before the Motion Picture Association of America, they gave it an NC-17 rating - not for its violence, as one might expect, but rather for its threesome scene between Patrick and two prostitutes.Director Mary Harron cut footage from the film and finally managed to achieve an R-rating, but on a new ""Uncut Killer Collector's Edition"" DVD, you can see the film as it was intended to be seen - and it's a real fine treat. Now excuse me, I have to go return some videotapes.","

"Leofwine_draca","17 March 2015","A controversial adaptation of the controversial Brett Easton Ellis novel, this is actually a brilliantly conceived movie that sheds new life on the disturbed world of the serial killer – and as such may be the most innovative ""psycho"" movie since, well, PSYCHO! Filmly embedded in a hilariously '80s setting, this is both a thriller and a biting satire of the decade, with tons of subtle comedy and lashings of black humour to make the grisly subject matter a lot easier to digest.It's a wonderfully shot movie with plenty of memorable scenes, such as the infamous chainsaw murder, or the bit where Jared Leto gets an axe in the face. The movie works so well thanks to the strong acting which really makes it entertaining. Christian Bale is outstanding, a wonderful and scary and believable performance as a emotionless psychopath who realises that his own murderous inclinations are evil but is unable to do anything about it. His performance never falters for a moment.Similarly, the supporting cast of quirky characters are excellent – Reese Witherspoon's dumb-as-nails bitch; Samantha Mathis's junkie; Willem Dafoe's weirdo detective, plus a vivid array of minor roles. Although the movie is violent and pretty disgusting in places, it remains watchable and entertaining throughout thanks to the quirkily playful script and Bale's engaging performance. Definitely worth a look!","

"DanielStephens1988","15 July 2019","The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality.
People are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he's trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Feynman's real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despairIt's about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society. Bateman's interpretation of the world is skewed by his inflated ego and his evident psychosis as well as presumably multiple mental illnesses. Bateman is a killer, but still, he's not the killer he thinks he is, as he goes insane he can't distinguish reality from fantasy. His over the top chainsaw massacre style killings may be an aestheticized elaboration on partial truths, ultimately the film doesn't care. The more significant point of the movies absurdity is that within his society Batemans not the psycho at all he's just one more normal guy amidst a horde of uncaring detached from reality, secretly discontented American psychos. Bateman is surrounded by like-minded superficial people obsessed with all the wrong things like making impossible reservations at Dorsia and the tasteful thickness of their business cards. Within the homogenized upper-class elite identities blur as everyone strives after a generic yet highly specific image of success.Everyone we see in Bateman's company appears to be the same person. It's no wonder that identity is mistaken continuously and swapped throughout the film. The lawyer has mistaken Paul Allen or perhaps Batman has killed the wrong person becomes not only plausible but also an expression of the general confusion resulting from the loss of individual identity.Meanwhile, although Batman tries like the rest to fit in, the emptiness of his lifestyle also fuels a craving to stand out. To escape the conformity that he on some level despises Batman leads a second life as a killer, where he's unfettered from the bounds of society. Although he actually wants to be seen as a murderer as someone different from the rest of society Bateman is denied even the satisfaction by every self-absorbed yuppie he meets. When he's seen stuffing a body into the trunk of a car, the witness is only interested in the bag.This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue.","

"mark.waltz","5 January 2022","Your pretentiousness is over-the-top ridiculous and makes you look like a fool. Yes, your fictional, but I've seen so many of you around walking down the streets of Manhattan on my way to my office. I've even seen you in elevators that we shared, and I have to hide the laughter I'm tempted to burst out with. I may even have exchanged a glance with you in a club and rolled my eyes and turned away. In all seriousness, I've talked to people socially who have Patrick Bateman qualities (or lack of qualities as a better phrase), utilize the most pretentious of body cleaning products, but they are so much better than everybody else simply because of a label on a pair of jeans. Am I surprised that Patrick Bateman turns out to be a psychopath? Absolutely not.The performance of Christian Bale is calculatingly brilliant, and that is due to how wonderfully despicable he is from the start, and it only gets worse. The way he talks is absolutely annoying, and that makes the film hysterical from the start. His facial expressions through the eyes and the way he talks makes me instantly discus him, but there are a lot of fools around in the business world who thinks latching on to a person like that would be an aid to their career. Then there's the women in his life, a fiance (Reese Witherspoon), a mistress (Samantha Mathis), and the secretaries and other assorted acquaintances that he abuses mentally and some physically as the audience gets to see how deranged he really is.Jared Leto and Josh Lucas are among the men in his social circle, through business and personal, and as the murders begin to happen, William Dafoe joins the story as the detective on the case. It all starts when he brutally assaults and murders a homeless man, not just killing him but verbally abusing him in the minutes before he strikes. He thinks he is acting like God and a deliverer, and this scene is very hard to watch even though it is necessary to get the plot moving.I have avoided this film for years, but I did break down and go to see the short-lived Broadway musical a few years ago. Both the original movie and the musical are a slap at the ridiculous pretentiousness of the higher echelon society when it gets to be too much, focusing on pretentious meals at overpriced restaurants, getting laughs through the announcement of the daily specials. This is not going to be for all tastes, but I love how it ridicules personality types like Bateman, probably not all psychopaths, but so hateful in their uppity manner that you can't help but enjoy watching them being taken down a notch or ten.","

"nph19","12 October 2018","One of the weirdest movies I've seen. Saw on video tape when it came out then recently watched it again 18 years later. Forgot how fun it is to watch. The absurdity of Bale's character Patrick Bateman's shallowness and preoccupation with superficial things like how upset he gets over a colleague having a better business card than him makes this movie comedic while he's slicing up victims. Still not sure about whether or not all of the things happening were all in his head. I guess that's up for anyone's interpretation of the story. Very well done and one of Bale's best performances as if he's ever performed badly.","

"gavin6942","16 April 2007","Patrick Bateman is a heartless man with no concern for those around him. Serial killer... or capitalist? This film explains there might not be much difference and perhaps shows us why serial killers in the 1980s were more celebrated than any time before or since in popular culture.This is not a film for everyone. Some (like myself) will love every little aspect, while others might be turned off my the sex and violence... or just be really confused by the style (the directing is weird, but actually pretty straight-forward once you've read the book). I suppose that is to be expected. Even those looking for a horror film might be let down, as that isn't the real focus here.The cast of this film is amazing. Willem Defoe needs no introduction. Chloe Sevigny (one of my favorites), Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon (not my favorite but good for her role) and Gwen Turner. Even Samantha Mathis shows up. But, of course, stealing the show is Christian Bale.Bale was the perfect choice to play Bateman and I'm glad director Mary Harron would settle for no one else (turning down Ed Norton, who gets compared to Bale but remains inferior). Bale is able to be any character he wants (comapre this to ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"" and especially ""The Machinist"" and see if there's any of the same characters here). As Bateman, he is perfectly self-absorbed and also maniacally distant. The little dance during the Huey Lewis scene (one I have heard he added himself) remains for me one of the two key scenes (the other involving a chainsaw).Besides the great acting (the real reason to watch this), the music is very noteworthy. The book does a fine job of elaborating on the music of the 1980s, and I think they incorporated that well here (throwing it in to death scenes rather than as solo pieces adds an interesting twist). This film, along with the gentlemen I go to the tavern with, really got me into Huey Lewis and Phil Collins. Which is really wonderful. Not so much on the Robert Palmer or Whitney Houston...I guess I should also compliment them on the tasteful way (read: artistic) the sex and violence was done. Ax wounds, chainsaws and bite marks... threesomes and science-knows-what done with a coat hangar. But the vast majority is shot from such angles that it's almost all left to the imagination: you think you see more than you really do.Clearly, I really want you to see this film. It's possibly Bale's best, or at least the one that pushed him into the spotlight. He steals the show. You won't like it if you don't like horror, but the title is ""American Psycho"" and the cover has a man with a knife, so you know what you're getting yourself into. Grab some popcorn and a Cherry Coke Zero and kick your feet up. Enjoy!","

"atzimo","30 September 2002","'American Psycho' is NOT a slasher movie. It is a depiction, a fantasy if you will, of the life of modern man and his place in society.Nothing is enough. Money, sex, social stature, there is always someone else who has more and everyone else expect from you to try harder for even more.This movie is about eliminating competition the easy way. By killing your opponents. By eating your sexual partners. By destroying everyone around you.'American Psycho' retains the balance between this psychotic state, a chilling thriller and a very funny movie.The scenes that show Patrick playing music for his guests are absolutely hilarious, as he comments very seriously on records by artists such as Whitney Houston, Phil Collins and Huey Lewis & the News. The funny thing is that he chooses the most commercial or sold out records of these artists, to explain how much better they are compared to their previous, more artistic work. Another message of the state of the receivers of commercial art.You can analyze 'American Psycho' for hours. It can be perceived both as a deep and a fun movie. Even if you don't like the story, you will love Christian Bale's excellent performance.Enjoy.10/10","

"rahulsharma-95586","10 October 2020","The author of the novel and the director of the film both say that it wasn't in his head. All of the yuppies dress the same, act the same, have the same job position (vice president), and have the same haircuts, which is why everyone always confused Patrick with someone else. Additionally, the satire was to show that everyone at the time was extremely narcissistic and superficial. The landlord of the apartment cleaned up all of the bodies and gore that Bateman left behind in order to protect the property value. The point is that Bateman is an actual psychopath who lives in a society that's somehow even more crazy than he is.","

"grendel-37","13 October 2001","Having just finished American Psycho, I came to IMDB to get some clarification on the ending. And it seems I'm not the only one left vaguely adrift by the ambiguous ending.I've browsed some of your comments, not all 400+ to be sure. But some of them. A good sampling I think, and this movie has three distinct cheering sections.Those who consider it a masterpiece, those who consider it unredeemable, boring trash, and by far the largest segment, those who see it as a flawed masterpiece.I fall into the latter category. And no, I did not read the book. But as others have stated any movie that requires you to read the book, to ""get"" the movie, is ultimately a failure as a movie.So my review is based solely on the merits of the film. And contrary to what some have said, the film does have many merits. I found it brilliantly directed, and a superbly acted examination of excess, and boredom, and evil. An examination, satire, critique of a time, and type of thinking.
Even before seeing the ending, I thought how much bateman lives in people. Found myself thinking, an examination of bateman is an examination of men by the name of Reagan and Bush. How American Psycho is an examination of our times, and our modern theologies.I found the movie as a whole riveting, loved the restraint shown (and disagree with those calling for more gore, I think Mary should be applauded for her deft hand, the scenes have more power for what is not shown), and was captivated by nearly every scene, by scenes others have called boring, but I found profound.Bateman putting on his makeup, or simply trying to get a restaurant, and the near apocalyptic importance, such minutiae makes in the lives of empty men. The right card, or the right cloth, or the right table, or the right watch, how these are the signposts of an empty age and an empty soul, and how these things have more value than your fellow man... or woman.Bateman attains everything the materialistic times tells him he should want, but once he gets it he feels nothing. Emptier than before, less than before. It's only in the extremes of his addictions he begins to feel something, anything. He feeds to fill the emptiness, but the more he feeds the emptier he gets. He eats at his fellowman (woman) but in his bloodlust he eats at himself.He is the American dream, taken to its cannibalistic extremes.And never before has makeup, played such a mesmerizing part in a movie. Bateman's(Chris Bale's) face at times when he is under stress, takes on a plastic look, a glossy, sweaty sheen, and for all the world it looks like he's wearing a mask... and the mask, his mask of sanity, is beginning to run.Simply amazing use of makeup. And incredible performance by the lead actor. I wasn't familiar with him before this, but everyone will be after this.Upon first hearing about this movie, I had no desire to see it. I've grown up since the age of Hills Have Eyes and trash like The Beyond, watching people suffer no longer seems significant. I guess as we get older we ask more of our art than springer, or the WWF, or slasher flicks. We ask of our art to tell us something true. Something of ourselves, and our world.I think American Psycho under the deft hand of Mary Harron becomes more than my prejudices, and exceeds my expectations. Rises at times to dizzying heights not unlike art.Mary's restraint makes this movie. But I fear her restraint nearly sinks it as well. The ending is too ambiguous. Who is Bateman in the end. Is there a Bateman? And what did he do or did not do?In the end,the movie will nag at you. Did he or didn't he? And in the end, now that I write this I'm thinking maybe the answer doesn't really matter, maybe in the end the answer is the same. In the end a sin of thought, or a sin of action, is still a sin. In the end we are left with a man, and a nation... whose mask is slipping.
I think like the first Psycho, time will prove this one.... worthy. I now add Mary Harron to the small selection of modern directors I will tiptoe through broken glass to see. Directors like Dave Fincher(Seven, Fight Club), Carl Franklin(Devil in a Blue Dress), Johnny To(Expect the Unexpected), Ringo Lam(Full Alert, Victim), M. Night Shyamalan(Sixth Sense, Unbreakable), and Peter Weir(Fearless).Recommended.","

"Howlin Wolf","12 April 2002","... because with ""American Psycho"", Mary Harron and her screen writing partner have delivered the most faithful adaptation it would be possible to release without getting the film banned or revolting audiences so much that no one comes to see it. It would be IMPOSSIBLE to take some of the most extreme sequences from the book and commit them to film. What the movie instead does is to give us an insight into the stunningly fragile and insecure mind of Patrick Bateman, and to speculate whether his unstable nature would REALLY lead him to perpetrate vile acts, or whether he just fantasises about doing so.I think it matters little in the context of this film whether Bateman's exploits are actually based in reality, because whether they are or they aren't, Bateman is still left in the grip of paranoia, brought on by the shallowness of the society that is around him. Bateman is less of a 'psycho' than a vessel for all the selfish evils of society to corrupt, and a sensible audience is more likely to be left reeling at how he has been turned into a 'robot', than by the discreet amounts of gore that do feature in the movie.""American Psycho"" is fascinating to watch because Bateman is such a complex character. We feel revulsion at his violent tendencies, amused by his complete superficiality, and pity at his crumbling sanity. In order to evoke such diverse feelings from one performance, we need a superb actor. Bale's performance is right on the money. Never does HIS mask slip as does that of Patrick Bateman. He is completely believable in all his emotions.There is NOTHING in the film that is not true to the book (although there are bits in the book that are not true to the film) Both the reading and watching experiences are valuable and rewarding ones, but what they share with each other is that while they're exploring somebody else's mental state, they are also probing that of their audience. Can we see the funny side in the fact that these murders were committed for very trivial reasons?Can we ridicule someone with the knowledge that he is also a fantastically dangerous person? The film and book are constantly pushing boundaries, and if you don't fight that, but instead surrender to it, they will take you to many interesting places. Don't be afraid to give in to your emotions and laugh when you see something funny, because the movie shows us what emotional repression has done to someone like Patrick.Kudos to Mary Harron for tackling a seriously difficult project and turning it into one of the cleverest movies of recent years. ""American Psycho"" is anything you want it to be; glossy and superficial, or deep and meaningful. The question is: Do you look at things from the same narrow angle as Patrick Bateman does? If so, then the movie is not for you...","

"Movie-12","7 October 2001","AMERICAN PSYCHO / (2000) **** (out of four)Patrick Bateman: I think my mask of sanity is about to slip. ---""American Psycho""	The average filmmaker would turn ""American Psycho"" into an exploitative slasher flick, but Mary Harron and Guinevere Turner have adapted the controversial novel by Bret Easton Ellis into something unique and intriguing, a brilliant, thought-provoking social commentary thriller.Readers criticized the decade old novel because of its graphic violence, but that doesn't cause Turner and Harron to give into the controversial material. I have never read the book, but after watching ""American Psycho,"" I intend to. It's a scathing, rare film that probes our imagination and beliefs while experimenting with true psychological terror. It often makes startling switches between scenes of dark comedy and sequences that portray unsettling, graphic images. Director Mary Harron says in the film's press notes that she wanted all but one of the violent sequences to be disturbing. The amount of blood and violence here is certainly extreme, but considering the nature of the beast, not overly abundant. The film calculates every single act of violence, therefore, the victims are seldom random characters, but people we care about, which is why the scenes are so timely and effective.
The best description of the film's main character, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) comes from Christopher Lehmann-Houpt of The New York Times. ""Patrick Bateman lives in a morally flat world in which clothes have more value than skin, objects are worth more than bones, and the human soul is something to be sought with knives and hatchets and drills.""
Both leading actors in ""American Psycho"" have previously portrayed Jesus Christ, Willem Dafoe in ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" and Christian Bale in ""Mary, Mother of Jesus."" Talk about versatility. It's probably not a coincidence that Christian Bale was the initial actor of preference for Mary Harron. If an actor can display such a fascinating performance as Jesus Christ, he's more than capable of playing a psychotic serial killer because he already knows the other side of the moral spectrum.
Through the strong central character, ""American Psycho"" suggests several themes about the 1980's, including society's obsession with outer perfection, conformity, the rising threshold of material fetishism, and the strong desire of stimulation by drugs, sex, money, and power. Patrick Bateman isn't given a back story, however, and the movie doesn't offer his personal history. Bateman has no inside emotions. He reacts by inner impulse alone. He seeks gratification through the sex and drugs, but also by engaging in the homicidal behavior.    ""You could describe American Psycho' as a film about perfect surfaces and what might be lurking beneath,"" says Mary Harron. ""Inside, Bateman might want it all to stop, but for him it's a compulsion. He's like the serial killer in M, who says: You have a choice, but I can't help what I am.'""""American Psycho"" initially earned an NC-17 rating, not because of the violence but because of the graphic sexual content. The director's cut is available on videocassette and DVD, which shows the film's three-way sex scene in more disturbing, yet innovative, detail. That's a good thing, if you're not a sensitive viewer, because this film is all about details. The production design, the cinematography, the visual effects, the engaging soundtrack, the quirks each actor masterfully incorporates with their character, and every other aspect of the film is flush in detail.
This is a movie that requires more than one viewing, to experience the surreal visual arena, and to justify what we think actually happened. Perplexingly, the film's conclusion puts the events into question. Did Bateman really kill these people, or did he just really want to? The answers don't come easy, but this is a movie that begs us to look closer","

Dark comedy genius, with classic shiny ax scene perfectly in tune with ""Hip to be Square"" music, that Weird Al and Huey Lewis parodied in perfect meta homage.

"fciocca","18 September 2021","Due to the recent rise of popularity on the internet of ""American Psycho"", I decided to finally watch it, and I was pleasantly surprised. I was not expecting such a deep and realistic depiction of our modern society. For sure this movie was ahead of its time, and it took years before getting noticed.First of all I had to approach this film with the right mentality: I needed to go beyond what I was watching on screen and understand the message underneath all this apparent nonsensical and over the top violence. Bateman is the pure representation of a person that, despite being already successful and lucky, wants more. As he says he wants ""to fit in"" in a world where clearly does not belong. He started to feel envy and hate for colleagues that achieved more than him. This will quickly escalate in a burst of violence that will cause several victims. This is exactly the metaphor of what is happening nowadays with people chasing success, never satisfied by their goals. The killings are just an allegory: more and more people, estraniate themselves from reality, and they become mad, they are not able to separate what is real and concrete, from what is pure delusion. This is exactly what happens to Patrick Bateman, in his attempt to reach perfection. This kind of destructive mentality has so many bad effects on the character, that in the end he becomes crazy and starts to merge reality with ideas in his head. He feels bad about the whole situation, and I think that the detective represents the guilt of feeling this way towards other people.Christian Bale as always delivered an amazing and compelling interpretation. He managed to depict the fall into madness of Bateman. The guy was clearly dedicated to the role and he always has control over the scene. He managed to be creepy and funny at the same time. He gave life to a very interesting character that deserves to be studied deeply. Happy to see Willem Defoe, even if it was just for a few scenes. The cast is composed of good actors such as Matt Ross, Jared Leto and Bill Sage, who had a pretty decent acting career, with a handful of successful movies and TV shows in their curriculum.It is not an easy watch. There are in fact many graphic scenes, nothing too strong in my opinion, but some people may feel uncomfortable. Some dialogues would never happen if this movie was made today. There is misogyny, hate speech towards other people and animal violence. So, approach with discretion. I wish more commercial movies would push boundaries in this way nowadays and be shocking. Using violence in a smart way, and not just for the sake of being gruesome.","

"kosmasp","13 September 2010","While I haven't read the book and it clearly is playing in another era, than it was filmed, this still has quite something to say about our society. While I'm pretty sure this was also in the book, the really weak follow-up to this, showed us that even with a great source material, you don't have a guarantee that the movie will be great. In this case and with Christian Bale on great form (maybe only his part in the Mechanists overshadows this performance to date, end of 2010), with a very quirky and darkly funny script.While everyone is talking about the ending, this is exactly what the filmmaker wanted us to do. And I love it, because it adds another layer/level to the whole movie. Which is just great. And in case you haven't read the book either, this is not for the faint hearted. Be advised that this does deliberately offend and provoke. You may not like what you see. Actually it would be a big surprise if you really liked the characters at all. But that's the point. Which could also work as a downfall for the movie. But it is handled with great care by the director.Edit: rewateched this and have to admit, this still is as amazing as I remembered it. And while I understand that some may think I am rating too nice or too high, I think I should have given this the full points from the start. So influential, so good. Even if some things may have been a lucky accident - pun intended. Like the one sided face ""paint"" after a violent scene. Interesting that they had to cut some language and the scene that contained almost all of the nudity - but no problem when it came to the violence. To be fair, the book is apparently even ""worse"" or more descriptive when it comes to the things that may offend you.Whatever you may feel about the movie - you can't deny its structure, it cultural and social commentary and that pitch perfect performance by Christian Bale. And he gives you some eye candy too - if you are into that of course. Apparently something you can thank the director for - she gave him that advice based on the character in the book.","

"BA_Harrison","6 July 2010","Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a wealthy, good-looking Wall Street businessman with his own office, a pretty PA (Chloë Sevigny), an attractive fiancé (Reese Witherspoon), a desirable Manhattan apartment, and a fine collection of sharp implements and power tools, perfect for hacking up hookers and ridding himself of pesky professional competition.American Psycho, based on the controversial cult novel by Bret Easton Ellis, is a razor-sharp satire of the yuppie lifestyle that will forever be associated with the late '80s, an era when success was often measured by how much money you earned, who you knew, what suit you wore, and which restaurants you could get reservations at.Bale's narcissistic Bateman epitomises the yuppie stereotype—self-obsessed, materialistic, power hungry, and predatory, his life is dedicated to feeling superior to all those around him, no doubt because that, secretly, he knows that he is devoid of genuine worth: his position in the company is shared by several indentikit employees (so alike that there are frequent cases of mistaken identity); his fiancé is having an affair (but then so is he); and the only person who truly likes him (apart from himself) is his secretary, who he stupidly deems unworthy of his magnificence. Deep down, he's a very insecure and confused individual.To compensate for his shallow existence, Bateman extends his lack of empathy and ruthlessness much further than most: he not only humiliates and dominates all around him, both at work and at play, but he also kills!Both the book and film have been accused of being overly violent and misogynistic, and it is true that many scenes are extremely disturbing and very gory, with extreme brutality frequently dished out casually by an emotionally disconnected Bateman; but not only is American Psycho a very unsettling affair, it is also a very funny one (particularly for those with an extremely dark sense of humour), with hilarious satirical displays of oneupmanship between the high-rolling yuppies, amusing deadpan critiques of popular music as Bateman casually prepares for more bloody mayhem, and towards the end, several scenes of sheer unbridled lunacy (try keeping a straight face as Bateman attempts to feed a cat to an ATM).In the film's closing chaotic moments, events become very confusing, with a crazed Bateman finally revealing all to his lawyer over the phone; the very next day, however, we learn that the lawyer has not only taken Bateman's confession to be a sick joke, but also seems to believe him to be someone else entirely. At face value, this all seems terribly unlikely, but it does adhere nicely to the reoccurring theme of lack of individuality; it is also a deliberate ploy by director Mary Harron to allow her audience to come to their own conclusions about Bateman's predicament. Is he free to carry on killing or has all that we have witnessed only occurred in Bateman's unhinged mind? Hell, by the closing credits, we aren't even sure if Bateman is actually who he thinks he is.Usually, I don't like ambiguous endings that much, but in such a demented, twisted, schizophrenic movie, it seems like the only satisfactory way to finish.","

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6 February 2004","This movie is very strange. It's about a stock broker who's a serial killer at night. It's also about the social life of stock brokers, in the late 80's. The main character, Patrick Bateman, constantly excuses himself out of any situation that he doesn't completely control, and is, as all the other stock brokers in the movie, incredibly vain. He's cold and possesses no emotions at all. At the end of the movie, there is a weird twist, that turns everything that has happened up to that point around; apparently, none of it actually happened, and was all a part of Bateman's overactive psychotic imagination. On the other hand, maybe it isn't. There are a lot of different theories, but it all boils down to two possibilities; either everything happened, and no one cares, everyone is indifferent to the fact that the main character has killed an unbelievable amount of people, or none of it happened, but was just something that Bateman imagined, thought about, fantasized about. I can't decide which to believe, as there is evidence to support both theories. The movie is very weird; I've seen it four times, and I still don't really understand it. Whether it's because I'm too ignorant to understand it, or the fault lies on the director, for making it too strange, I don't know. 6/10.","

"rogerebertsclone","15 December 2002","Without a doubt the most underrated movie of the past decade, ""American Psycho"" is a piece of American cinema that shouldn't be missed by anyone, regardless if they do not like the violence (which does have its reasons).
Christian Bale gives a flawless performance as the troubled, deep down wannabe Yuppie who has psychotic, violent impulses. This is true acting here, folks. Not phoned in Tom Crooze acting. Some people object to Patrick Bateman narrating the movie [always a weak sign in a movie] and not letting us figure his motives out on our own, but if you watch closely, Bale shows us Bateman's vulnerablity through every minute of every day of his life. The movie is at times hysterical, as his character uses dominant Alpha Monkey behavior around the opposite sex. But again, it's all for good reason.
If not for Bale's performance, see it for the knife twisting satire of the '80's -- from the clothes, to the hairdos, to the music [I'll never be able to hear Phil Collins in the same way again!] The production value is rich in '80's nostalgia from the ""Black and White"" set designs to the enormous cellphones [how could we forget those?].This is a movie that major studios are too afraid to touch. This is film making. Remember film making? When films took you on a ride in someone's life and you would walk away with a piece of their mind? American Psycho doesn't have any real morals or answers, but it shows the deep psychological insecurities some men suffer everyday. Oh yeah, and it was directed by a woman, so all you feminists shut up!","

I couldn't understand why I was so , so, afraid of him even in films like ""Velvet Goldmine"" He is a poster boy for putrid souls in elegant wrapping. In ""American Psycho"" - a film that deserves much more attention than it's got - he is absolutely terrific. Totally believable. I could sense his delight in playing a monster of this kind. Interestingly enough this manicured monster seems to be asking for sympathy, imagine the nerve! But Christian Bale succeeds in showing us a face we (I) hadn't quite seen before and yet we (I) accept without question. He should have gotten an Oscar nomination but, fortunately, he didn't.","

Utterly contrived; neither shocking nor particularly comic.Bale is incredible though, that much is obvious, and his character carries the entire production. In fact, all the major actors are fairly spectacular, there's not a bad performance in the film.Such a shame then that the writers are more obsessed with making a Wall Street Clockwork Orange than they are producing something remotely original.Massively overrated. 3.5/10 based on performances alone.","

"mermatt","14 April 2000","This is a frightening and wildly satiric look into the mentality of the high-flying Reaganomics 1980s as the American Dream turned into the psychotic American Nightmare. The film will probably turn as many people off as are entertained by this weird journey that is a slightly more organized cousin of FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS.Christian Bale is amazingly energetic and even sympathetic as the deranged, soul-less creature who values nothing but surface appearances. We are given a hauting roller-coaster ride through a comedy of terrors that is the mind of this being who seems human but isn't quite sure himself. In fact, he doesn't even know who or what he is.Is he insane? Are we? That's the joker in the gamble. That's the riddle of the sphinx that we are left to solve -- if there is a solution.","

"movie-monster","5 December 2008","Its interesting that Christian Bale's most critically acclaimed role, in this very movie, is as a cold, psychotic and shallow yuppie. He excels by playing a character who openly admits that his only identifiable emotions are 'greed' and 'disgust'.Firstly, this film should not be misinterpreted as a horror movie. Those who have read the Brett Easton Ellis novel will already be aware of this. It is more a satire, or a harsh and uncompromising commentary on the material excess of Wall Street, or indeed America as a whole (hence the title), during the mid-to-late 80's. It works on both these levels and many more.The film starts as it means to continue. Bale's character, Patrick Bateman, introduces himself, and, as in the novel, goes into absurd detail regarding his washing habits and exercise regimes. For the next hour and a half, the audience is invited into his world. A world in which vanity itself, it seems, is everything. His life is composed almost entirely of expensive meals out with his high-flying friends & disillusioned girlfriend(played adequately by Reese Witherspoon), and various random, sadistic acts of violence and mutilation.Despite all Batemans' wealth, he is emotionally bankrupt. Love and relationships are as disposable as the world he lives in. For the entire film, Bale relishes the role and never lets it slip, talking as if he's in some warped commercial for a shallow and completely hedonistic eighties lifestyle. A lifestyle which leads nowhere. Bateman's character is also loaded with contradictions and hypocrisy. In one of the opening scenes, he wastes no time describing how he believes 'in taking care of himself', but days later will be snorting cocaine in a public toilet. Later, he describes how 'we need to provide food and shelter for the homeless', which is delivered as a speech to seemingly promote Bateman's morality in front of his peers. Shortly afterwards, he stabs a tramp to death in an alleyway. This speech acts as an omen or as a warning to crimes he will commit, or will imagine committing later in the film. His references to women in particular, soon become disturbingly ironic.Authenticity is added to the movie in the form of music and reference to the AIDS epidemic, which was just starting to take hold of the American consciousness. Bateman's highly unstable and vacuous state of mind is relayed through several brilliant quotes and scenes in the movie.One example is the scene in which he examines his colleagues business cards in depth, and becomes so obsessed and frustrated by the minor differences in colour and font that his hand visibly shakes. Upon seeing Paul Allen's card he whispers to himself in genuine horror; 'oh my god...it even has a watermark.' In Bateman's world, this could well be interpreted as the reasoning behind him murdering Allen later in the film.Much of the movie is left open to interpretation by the viewer, and it should definitely be watched several times. Its often hard to draw the line between reality and Bateman's own fantasies. Indeed many, if not all, of his murderous acts, could be simply figments of his own twisted imagination. The character Donald Kimble could indeed be an illusion. He interviews Bateman several times in the movie, at times appearing oblivious to the possibility of Bateman murdering Allen, and then later effectively accusing him of it.What the film really illustrates, much like the book, is a culture and an entire way-of-life, taken too a brutal, disturbed, and even demented extreme. It is a fusion of America's most beautiful dream, and its most hideous, blood-soaked nightmare. Money is no longer a barrier for Bateman. He can have all the women, sex, narcotics, technology and expensive meals he will ever desire. There is nothing left for him or his friends to aspire too. When every line has been crossed on a daily basis, he can only find satisfaction in the most depraved and barbaric of acts, and in the end, even this isn't enough.While the book is considerably more graphic and detailed, I would have to say I prefer the film. All the important and relevant aspects of Bateman's life and psyche are featured and Bale's performance elevates it to true 'cult classic' status. His portrayal of Bateman creates, in my opinion, one of the most vivid, cruel, iconic and unforgettable characters in the history of film.","

"gradyharp","19 May 2012","American PSYCHO, 12 years after its release as a film, retains its power as a very dark human comedy. Based on the popular Bret Easton Ellis novel and adapted for the screen by Guinevere Turner and director Mary Harron it has the effect on the surface of being a brutally disgusting horror story but if the viewer stops there the point of the tale is missed. This is a parody on human behavior pushed to extremes and one of the main reason if works so immensely well is the fine performance by Christian Bale as the title character.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an obsessive compulsive, style driven, ego maniacal successful wealthy Wall Street figure, working for this father's company. The film wisely dwells on the manner in which Patrick starts every day - doing abdominal crunches and weight lifting (the resulting boy Bale built is stunning eye candy!), every lotion and potion he puts on his face to keep his youthful appearance, dressing in the most expensive clothes and concentrating on reservations in the most expensive and exclusive restaurants for lunches and dinners with his associates (Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage). Critical of even the appearance of the outfits and shoes of his secretary (Chloë Sevigny) and polished like a gleaming Tiffany diamond, he is as shallow as those around him in the 'look at me' 1980s. He is dating a would-be fiancée (Reese Witherspoon) but pays little attention to her. Instead, at night Patrick murders people: he picks up hookers, kills them and mutilates them, hiding them in plastic bags like so much discarded clothing. He also murders street people for no reason and then begins a killing spree that reveals how completely psychotic he is, pretending to be a person he has already killed (Josh Lucas). The only law enforcement person on the scene (Willem Dafoe) but so little that he can be overlooked.American PSYCHO is a film that packs a wallop and Christian Bale gives a bravura performance. It is becoming a cult classic and that designator is well deserved. Grady Harp","

"JC_Ride","10 June 2020","Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me"". At first glance one might think that this is a horror film about ""the perfect psychopath"". It isn't. The movie deals excessively with themes of identity and standing out, and it also serves as a powerful critique to yuppie culture and late 1980s America in general. The cast is extremely talented but Christian Bale steals the show, with his memorable portayal of a completely insane individual.Patrick Bateman is a walking contradiction. The personification of greed and insanity hiding behind the mask of a good looking yuppie. He spends the entire intro describing his morning routine, but then later in the movie he's snorting coke in a public bathroom. He goes on about helping the poor, and later on stabs a tramp to death for no good reason.The slightest of things irritates him. He won't let people touch him and he shakes when he sees a business card that's perhaps slightly better than his. In fact thay simple card is his motivation to kill Paul Allen. He takes pleasure in killing and dismembering prostitutes, and as the film progresses he dives into insanity to the point were he can barely descern reality. His girlfriend and friends have zero meaning whatsoever to him. He doesn't work, all he cares about is music and getting reservations at fine restaurants, and murdering people of cource.Other that the incredible portrayal of Bateman, the movie also comes with very nice cinematography with extreme attention to detail, great acting and a killer soundtrack. The movie is chilling but also hilarious due to the sheer ridiculousness of Batemans character.But what i think sets this movie apart and makes it worth a 10/10 is the ending. The whole absurd sequence of Patrick feeding a stray cat to an ATM and randomly murdering people leads to him breaking down and confessing everything, finally seeking to be punished for his heinous crimes. But that won't come. Cause society doesnt care. The real estate agent that sells Paul Allens apartment takes care of the bodies Patrick has dismembered just to sell the apartment, and when he comes and she realises he's the killer, she just tells him to leave. Whenever Patrick confesses to his crimes noone believes him or they mishear his words. And even when he confesses everything to his lawyer, he doesnt even recognise him and thinks it's a prank cause he recently had dinner with the murdered Paul Allen. So was it all in Batemans head? Was it all real? Was parts of it real and parts of it figments of Patricks twisted imagination? Did he even kill Paul Allen? Or did the lawyer mistook Paul for another person, since it's a common thing in the movie for people not to be able to recognise one another. Regardless, Patricks ""catharsis"" won't come. He's trapped in this meaningless life of fancy suits, dinner reservations and senseless murder that goes unpunished. I don't think sharing my opinion of what trully went down is important, half the fun of the movie is figuring out the messages and interpreting the story as you wish.A masterfully crafted dive into insanity. A solid 10/10 from me!","

"Theo Robertson","26 January 2005","I'd heard a lot about the original novel though I'd never read it , possibly because it sounded like product placement with the anti hero giving long winded descriptions of what beauty products he uses and what designer suits he wears . This is translated into the start of the movie as Patrick Bateman washes , shaves , ex foliates and dresses in brand names . There's two problems with this , firstly that it holds up the main plot of a violent serial killer bumping people off and secondly it doesn't connect with people like me who didn't spend a massive fortune on expensive brand products in the 1980s Did you know this story was set in 1980s New York ? Oh yes you notice things like mobile phones the size of the brick , smoking in bars , and really crap music by Phil Collins and Huey Lewis And The News , but for much of the running time you totally forget what decade the story is set . Did anyone notice giant shoulder pads or hair like exotic plants ? , y'know fashion statements from the 80s some people don't like to talk about today . All these things seem to be missing as if director Mary Harron has only included 80s icons when the screenplay specifically referred to them . Watch WALL STREET just before you watch this and you'll instantly notice that one movie was obviously filmed during the 1980s while the other one obviously wasn't But the major problem with AP is that it tries far too hard to be clever . Despite the slow start once Patrick Bateman ( Played by Christian Bale doing a mean Jim Carrey impersonation ) starts bumping off people he doesn't like my attention was held except for a couple of details . When Bateman drags the body of Paul Allen through a busy concourse he leaves a trail of blood which nobody notices . That's detail number one while detail number two is when he chases the prostitute through his apartment block without again nobody noticing he kills her in an unlikely sequence by throwing the chainsaw over a flight of stairs . This got me thinking as to how no one notices his slaughter of innocents . I mean it's obvious the cops are onto him and yet no one notices the mounting death toll . Could it be that he's imagining it all ? By letting the cat out of the bag too soon with these two sequences from Mary Herron I was able to work out by the time he blows up a couple of NYPD patrol cars that Bateman's frustration in life is causing him to be deluded well before the final scenes . Did I say this movie was trying to be too clever ? Maybe I should say too confusing because it insinuates that Patrick Bateman is Paul Allen , or is a figment of Paul Allen's imagination . Duh. Whatever . Considering the very overrated FIGHT CLUB which came out round about the same time has a similar plot twist at the end AP's positives are dimmed even further by comparison Five out of ten","

"LeonLouisRicci","3 February 2013","The modern fictional serial killer Patrick Bateman might easily have said..."" They will look back with interest and say that I gave birth to the 21st century"". This, of course, is a bastardization of the well known quote from real-life psycho Jack the Ripper. It is pertinent here because it was a brilliant concept of Novelist Ellis that the real blood-letters and psychopaths were not the usually profiled, although Patrick Bateman does say ""I'm a child of divorce, give me a break"".But that is a doubtful creation of the empty, soulless materialism and ""cremation of care"" mindset that befits and thus spawned these greedy Wall Street monsters. Witness the recent financial meltdown. If that isn't a reality based on the metaphor of the Novel and the Film, then you just don't get it. But the American people got it in the form of taxpayer bailouts, unemployment and a sluggish economy.The Movie is an artsy, slick, sombre, but ""playful and mysterious dish"" of dark humor, insanity, and the instability of the insatiable yuppie in-crowd. For these American Dream killers there is so much detachment that even the names of people that work closely together are interchanged and forgotten. It is to this point that our modern manifestation of ""success"" loses his grasp on reality and fails to know who or what is going on.The last third is purposely ambiguous and for that it has a necessary unsettling and unresolved feel. A sense that...even our President can be delusional while appearing to be in command...""A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not."" (Ronald Reagan in a National TV address).The fact is that this is one great parable of a Movie that inaugurated the new Millennium with reflective and relevant prognosis.","

This film is not the easiest to perceive satire on our society.The image of the protagonist/antagonist of the film (Patrick Bateman) was taken by many as ideal. Naturally, not mentally, but externally. After all, Bale's character looks really exemplary for a man.The narration lasts slowly, but it is quite interesting.

"wlawson60","7 June 2008","A very funny horror flick. A worthy companion piece to its literary roots. A phenomenal, fearless performance by Christian Bale that, in a way, cleared up my questions about this versatile British actor. I could never quite warm up to him. Not even in ""Little Women"". Now, Bale as Patrick Bateman, revealed the reason. It is the cruelty around his mouth. His smiles are chilling and they work to perfection in this, his yuppie modern monster.His actions have the pristine shallowness of his business cards and the disgusting taste of his self awareness. You don't feel sorry for him, the way one did for Norman Bates. No, his character is unredeemable. His rough sex with two women while he rides one of them looking at himself in the mirror is one of the most disturbing film moments I've ever seen. I wonder if Bale will ever be able to play goodness, convincingly.","

"Coventry","7 December 2020","Up until a week ago, when someone asked my opinion on ""American Psycho"", I would tell them it was a boring and preposterous film. But that was mainly because I only saw it once, when it got released in 2000, and I was too young (or too dumb, or too eager to exclusively see violent carnage) to capture the true essence of Easton Ellis' novel/screenplay. Urgent time for a re-watch, I'd say! Twenty years later, ""American Psycho"" is still a bonkers film with over-the-top satire, excessive violence and an outrageous performance from Christian Bale. And yet, I still don't like it that much. Some sequences are brilliantly absurd, like when the egocentric yuppies practically orgasm over their own personalized business cards, but the majority of the film is just plain absurd; - period. Also, and be honest, who seriously cares about the frustrations of yuppie scum from the 80s? The film is at least ten years overdue. I read somewhere that Brett Easton Ellis envisioned a film version of his novel in the early nineties already, set immediately after the decade of the so-called ""young upwardly-mobile professionals"" of Wall Street. That would have made more sense, probably. Bale demonstrates that he's a fantastic actor, for sure. The film also features a long list of uber-talented supportive cast members (Dafoe, Witherspoon, Sevigny, Leto, Theroux, ...) but they are all quite redundant, since the plot exclusively revolves around Patrick Bateman. Brilliant soundtrack, too, but - again - overdue.","

"Lechuguilla","12 September 2011","Highly satirical in tone, ""American Psycho"" punches Wall Street in the gut, and does so better than any other film I have seen about that odious institution. The story, set in 1987, ostensibly focuses on a 27 year-old exec named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), who works in a Manhattan high-rise, for a company in the corporate ""mergers and acquisitions"" industry. He hobnobs with the chic and trendy. And his personality fits right in with that crowd: amoral, shallow, deceitful, condescending, selfish, sneering, and slick. But in his off-hours he commits blatant acts of violence. Patrick Bateman is a psychotic Gordon Gekko.Yet, the script implies no back-story for Bateman or motivation for his antisocial behavior. Thinly veiled behind the obvious plot line is the film's subversive message. This Wall Street jerk is not a person so much as an analytical construct, an idea, representative of financial violence that lies beneath the veneer of material power and success that Wall Street prides itself on. Because Bateman exhibits overt physical violence, there's no way that viewers can look up to him as a role model like they can theoretically look up to Oliver Stone's Gekko. As such, ""American Psycho"" surpasses ""Wall Street"" (1987) in thematic potency.The dialogue even says as much. In voice-over, Bateman tells us: ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me."" And Patrick's ""confession"" at the end is the confession of modern Wall Street.The film's non-script technical quality is quite good. Cinematography, editing, costumes, prod design, art design, sound effects, and acting are all high quality. The semi-classical music in the opening credits provides clever irony. But I didn't care for the 1980s songs, though they are representative of that era.The humorous, tongue-in-cheek tone prevents the film from being perceived as a too heavy-handed cinematic lecture. Instead, the film infers ""black comedy"", adroitly mixing the usually discordant genres of horror with social commentary.In the Patrick Bateman character, ""American Psycho"" accurately describes the Wall Street mentality of the 1980s. That mentality has become blatantly more intense since then. As such, the film continues to be relevant and probably will remain so for a long time to come.","

"mikhaigh","23 April 2000","Having read the novel by Easton-Ellis a year ago I was intrigued to find out how it could be made into a movie.Whilst turned off by the totally uneccesary details of Batemans crimes in the book, I felt that Easton's insight into superficial 80's yuppie culture made it a classic.Who could play a credible Bateman? Leonardo Di Caprio? I think not.How would Mary Harron deal with those controversial torture scenes?What we got was one of the finest movies I have seen for some time. Of course, those of closed minds will slate this film without even bothering to see it, simply because of the book's notoriety.I was impressed to see how closely Harron followed the book, replacing the un-filmable seens with suggestion, aka ear-cutting scene from resevior dogs, so that you believe you have seen more than you have. There are more parallels with Tarantino, such as the use of classic (& non classic ) 80's pop to create a stylised feel to the movie, that has not been seen since Pulp Fiction.Casting was superb, with Cristian Bale giving the performance of a lifetime, We, the audience, saw the souless monster within, Batemans superficial aquaintences, saw another faceless human being.Just like the book, you are never sure wether Batemans crimes are real, or just imaginary, but his slide into insanity is clearly real and paced expertly by Bale.Rheese Witherspoon as Evelyn was disappointing, ""Election"" showed what a great actress she is and although this role called for an airhead performance, it was clear that she was cruising.Mary Harron deserves the credit for creating an excellent film, that could have so easily been just another slasher movie.","

"bob the moo","8 June 2003","Patrick Bateman works on Wall Street for a major accounting firm.  He lives in a life that is material to the extreme and is more about where you can get reservations at than what you do with your life, where conversations never go deeper than music and the ultimate status symbol is the business card.  However Patrick Bateman is also a serial killer who mutilates colleagues, homeless people, call girls, anyone he can in order to try and feel something.  This film is his confession in his attempt to feel something.I must be totally honest and say that I hated the book.  I hated it to the point that, although I normally take old books to a charity shop, I simply put this one in the bin after I had read it as I didn't want to be responsible for anyone else reading it.  The concept of the book was good and it made it's sole point within the first few chapters.  After this point it simply made the same point over and over and over again in a very thick book that seemed to take pleasure from writing about increasingly violent murders.  At the end of the book I sensed that the author had long forgotten the point he had set out to make and was more concerned with shocking or sickening me.  So when the film came out I simply ignored it as I didn't want any more of my cash to go to this hack.However it came onto terrestrial tv recently and I thought I would give it a try, although I was ready to turn it off if I saw it going the same road. Surprisingly the film is good where the book was awful.  Both make the same point but one makes it in 90 minutes where the other makes it over hundreds of pages.  The film uses violence sparingly, mostly occurring off screen or in the imagination where the book lavished in it's increasing gore.  The effect of this is that the film is much more focused and controlled and works a lot better as a satire on the emptiness and shallow nature of our society.  It is set in the eighties but I feel it still applies today and Bateman could easily be any Western businessman whose concerns are so trivial on a global scale but so important to him/her.The film doesn't labour this point but is able to pick the strongest parts of the book to good effect.  Of course it still isn't perfect and it may seem a little hollow to some (but that is the point I guess) and some may miss the point.  The fact that a sequel has been made that is a straight slasher movie suggests to me that a large section of the audience missed the boat totally.  The main reason this film worked for me was a perfectly cast Bale.  He is a perfect Bateman and is almost otherworldly in his delivery, getting the dead eyed look of Bateman perfectly and contrasting it with his excited chatter on music and his sheer disregard for everything but himself. The support cast is surprisingly well known (Lucas, Witherspoon, Mathis and Dafoe) but it is Bale's film all the way and easily one of his best performances.Overall this film is not perfect and won't be to everyone's taste.  However just remember that I hated the book with a passion and I still liked the film.  The short running time makes for a more focused approach, the more controlled violence means it doesn't get distracted and a perfect performance from Bale keeps it all on track.  Much better than the horrid book from which it came.","

"rmax304823","14 May 2007","I didn't read the novel, only reviews of the novel, but I'm not sure that makes too much difference. A movie more or less stands on its own two feet. Or else it pretty much drops as dead as this one does.It has two very good features: (1) the performances, especially Christian Bale's as the homicidal loony, and (2) the art direction. You've never seen such opulence, spare and shiny and sterile.The problems lie with the script. It takes us through the days in the life of Patrick, who begins his mornings with some kind of horrifying bikini wax all over his face, then lounges around his office competing for nasty cracks with the rest of the boys, and ends up with mayhem of a particularly gory sort. I couldn't put the climactic reveal through any kind of step-down transducer that made sense. You mean ""it was all a dream""? I didn't find the blood sickening but found the characters and their values to be enough to gag a maggot -- excepting the winsome Chloe Sevigny and Willem DaFoe's affably ironic detective. The rest of them were about as appalling as the characters in ""Bonfire of the Vanities."" Who wants to sit through such a parade of narcissism for two hours? Don't we get enough of that from Washington? And this thing has been described as a comic/horror film. The phrase lends new meaning to the word ""comic"". What the hell is funny about it? Listening to Bateman's spiels about how deeply profound 1980s rock was? Is that funny? Or waltzing around in a plastic raincoat while preparing to chop a colleague into bits? Is THAT somehow amusing? Well. I'm kind of thinking it over and, yeah, I guess there is one comic element to the film. It's that it was taken seriously.There's a moral lesson here though. Please take this down. Yes, it will be on the exam. A slasher movie doesn't become a good feature film just because you've spent a lot of money on it and based it on a best-selling novel. Now pardon me while I go slit a vein.","

"AKS-6","4 June 2000","""American Psycho"" is a very clever adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's cult novel. There are very gruesome murders in the film, but you never get to see them which I am grateful for. The Patrick Bateman of this film (brilliantly portrayed by Christian Bale) is not the Bateman I imagined while reading the book, I don't know why, but the Bateman I saw before me was more cool and distanced. However, I like this Bateman better (as a character in a film/book, not as a personality) and Bale really brings something special to the part. Truly a great performance. Other than that, prepare to laugh a lot while watching the film. It's a satire and it's *very* funny. For example, Bateman's monologues about music before he kills and some very funny scenes involving business cards et cetera et cetera. However, it isn't a masterpiece and while it's a good film I still feel there's something missing. I don't know what, though, but I'll have to give ""American Psycho"" a 6 out of 10 = good.","

"Prismark10","25 April 2023","There were two novels written about the 1980s corporate greed culture. Bret Easton Ellis's gory American Psycho. Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities.Both novels were difficult to adapt. Feminist director Mary Harron aims to make the story a barbed satire of American corporate Yuppies. Part black comedy and horror.Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is the shallow successful commodities broker and vice president. His life revolves around personal grooming, working out, eating at exclusive restaurants, British pop music and kinky sex with hookers.Bateman also fantasises about killing people. Homeless peoples, prostitutes and even rivals. There is an amusing scene where his colleagues compare business cards. Bateman is visibly shaken when one of them has a better business card.Harron wants to highlight the selfish empty vanity of these people. Bateman is empty inside. The only thing that makes him feel alive is going on a killing spree.The film has an emphasised surreal edge. Maybe it is all in Bateman's mind.It has an intense performance by Bale. He also gets the black humour that Harron is aiming for. The movie however just peters out in the end and it loses its tension.American Psycho is also a film that seems to be admired by the same type of audience that liked Fight Club. Not realising that is satirising the boorish machismo men featured in it.","

"tedg","1 March 2001","Spoilers herein.I disliked this movie, not because it is intelligent but because it is a sophomoric bleaching of a powerful idea. That idea is that the FORM of the narrative should convey the MEANING of the story. In its simplest forms (Faulkner, Kafka) it deals with madness and what has come to be called the surreal. More subtle exercises in Joyce and Nabokov extend that to an emotional breadth and archetypal depth. But that results in hard work for the reader, so from time to time, lesser novelists recycle the idea at the high school level so that a larger and lazier readership can 'get' it.Films have a harder time with this problem, because they work with a more constrained imagination, and have a tighter integration with societal semiotics. Still, we have some intelligent work with the idea. Greenaway is my own favorite, who incidentally doesn't shy away from the edge of violence as is done here. (Why? To preserve the comic stance? If so, the filmmaker is unwittingly like the society she portrays.).One branch of the possibility of such ""wrapped"" films focuses on the actor, incidentally playing a character. That's the model attempted here. More mainstream recent film examples of how this is managed well are 'Sweet and Lowdown' and 'The Pledge.' The former creates a faux documentary narrator who imagines the subject. In this instance, the central actor pulls all the strings. A similar dynamic occurs with 'Pledge' where the wrapper is within the story (excluding the narrator). Easier to read.A related problem is that Harron mistakes style in the costumes and actor's bearing for cinematic style. Really thin. This film is as lowbrow as 'Being John Malkovich,' cleverness for dummies. 'Fight Club' was more artful and intelligent, though it wasted its opportunity. The only intriguing element here is the probably unintended notion of Dafoe as an imagined Moriarty. This isn't taken anywhere, but Dafoe does have a haunting presence independent of this simple effort.","

"Quinoa1984","15 April 2000","American Psycho is a terrific film.  I got a lot more than I expected from a horror film.  It turns out to be a satire about a narcasistic businessman who has a hobby for killing.  I wathced as Christian Bale gave his best performance yet, and I realized his vanity in the film was enough to be a psycho.  I guess the killings justify the means.  Still, the way I saw his life made me feel a little bit better because he is a maniac in a tie (what other killer would talk about Sting, Whitney Houston or Huey Louis and the News before ending their life-span).  Still, his antics are mesmerizing, entertaining, and sometimes even humorous (in a demented way).  One of the best of the year.  A++","

I had no idea what was going on, or who any of the characters were.Mostly the movie is boring and nothing happens, and when something does happen it seems to be thrown in willy-nilly to change the pace. It's disjointed and muddled and for the most part mind-numbingly dull.Frankly I'm shocked at how bad it is, considering the number of established performers. If ever there was a movie that shows the difference in mentality between actors and normal people, this is it.

"Bil-3","27 March 2001","Dull as anything could possibly be. Eighties materialism, psycho fascination and American sexual frustration of all kinds have been dealt with many times before this and in many, MANY better ways. Mary Harron's latest does, however, have Christian Bale's dead-on performance as Bret Easton Ellis' titular hero/villain and some nifty production design, not to mention a terrifyingly good performance by Samantha Mathis as a dope fiend who provides Bale with a regular friend-it's probably her best performance ever. The film caused much controversy involving activists and censors for its graphic violence and glorification of serial killers, but in the end it was all much ado about nothing: there isn't enough resembling humanity to be offensive, and it's all undone by an ending that renders the entire film completely invalid.","

"tpaladino","6 April 2006","First, I have to say that I really did enjoy the film very much. I also read the book AFTER seeing the film, which I think gives me a unique perspective as opposed to those who read the book, then saw the film as a disappointment.With that having been said, I was amazed with the excruciating detail that the novel's Patrick Bateman went into when describing his life and routine. Bret Easton Ellis is a truly remarkable author, and the novel is really a masterpiece of 1980's satire. I honestly can't say enough good things about it. Every page was amazing to me, and I felt that a portrait of a madman had really been painted for us in a way that nobody has done before.The film lacked a lot of this detail, but it was only noticeable after reading the book. I can see how someone who read the book first, then saw the film could have been disappointed, but seeing the film before the book really made me appreciate both much more than I may have otherwise. For someone who has no experience with either the film or the book, I would recommend the movie first, then followed up with the novel. The movie is very enjoyable and interesting on it's own, and the novel adds a tremendous dimension and back-story to the characters and their motivations.Also, one of the criticisms that I read in a previous review had to do with the locations not being believable due to the limited budget of the production. However, as a lifelong resident of Manhattan, the sets and locations ring very true. Pat Bateman's apartment in the movie is a really accurate representation of what a multi-million dollar Manhattan apartment actually looks like. Money does not go very far in this town, and it actually states in the book that Timothy Price made approximately $190,000/year, so it can be presumed that Bateman earned a similar amount. A hefty sum for the time, but not quite billionaire status. The restaurants and offices are also quite realistic and believable, especially since I have actually been to most of the places that are mentioned in the book.Finally, after the film and novel, I have to say that I actually found Pat Bateman someone who I could really relate to on some level, scary though that may sound. The obsession with material possessions; having everything in your life arranged perfectly; the drive to have the best (clothes, apartment, dinner reservations, women, etc), is something that still permeates the culture here in NYC to such a degree that I found many of his obsessions (compulsions?) and mannerisms extremely familiar. Disconcerting as it is, I can easily see where Brett Ellis' mind was when he fleshed out the Bateman character. From this point of view, it's almost easy to see how such behavior can mutate into insanity without even the blink of an eye. It's certainly made me look at my own life in a different light.","

"MadReviewer","11 May 2001","Much like its contemporary ""Fight Club"", the film ""American Psycho"" attempts to express dissatisfaction with the status quo of modern society through shocking (and typically violent) means. However, while this intent can be applauded -- sometimes, it's good to shake things up a little -- the execution cannot. ""American Psycho"", for the most part, features unlikable, unsympathetic characters doing unlikable, unsympathetic things to one another, ultimately creating a film that's very difficult to care about . .. or to take seriously. Based on the overrated novel by Bret Easton Ellis, ""American Psycho"" is the story of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a young, handsome Wall Street stock broker who's finding it more and more difficult to deal with how utterly hypocritical and fake his life has become. He hates the world so much, he doesn't feel like a real person, so the only way he knows how to feel real is by committing acts of sadistic depravity -- rape, torture, and murder. The ironic thing is, Bateman doesn't try to cover his tracks particularly well -- he almost wants to get caught -- but no one else believes he's capable of such heinous acts; after all, how could such a young, good-looking successful man be such a monster? The problem with ""American Psycho"" lies with the psycho himself -- Bateman. Christian Bale does an admirable job with the character, considering how badly the part is written, but the fact of the matter is that Bateman is never a particularly sympathetic protagonist. Yes, the people he tortures and kills are a bunch of unpleasant, two-faced hypocrites, but considering that Bateman is really no better than they are, there's no way of understanding, let alone condoning, his actions. He also has options besides becoming a serial killer, obvious (and more positive) options.  Think about it -- Bateman's been given more opportunities (money, friends, intelligence) than most people can ever even dream of in his life, and he chooses just to squander them as an Ed Gein-wannabe?  Come on.  Another problem is that Bateman is far too sane. He's nuts enough to think up some incredibly sick stuff to do to people, but he's rational enough to realize what he's doing is wrong. It may not have made him more sympathetic, but it might have made the character slightly more believable if he'd been crazier, thinking that his sick actions were just as rational as the mundane, boring things he did at work. (A subplot involving the idea that Bates isn't actually killing anybody -- all the murders are just in his head -- helps to make the film a little more believable, but not by much.) The result? One mean-spirited person kills a bunch of other mean-spirited people. Who cares?
Visually, the film's fine. Director Mary Harron moves the film along at a smooth pace, flipping with great style between false notes of security and genuinely disturbing. However, since the disturbing elements are diluted by the fact that it's difficult to care at all about the characters involved in ""American Psycho"", some tremendous efforts in regards to cinematography and editing get wasted. Ditto the performance of the actors -- as mentioned above, Christian Bale is very good as Bates, Willem Dafoe is good as the criminally under-used private investigator Donald Kimball . . . but no actor or actress on the face of the Earth could ever make any these characters remotely interesting, likable, or for that matter, watchable.
""American Psycho"" deserves some credit for trying to be daring, but it's ultimately an emotionally hollow film filled with some oddly gratuitous, clinically detached violence. Pass this one up. Grade: C-","

"CuriosityKilledShawn","7 May 2004","When I first saw this in the cinema in April 2000 I hated it. But I watched it with the wrong attitude. I was judging American Psycho as a horror film. Which it certainly is NOT. It's about (as the film constantly says) a complete [loser]. He's no friends. Unable to communicate on any level with anyone of his superficial, yuppie colleagues (some of which don't even know his name), takes far, far too much pride in his appearance and has way, way to much love for his material possessions. He is Patrick Bateman. And fitting in/looking normal/being just like everyone else is the toughest thing in his life. But murder, misogyny, degradation and mutilation is what he secretly longs for. It's really only Huey Lewis and the News that prevents him from doing so.American Psycho is full scenes that are tough to watch. You'll be watching them through the gaps between your fingers. How can you not squirm as Patrick Bateman looks in the mirror smiling, flexing his muscles, while having sex with a call girl? Or taking the whole business card thing WAY too seriously? Other times the film is just laugh out loud hilarious. Bateman tells Willem Dafoe's detective he would love to help him with his case but he has a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable. Come on! Cliff Huxtable??? Or how about the scene in the Men's Room when Patrick attempts to strangle the gay guy?Don't watch this as a horror film. It's a comic, drama-tragedy. Patrick Bateman is a disaster waiting to happen. And his inability to stay connected to the world around him is a wicked delight. Though his world of slick, cocaine-snorting, superficial, Wall Street yuppies of 80s credibility is not really the thing anyone would want to be connected to. Maybe he's better off as a psycho with no pals.The DVD has a great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture and a loud, well produced Dolby 5.1 soundtrack. The extras (apart from the deleted scenes), unfortunately, are pathetic.e movie with a scene of Bateman discussing his morning facial cream routine) that the point of the satire is nearly lost: Without the fickle trends of society, Bateman is an empty shell. Save his greed and bloodlust, he is a robot.Harron tones down the violence to a lesser degree - although it is no less gruesome; the scene where Bateman, nude and bloody, chases a hooker with a chainsaw is an edge-of-the-seater - and emphasizes the story's taking place in the ""Me Decade"" with appropriate song and fashion that add to one's enjoyment of the film.Despite a lame ""Is Patrick really nutso?"" twist that hurts the movie, the point is not lost here, and Harron has a solid sophomore hit on her hands.Bale shines as Bateman, making us thank God the powers that be did not go with Leonardo DiCaprio as they at one point hoped to. Whether he's stiff, menacing, dryly sarcastic, tortured or over the edge psychotic, Bale is mesmerizing. If there's any justice in the world, Patrick Bateman will be a career maker.Too bad the supporting actors don't fare as well. With the exception of Matt Ross, who steals his scenes as a homosexual co-worker of Bateman's in a memorable bathroom confrontation, all other actors are window dressing. Witherspoon's role is written so blandly anybody could have played it, while Sevigny is incredible annoying as her characer moons over Patrick. Willem Dafoe is amiable enough as a detective investigating one of Bateman's crimes, but ... this is Bale's movie.It's a wild ride that gets a little hazy in parts, but is certainly enjoyable in most places.","

"Tweekums","5 September 2008","When I first watched this I wasn't sure what to expect as I recalled the fuss when the book was first published, thankfully the film wasn't too gory. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that it was more than just another serial killer film, as well as that it was a very funny satire about '80s Yuppies.Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a self obsessed twenty seven year old who works on Wall Street. He and his colleagues are obsessed with having the best items and dining at the trendiest places. In an early scene Patrick and his colleagues compare business cards and he is mortified when one of the others has one which is more tasteful than his, even though they all look virtually identical. Strangely this seems to bother him far more than the fact that people routinely mistake him for other people. He uses this anonymity to invite out a fellow stock broker then murders him with an axe while calmly explaining how he thinks the band Genesis improved under Phil Collins influence. As the film progresses his psychosis deepens and he starts killing more and more people including a homeless man, a model and a prostitute he calls Christie.It is never one hundred percent certain that he is in fact killing people or if he is just delusional, I used to believe the latter but on later viewings think how he was getting away with his crimes was part of the satire, I liked that there are hints at both possibilities.Christian Bale's acting in this was superb, he seemed far more chilling than most movie serial killers in that while he is clearly insane he is also no different from those around him on the outside. I also thought Chloë Sevigny acted well as Patrick's secretary, possibly the only really normal person in the film.","

This is a very deeply serious portrayal of a competitive business man with aggressive violent actions. He is completely self absorbed. He does have insight: ""There is nothing there.""

realm. He is out of control. And laughs with his friends because living with his torturous obsessions is his punishment.","

"ThereelscoopwithKK","13 December 2022","I can't think of one redeeming quality of this movie. I have no idea where people see comedy in it. There's nothing fun about it either as at least half of the movie is just a bunch of businessmen booking reservations trying to flex which restaurant they are going to. For this movie to succeed for me Bale's character needed to be at the level of a Hannibal Lecter level villain and he's just nowhere near that.I understand the movie is trying to send some message about big business corporate culture but it just pushes this too far making it not at all believable. A little subtly would have gone a long way.I've read about how it also is trying to send a message about human nature. This claim to me is just people trying to appear intellectually superior by finding meaning in a movie because it's consider a classic when there is none to be found. The only thing it actually proved about humanity is that there are highly successful, affluent people that can be as deranged as anyone else.Even if you were interested in Bateman's twisted mind the ending makes it unclear what even actually took place and what was fabricated in his mind . It really just made me feel silly for watching it through to the end.The only character I found compelling was Dafoe's character and ultimately he was quite inconsequential as well.","

"youngcollind","14 October 2022","I'm usually inclined to scrutinize a song for how memorable it is, but generally don't hold film to the same standard. If a movie entertains me in the moment, then it's done it's job, even if I never think about it again. Which makes it kind of remarkable to realize that American Psycho still takes up a great deal of real estate in my mind, twenty years after I first saw it. I mean it doesn't hurt that the film has wormed it's way so deep into pop culture that the memes and references are virtually inescapable. Revisiting it just feels like singing along to a greatest hits compilation, ""Here comes the business card scene! Watch out Paul Allen!""It succeeds by offering surface level entertainment with more under the hood. The exaggeration of both the violent and the mundane lighten the mood of the morose subject matter, making for some unexpected hilarity. Like the little dance that Christian Bale does right before lacing into Jared Leto, it's a pitch perfect comedic performance that makes the ensuing mayhem an infectiously good time.It's clear throughout that there's more to this than the surface level story, yet instead of beating you over the head with it's message, it smartly remains vague, staying open for the viewer to interpret it's themes. Obviously an indictment on 80s wall street yuppies, it's unclear how broad the umbrella is meant to stretch. Is Patrick Bateman a personification of all soulless capitalist greed? Are we all him as we modify a public persona to chase unattainable standards? Depending on how much you zoom in on the lens, you can see different things at different times, giving the film an appeal that's both personal and universal.","

"ElMaruecan82","9 March 2020","I was 27 with high enough a salary to be a chain-dater, taking girls to the same expensive restaurants, especially one with the best panoramic view on Casablanca. My face became familiar to the waiters and they did a good job pretending it was my first ""visit"". I could bring girls regardless of any intentions to build a relationship; what mattered was the status. Two evenings could cost me a tenth of my salary but it was worth it. And that's the degree of vanity to which I could relate to Patrick Bateman, 26, embodying that point of a man's life where the more he eats, the hungrier he gets.""American Psycho"" is set in the 80s but things haven't changed much; in the 2010s, we could all have a nice girlfriend and yet keep on lusting on that sexy profile on Facebook. Maybe the late twenties is an age where the manly ego roars too loudly to listen to reason, maybe there are so many possibilities that we're more likely to make decisions lingering on fantasies rather than reality, moreover in a time where sex is trivialized by porn and violence by pop-culture, which ""American Psycho"" shows (as opposite of ""tells"").The film, adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel and directed by Mary Harron, is about that state of vanity driven to its more extreme and disturbing form. Here is Bateman's existential dilemma: should he surrender to the comfort of conformism at the risk of becoming a mediocrity (in his own terms) or acting free in the name of a supra-individuality that puts him above everyone else? The film is set during the Reagan-era and centers on arrogant yuppies who measure success by their capability to get the best tables, the most exotic meals and fulfill any kind of sexual fantasy. And Patrick Bateman is the most troubled of them: he's attractive, articulate but his moments of social adequacy are punctuated with anxiety driven by jealous rage.But the weirdest aspect is less in his behavior than the way it keeps getting unnoticed. It's very telling that the final line of the film is ""That confession meant nothing"". Many movies tend to use violence to make a specific comment against society, channeling ""Taxi Driver"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"" (there's even a scene that echoes Kubrick's film where Bateman confronts a homeless man) but in ""American Psycho"", violence says more about the perpetrator and the environment that can't perceive him as the degenerate man he is. It's not about the vanity of men who reached the top but the way they are seen as perfectly compatible with civilization although they're acting below animals, it's like a more cynical version of ""Being There"" with Peter Sellers.""American Psycho"" can also be regarded as an alternative to ""Fight Club"". In Fincher's film, men compensated the vacuity of their lives by uniting and draining their energy from their survival instinct, with a collective voice, and rejecting capitalism because it rejected humans in the first place. Harron's perspective shows men who exist individually, but whose existence are lead at the expenses of a social conscience, or any conception of love or family. It's all about consumption, competition, buying, eating, trading, a world where even women are treated like products whether prostitutes or strippers or disposable fiancées. These men didn't fight the system but embraced it, men being wolves to men.Patrick Bateman took it a bit too literally: anyone above him is a dead man, anyone who admires or loves his Alpha aura might get away, someone with no goal whatsoever, no philosophy of life, deserves to be killed. Destruction is what connects both ""Fight Club"" and ""American Psycho"" but if in the former, the mayhem was supposed to build a new order, the message was still contradicted by its homoerotic undertones and its constant gaze on Brad Pitt's beautiful abs. The film was tantalizing our voyeuristic tendencies. We get the same gaze on Bale, when he's taking a shower and narrates his cosmetic morning routine, but it's devoid of passion, it's cold and soulless and his naked body is often associated to scenes of horror that connects between the two worlds of fantasy: violence and nudity. It's just as if the real motive of the 'Fight Club' was to create a sense of belonging, to build a collective male body instead of restoring justice.Mary Harron deconstructs the myth of masculinity through the portrayal of many metrosexual men as self-important and gossipy as the Beverly Hills housewives. Bateman has everything: a steady and gratifying job, a huge apartment in New York, a beautiful fiancée (Reese Witherspoon) and yet he's devoured by a constant urge to destroy whatever can spoil this feeling of perfection, even someone whose business card looks better. The film blends toward horror and comedy with rather gruesome episodes, but there's never any attenuating circumstance, Bateman has no moral alibi. He was raised by pop-culture, Reagan, and considers killing something as casual as ordering a hamburger.It might be the extreme point from which we understand the inconceivable: why would someone who'd accept that thousands of people die from a transaction accept to be ethical? Why would someone who's at the top of the human pyramid, decides to have casual sex with an average Jane or accepts marital commitment? Why would he indulge to normal behavior? That's the point, the higher climb as a man and the looser will be your sense of moral, (look at the Weinstein or Epstein scandals) and maybe Bateman, whether he commits the actual crimes or dream of them, is the embodiment of both masculinity and capitalism dark side.And Bale's extraordinary performance is crucial because he never tries to make his character sympathetic when he confronts us to our potential for degeneracy and hypocrisy. ""American Psycho"" is an underrated 2000s film, oddly prophetic, revealing new depths at each viewing.","

"george.schmidt","27 April 2004","American PSYCHO (2000) **** Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon, Samantha Mathis, Chloe Sevigny, Justin Theroux, Matt Ross, Cara Seymour, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage, Guinevere Turner. Filmmaker Mary Harron attempts the impossible: adapting, with co-scribe Turner, Bret Easton Ellis' controversial blood-drenched satirical 1991 novel with surprising success. Instead of relying on the ghastly acts as the focal point in diluting the gore factor (the audience must fill in the blanks for each act not unlike the original 'Psycho') she instead makes Patrick Bateman – Jack The Ripper in Armani - (Bale in a mesmerizing, darkly funny turn) a hypnotically scary 'merger and acquisitions' (or is that 'murder and executions'?) Wall Street proto-yuppie living large in the late Reagan Eighties to the extreme and caving in to his inner voices by killing at random with elan and irony tongue-through-cheek (trust me you'll never hear Huey Lewis and The News' 'Hip To Be Square' in quite the same way) aplomb. Dare I compare him to 'A Clockwork Orange's Alex? Sure, he's just as maladjusted but not so much at blaming society, although the film does underscore throughout the absurdities of class warfare and contemporary thrillseeking (extreme sports being who has the better looking business card) forsaking identity, which is the key point here even if it means splitting a skull with an axe every now and then. Well scripted and acted ; no easy feat.","

"Kdosda_Hegen","22 April 2020","Possibly the most pretentious character in film history. The film delves into so many themes like materialism, hypocrisy, manipulation, influence, trends and much more. All themes are viewed from the protagonist's perspective yet all of them are about him really. But what makes this different from other films is that here the protagonist is self-aware of some of all his misdeeds. The protagonist is so complex that even he himself isn't sure if he knows himself. This is some serious work where every scene could be analysed for ages of what it all means. This is top-tier writing and execution. The film leaves dozens of questions unanswered, yet provides us with enough information to fill the gaps however we want.","

"arminhage","8 August 2014","I've never read the book so I do not make a comment whether it was a good adaptation which if it was, I'm certain the book is also awful! Movie has no hero, no nemesis, no direction. Audience does not know what to expect. I would say the whole story is comparable to a movie like ""The Great Gatsby"" a pointless body of motion picture trying to lure audience with scenes of ultra rich extravaganza! Movie is mostly talking heads with limited action, 75%+ of the movie is plain exposition, explaining everything but something relevant to the movie, absolutely nothing to root for. OK, it is a motion picture about the daily life of a rich psycho who kills people... so what? What is the message? What is the resolve? Where is the structure? Screenplay never followed the approved Hollywood guidelines, one simple flat line from start to finish so I wonder how did it pass the studio executives into production. The exposition was so weak that the audience may not realize that the movie occurs in late 80s not early 2000s, apparently the director assumed that everybody read the book and now wishes to see it on big screen. I barely finished the movie, it was pure waste of time and I do not recommend anybody to waste her time!","

"acidburn-10","7 September 2023","'American Psycho' is a brilliant horror satire that blends disturbing imagery with social commentary about the superficial and materialism aspects of the 80's. The movie does a fantastic job of adapting the novel by Brett Easton Ellis by focusing more on the satirical aspect of the book, yet still manages to include plenty of violent set pieces and thanks to a smartly written script, superb direction and an iconic leading performance, everything comes together beautifully and creates an entertaining viewing with layers beneath the surface.The plot = Set in the 1980's Wall Street era, a wealthy investment executive Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) has everything going for him, but he's also a psychopath and decides to act out his violent fantasies.The narrative is somewhat loosely told and plays secondary to the satire, but thanks to strong production values, stunning cinematography and the overall tone of the flick the movie is smart as it is engaging and all of that is thanks to the amazing central performance by Christian Bale whose absolutely perfect in this role, he delivers the look and delivery the character needed, a lesser actor would have taken the movie down with him, but thankfully Christian Bale is one of the most talented and diverse actors out there and this was a star making turn for him.Overall 'American Psycho' is an excellent feature through and through and still holds up well after more than 20 years. Clever, witty and horrifying, this movie is a treat and a modern day classic.","

"poolandrews","17 June 2007","American Psycho is set in New York where Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) the Vice President of a Wall Street banking firm enjoys a hugely successful life with a beautiful apartment, loads of money, the best clothes, the finest food & all the luxuries anyone could ever want. However under the calm & calculating exterior Patrick has psychological problems as he has a violent blood-lust which he satisfies by killing people he has contempt for & he also likes perverted sex sessions with prostitutes (then again who wouldn't?). His latest victim Paul Allen (Jared Leto) is missed & his fiancé hires private detective Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe) to find him, will Patrick be exposed as the homicidal maniac that he is or can he get away with it...This American Canadian co-production was co-written & directed by Mary Harron & I have to say that I didn't think that much of it despite it's reputation. The social satire laden script by Harron & Guinevere Turner who played Elisabeth the high class prostitute in the film was based on the controversial novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis & I just don't 'get' it's appeal or why anyone would particularly want to sit down & watch it, overall I think it's quite a dull & repetitive film with some nice dialogue & a few decent scenes which save it from total banality. Some of Bateman's monologues along with the amusing yet pointless speeches about the merits of 80's pop groups & the style of people's business cards are pretty funny at times if trivial & if your looking for some sex & nudity then American Psycho might do it for you. I was expecting more in the horror department if I'm honest, there's barely a drop of blood in it & certainly nothing graphic, pretty much all of the character's are very unlikeable & one dimensional with Willem Dafoe's cop getting about three scenes before he is completely dropped & I also thought it was boring with pretty much the same thing happening scene after scene. I wasn't impressed by the ambiguous ending either which tries to be clever but I just found it frustrating as it never clarifies if it was all in Bateman's imagination. Personally I didn't think it was anything to write home about but there does seem to be a lot of people out there who like it, so maybe I just went into it with the wrong expectations & quite simply it's just not for me.Director Harron does OK, there's a nice elegance to the way this is shot with nice camera slick moves. The film nails the whole 80's yuppie thing very well as these unlikeable people spend money like water, care for nothing or no one but themselves & have beautiful apartments for which I'm very jealous. I found myself becoming bored with all the yuppie satire going on & again it just felt very repetitive. I wouldn't say there's anything scary here or even particularly that violent although there are a couple of fairly strong sex scenes.With a supposed budget of about $8,000,000 this looks nice enough with sleek & stylish cinematography but what does that matter when the film did so little for me? Set in New York it was actually mostly filmed in Ontario in Canada. The acting is OK, I don't really know if I liked Christian Bale's performance or not. Willem Dafoe is utterly wasted in a nothing part.American Psycho is trying to be a complex dark thriller which wants to say something about 80's upper class society in New York, I'm sorry but weren't the 80's like 20 years ago? I'm sure there are many out there who like or even love this film & I'm proud to say right here & now that I'm not one of them, average at best & an irrelevant bore at worst. Followed by the straight-to-video American Psycho 2: All American Girl (2002) which has no connection to this at all apart from a vague Patrick Bateman reference.","

"judealexharnett","3 December 2023","This movie is absolutely absurd. Patrick Bateman is a literal psychopath yet is living in a world even crazier than he is. I'm gonna be honest, I'm not 100 percent certain I know what's going on but I do believe this movie is up to interpretation to a certain extent. Patrick Bateman as a character is very interesting. The dude is crazy, yet he's also extremely meticulous, cold and calculating. Despite all this he's extremely materialistic and envious, like in scenes such as where all the buisnessmen are showing they're cards. Which all happens to say vice president btw, another indication that Bateman is crazy.The ending was quite good as well. Did bateman's lawyer have lunch with Paul Allen, or was it just another generic, sociopathic businessmen? Either way this movie is definitely a fun little commentary on American buissness man and a pretty thought provoking one at that. I don't think it would be ridiculous to say that this is Christian bales best preformance. 9.8/10.","

"edantheman","22 May 2013","When Bret Easton Ellis's novel 'American Psycho' was released in 1991, many accused him and his work of misogyny. It isn't hard to see why: female characters are depicted as either vacuous or stupid and are usually mutilated or killed by Wall Street banker Patrick Bateman, an undoubtedly misogynistic protagonist. Which is why noted feminist Mary Harron fought tooth and nail to direct Guinevere Turner's film adaptation with Christian Bale as her leading man, after creative pairings such as Oliver Stone and Leonardo Dicaprio and David Cronenberg and Brad Pitt fell through. And how inspired her vision is! While a male director may have been impressed by the Nietzchean aspect of Bateman, Harron regards him as a hopelessly vain and emotionally underdeveloped young man, weak for being unable to control his violent impulses. One suspects a male director would not have let his camera linger on our antihero in the shower for quite so long as well.Christian Bale veers from smarm to plain evil in every scene. A vapid grin will flash upon his face just as quickly as the light will glint off the side of the axe he ploughs into a colleague's face. As the late critic Roger Ebert said of his performance (couldn't have put it better myself), ""there is no instinct for self-preservation here"". A far cry from the pretentious 'Dark Knight' films of late, then. With an emotional range of, as the character expresses it, 'greed and disgust', he doesn't provide us with much to relate to as a human being but as the actor himself has said, ""he's certainly a guy you'd like to eavesdrop on"". More so than the countless other vapid shells of inhumanity surrounding him, who often have no lines to read but serve to remind us that Patrick Bateman is, in his own words ""an abstraction... something illusory..."" In a movie about endemic consumerism, everyone has been made-up to look indistinct within their scene, with nearly identical glasses, haircuts and suits. Hair and make-up also deserve particular credit for creating the monster's face. A glimmering sheen of sweat on his otherwise perfectly composed visage tells us when he's 'on the verge of frenzy' and a single tremor in his herb-mint facial mask of sanity reminds us it is always about to slip. His fanatical devotion to a rigorous exercise routine, balanced diet and daily beautification regimen borders on the religious. Never has the lipstick and rouge been applied so subtly yet significantly as here.To aurally demonstrate to us how much men have 'evolved', in the scene where our WASPs compare business cards, SFX designer Benjamin Cheah employs the sound of a sword being removed from it's sheath to draw parallels with the equivalent practice of their knight ancestors of Britain and the Netherlands in Medieval times. It reveals, terrifyingly, how little man has really evolved since. A soundtrack that wouldn't seem out of place in any piece of Hollywood fluff of it's era serves only to heighten our protagonist's psychopathy here.Whether it's Phil Collins' epic meditation on intangibility 'Invisible Touch' or Whitney Houston's ode to monogamy and commitment 'The Greatest Love of All', Bateman clearly likes the product they're selling him: life, security and happiness (without the pursuit –an AmEx credit card will do). He would value a wife and son much in the same way as he would a new Louis Vuitton watch or Giorgio Armani suit. An item is an item to him: something he has to have. When he gives his dinner guests the sanctimonious lecture on world hunger, he's merely imitating something he's heard on TV. Content means nothing, form is everything (""...inside doesn't matter..."").After implausibly shooting it out in the street with the cops, Bateman crashes in his office where he tearfully confesses his many crimes, mostly ones unseen by us, to his lawyer over the answering machine (the detachment of the 80s now seems relatively intimate). The next day, however, a prescription-drug mood-controlled Bateman confronts him in a downtown bar only to find that his guilty voicemail has been mistaken for a joke. Meanwhile his secretary Jean, the only sympathetic character of the story, peruses his business diary of gory doodlings in the film's only scene removed from the perspective of our own 'psycho'. So, which is it short for? Have we all been witness to the inner-ravellings of a psychotic? –that particular strain of unreliable narrator being a popular theme at the time, e.g. 'Fight Club', 'Memento'. It would seem unlikely that Harron, or Ellis for that matter, would want to waste ninety minutes of our time studying a character who, by his own admission, is 'simply not there'. Not that it isn't a character study.Rather, it is one of a nation. A singularly American psychopath. There is great significance in Ronald Reagan delivering his address to the nation regarding the Iran-Contra scandal on the TV moments before Bateman confesses to camera. In the speech, Reagan denied having knowledge of the unlawful dealings while refusing to apologise for his ignorance. When Nixon announced his resignation apropos the Watergate scandal, the American people were outraged. Fast-forward thirteen years and they were too sedated by psychotropic drugs and MTV to give a sh*t that a shadow government had been selling arms to Islamic militants in Iran with the proceeds funding anti-communist death squads in Nicaragua, all in their name. Much the same can be said of the yuppies depicted herein; who claim to have dined with Paul Allen after Bateman killed him, fail to hear his sinister homicidal remarks over drinks or misinterpret his deadly advances. They mistake each other for different people throughout, which would seem to uphold his psychopathy. The film is best viewed as an allegory for the all-consuming male vanity and self-absorption of the time period. The beginning of the end of patriarchy.This review has meant something.","

"fedor8","30 December 2006","Most of the gory details were avoided, which is probably the only interesting thing in a book which delves on the Reagan era and how evil and egotistical it was - if the movie is anything to go by. What a boring old left-wing point to make. How original and insightful! We are presented with a psychopath who is supposed to be funny as well as menacing. To mix satire or even comedy with this genre is truly stupid and cannot come to any good. Plus, a couple of scenes are dumb in the ""Nightwatch"" or ""Copycat"" or even ""Hitcher"" vein: Bateman kills a fleeing hooker by throwing a running chainsaw down a flight of stairs - as if he spent all his life practicing for such an occasion. Of course, no one - in that large New York building - is there to see or hear the prostitute's screams or to see and hear a blood-soaked Bateman running through the hallways nude and with a chainsaw in his hands. (But perhaps the unfeeling, insensitive 80s are to blame and its selfish 80s inhabitants.) It is also unexplained how exactly he manages to clean the blood and drag the body up five or six floors to his flat without anyone seeing him and without leaving a bloody mess all over the place. But the nonsense doesn't end there. He also kills an old woman because she saw him pointing a gun at a cat (plenty of stray cats in Manhattan, of course) and after that he goes on a killing spree after which he weeps and confesses his crimes to a lawyer by phone. A psychopath with a guilty conscience?! Later, he meets the lawyer and tells him that he is Bateman and that the phone message was no joke, and that he killed the character Paul. To this the lawyer says that he had dinner with Paul twice in the last ten days! What the hell is that?? Did he imagine it all? Yet there is no indication at all that he imagined it all. And even if he had: what's the point?! Plus, he doesn't seem like the type of serial killer who would be dumb enough to try and kill his secretary, especially since a detective already hangs around him a lot.It was clear to me from the very start of the preparations for the making of this movie that there was a lack of seriousness about it: they wanted Di Caprio to play the lead! Di Caprio the serial killer. No wonder the movie turned out so bad. Considering this, then maybe Bale wasn't such a bad choice. They actually fixed Bale's very English teeth so that they would look ""perfect"", i.e. yuppie-like, for the role. Instead, it looks as if he is wearing one of those very cheap, fake, bright-white vampire teeth (minus the fangs). So what have we learned from this mess? Serial-killer thrillers are hitting new lows (i.e. highs) in stupidity, and bad novels should not be filmed. This piece of crap even has a sequel.","

"ronakkotian","6 August 2021","When I think of Christian Bale's performances, two come to mind: Bruce Wayne in The Dark Knight Trilogy and Patrick Bateman in American Psycho.American Psycho follows Patrick Bateman, a wealthy businessman in the 1980's that hides his alter ego from the people he knows during the day and enjoys his murderous tendencies at night.Easily one of my favourite films of all time, American Psycho is a film I won't ever get tired of. To be clear, American Psycho isn't meant to be viewed as a serious thriller but rather a dark comedy. The film does such an excellent job introducing us to Bateman's persona as we really learn how narcissistic and superficial of a person he really is. It leaves great hints into the violent thoughts he has at the start and slowly descends into the chaos in a way that feels organic. Not only that, the film provides us with very clever commentary on the self-adulation of businessmen during the simplest of scenes such as a group of them discussing business cards. The direction, sound design and acting all combined tells us all about Bateman and his co-workers. Mary Harron directed this story with immense skill. She balances the violence with enough comedy that somehow makes it hilarious rather than disturbing and the script, filled with memorable sequences and quotable lines, attribute to that tone.The creation of the 80's is also an aspect I admire. From the visual representation of New York City to the monologues on music from Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins and Whitney Houston, all of this meshes to create an accurate representation of that time period. When it comes to performances, Christian Bale steals the show. One of his best performances to date, Bale's portrayal of Patrick Bateman is brilliant on so many levels. With the tone he uses for certain lines to reveal the character's narcissism to the deep, dark and piercing effect he creates once he goes about violent tendencies, Bale's acting is top-notch. Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto are also great in their short roles.American Psycho is a unique character study that works incredibly due to the synergy between Mary Harron's direction, the script and Christian Bale's powerhouse of a performance. It's a beautifully constructed piece of work that will remain as one of my favourite films of all time.","

"ctcrmcou","28 March 2008","Finally saw the movie - it was one of five free blu-rays in a rebate with Sony Playstation.Many comments wondered if it was real or not.There are several giveaways that the murders were fantasies. Many times Bateman says things that are evil and violent to someone, but are heard by the recipient of the comments as something else.The outright murders with no witnesses, blowing up the cops vehicles for an easy escape, dragging bodies and blood through lobbies, the cleaned up apartment with no dead bodies in sight, no investigators or police crime scene tape where there should have been, .... it goes on and on. Don't forget the final scene with his lawyer. The fantasies were manifested only in the notebook found in his desk by his secretary. I'm happy she was ""spared"".I found the lack of pursuit by Willem Dafoe (the detective) to be a letdown. The initial questioning of Bateman was definitely right out of the original Psycho, and I found this confrontation as the start of a great ""gonna getcha"" in the end. But it never happened.The only question is, why was a detective asking Bateman questions in the first place, or, was the idea of a missing colleague the spark for a fantasy, just shown after the fact.I loved the business card one-upsmanship. It shows how shallow rich vice presidents (about a dozen were there?) are, and what losers they really are in life as people. Misery loves company, I guess. Reminded me a lot of the yuppies in Trading Places. Bored and prissy. Although they think they are living the ""good life"", but contribute nothing in the end.It was a fun movie, probably sparks our fantasies about what we'd like to do with the scum of this earth - but that's why it's only a movie.","

"Jacques98","2 November 2008","If there is a single movie that suffuses as the poster-child for the countless ""What was the point of that?"" movies, it's American Psycho. It's not necessary bad, it's just boring and pointless. It's the kind of movie that will leave the average person thinking about their laundry when the credits roll rather than the movie itself. In other blunter words, the movie is wholesale forgettable from opening to closing. If you know anything about real-life serial killers, or have seen any other cliché serial killer movie, you've seen this. Hundreds of times.It opens up just like every other first-person narrative movie, and some lines even made me wonder if they were copied directly from Fight Club. Regardless of when the two original novels were written, I think this just proves the insane unoriginality of both.Speaking of unoriginality, American Psycho is nothing but one long, bloated serial killer cliché with nothing to differentiate it from the countless others just like it. The main character is a mix of Hannibal Lector and your average no-name B-movie serial killer. He does exactly what every other serial killer ever does: kill, have sex, and kill having sex. He's a dull cliché with legs. (And a butt, if you want me to mention the constant immature use of rear nudity that has no point but to make the 13-year-old girls horny.) There is no real plot, just, as I said, kill and have sex, and that's the ""brilliant, masterful"" plotting that everyone is speaking of. Kill, sex, kill, sexI think we know what sells in America. That's why American Psycho is just so safe. It's a safe idea that has been used hundreds of timeskill, sexand was destine to get great reviews because it plays so safe. I think we've learned by now that safe movies get the critic's good scores, and safe movies sell. Am I really the only one who gets it? American Psycho is a movie for safe pansies who's idea of a ""brilliant, masterful"" plot is: kill, sex, kill.But with all the killing, I was left wondering: where is all this gore everyone is speaking of? How is this gory? Every single kill is off-screen. I've seen low-budget 60's horror movies that show more gore on screen. There isn't a single moment of brutality. There is less blood on screen than your average TV show. Did I mention this movie plays it all 100% safe? If everything I just mentioned wasn't bad enough, let me move on to the boring factor. The entire run time is a long, drawn-out talking scene. It goes from one conversation scene to another, with less action than your average drama. Maybe that's because, no matter what you want to believe, American Psycho is a drama. It isn't a horror moviejust the idea of typing that makes me laughand it isn't an action movie. It's just a cliché, dull drama.The only good I can manage to scrounger up: - Bale knows how to act. - The chainsaw scene was interesting.Now, back to the bad for my conclusion. American Psycho is a safe, boring, cliché drama and nothing more. It has some humor, but it's all humor you've heard before. There is no intellectual meaning, unlike what some seem to think, and it isn't entertaining. It's so forgettable the exact thing I thought when the credits came on screen was: ""I need to order some pizza . . ."" and didn't even remember I watched it until I sat down to write this review the next morning. There are countless movies out there exactly like this, and I sometimes wonder if I'm the only person alive who even gets that there actually ARE interesting, entertaining, original movies out there to watch. Why did I waste my time on American Psycho? 0/10","

"Amyth47","24 December 2019","My Rating : 9/10Christian Bale is PERFECT as Patrick Bateman.Set in the 1980s, the book follows the story of a 27-year-old Harvard graduate named Patrick Bateman, who goes on a killing spree and murders ""twenty, maybe forty people.""'American Psycho' is anything you want it to be; glossy and superficial, or deep and meaningful. The question is : Do you look at things from the same narrow angle as Patrick Bateman does? If so, then the movie is not for you...The film looks to examine our own distorted points of view or detachments from reality. Like Patrick Bateman, we may be trapped craving the approval of others and denying ourselves the ability to distinguish fantasies from our reality. People are obsessed with how the others perceive them likewise in American Psycho Bateman achieves no catharsis, he's trapped in his own personal hell because he requires the recognition of the other yuppies to confirm his identity as a murderer. The irony is that Bateman's real crimes may as well be fantasy. The lack of acknowledging his reality drives Bateman further into madness and existential despair. It's about yuppie culture, the melding of identity, and the craving to stand out from a superficial homogenized society.This is a great movie. Look for the subtext under the dialogue.Highest Recommendation.","

"rockian","16 July 2001","How anyone can categorize this film as a masterpiece amazes me.  There was a perfect opportunity to develop a possible thrilling confrontation of Willem Dafoe's character and Patrick Batemen.  Yet, Dafoe's character disappears.I watched this piece of garbage twice to see if I could figure out the ending.  I'm embarrassed that I wasted this time trying to put some sort of meaning to such a lame film.  Just because the film makes fun of the self-centeredness of the '80s doesn't mean this is a good film.What is more disturbing than the thought that someone would think this would be an interesting film is that someone thinks there should be a sequel!I give this a -10 out of 10.  I'd rather chew on aluminum foil than watch this garbage again.","

"jamalio9","12 June 2003","There are numerous things wrong with this otherwise faithfull adaptation in terms of it's structure, plot and ability to portray a strong focus on it's lead character (although heavily watered down). For starters, it is far too tame. You may argue that a lot of the explicit sex and violence in the book was unnecessary but the truth is the Patrick Bateman in the book is obsessed with detail, perfection and routine, so he explains popular culture, food and restaurants and bathing products with the same explicit nature as he describes his killings with his victims and the sex he has with them beforehand. This was missing. I never once heard Patrick Bateman describe what he likes to do to his female victims in sickening detail. Although this was sick it does serve a purpose and would have proven to be a very uniquely cinematic function that would be very disturbing and almost something we have never seen before in a film. Plus the fact it would sidestep the censors as its not physical violence being committed, merely psychological. They lost something unique in this. Also Patrick Bateman in the book does some unbelievably f***** up things to his victims which makes it hard to read. That's why there was all the controversy. The film does NOT have this effect and it should at least have been shocking, and the fact that there was no controversy surrounding the films release sums it up quite well. It's like a book that is really heartbreaking and sad and brings you to tears but the adapted film doesn't make you feel this way- you often think that something important was missing and the film makers have missed the point.Secondly were the production values. In the book you imagine the locations- Bateman's apartment, his office, the parties they attend, the nightclubs and restaurants, to exceed anything we could ever imagine and associate with 'rich' in reality. In the book they are lavish, far more than we could ever imagine. Now its fairly obvious that this film is relatively low budget and as result it suffers a little by showing us locations we would associate with upper middle class in a TV sitcom, not upper class people who have that sense of materialistic achievement the likes of which we never knew existed. And it's a little too obvious that most of it was shot in a film studio. Many of the characters in the book would frown upon the living conditions of what the characters in the film have.Thirdly was Patrick Bateman himself. He was never this much of a geek in the book. He was a very powerful, ruthless man, who describes all that sense of materialism that is apparently appealing to most humans, whilst displaying a sense of genuine animosity and sinister ness that you would almost regard as 'inhuman'. A lot of people miss the point of this; sometimes your confused as to whether he is human or some form of demon and it plays with your perceptions a little, thereby proving to be the most disturbing element of the book itself. Patrick Bateman in the book is actually very well respected and his possibly so far at the top of his game its no surprise he appears to be inhuman. In the film he is a run of the mill yuppie that is a bit of a loser compared to his mates. In the film he does what he does 'cause he feels he has no choice, in the book he does what he does 'cause he gets such a kick out of it and is such a spoilt brat that enjoying the most expensive things in life are not enough for him. He is so disgusted with meals, clothes, other products etc that don't cost thousands of dollars and aren't the best it is actually quite unbelievable yet interesting, and you get the sense that he spends a thousand just to walk out his door. You don't get a sense of what an expensive life Patrick Bateman lives in the film. Also in the book he really is a ladies man and wherever he goes he always gets a chicks phone number- which would lead onto inevitable consequences. In the film he often has to rely on hookers- one of which the ugly blonde one, who is so ugly the character in the book wouldn't even look at her (the book version of his character is VERY fussy about his women and wouldn't have sex with her unless she was 100% perfect looking, and NOT one that has the characteristics of a yorkshire terrier). In short, the book version of Patrick Bateman would have eaten the one in the film (literally alive) for breakfast in terms of greed and corruption and wanting the best of everything.Fourthly was the scope of the film, again a fault with the films production values. In the book the characters get up to far more interesting things- conference meetings, huge parties, rock concerts, opera and so one, in the film all they ever seem to do is go to the same nightclub and restaurants and sit around and talk. As a result the film shows little achievement as to some of the excitement the characters get up to. That's also what was disturbing about the book, it shows a lifestyle that these yuppies have that entices you and almost makes you feel a little envious of what they get up to. In the film the characters lives are just boring, plain and simple.Last of all (and thank god after all my bitching) the other characters in the book are far more complex and interesting than the 1 dimensional representation we get of them in the film. All of them are obsessed about the same things as Bateman who isn't such a loner and makes you question whether or not they get up to the same things as Bateman despite the fact that they give the impression otherwise. All of them are vain and are obsessed with looking good and getting the best out of everything. Again in the film they are just traditional yuppies.Well I'm sorry I've bored you after this lengthy comparison but if you have read the book long ago as I have; and expected something special and monumental as the book was, rather than a film that was too small scale and lacked the passion and ambition it so desperately needed, I'm sure you'd agree. There should have been moments in this film that really shocked you into realising what a human being is capable of in terms of committing acts of evil towards others but alas, all we got was a naked guy running down a corridor wearing sneakers and wielding a chainsaw. I feel that the strongest thing about the film is easily Christian Bales' outstanding performance, and you wonder what could have been achieved in the hands of a greater director like Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma or even Martin Scorsese, who had a bigger budget and a little more verve and daringness to do it more justice, rather than Mary Hannon's merely competent but pedestrian and un-cinematic take on the book","

"emryse","20 June 2021","I watched this film yesterday evening and haven't been able to stop thinking about it since, it gripped me in a way that not many films do and stuck in my mind.The story is very simple, it follows Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale, as a seemingly normal man who murders hookers and homeless people in his spare time, the cinematography is simplistic but it feels like it works perfectly with the story of what everyone assumes is a normal man, the music choices all compliment the movie sublimely, adding to every scene they are in and the cast is all pretty strong, this film though is really carried by one aspect. Christian Bale.He puts in one of my favourite performances of all time as a narcissistic, violent, sociopath, someone you can't help but hate. Bale perfectly captures the duality of Bateman, trying to fit in but struggling to keep up the charade and every time the mask drops you truly believe that he has gone crazy, the physicality and dialogue come together perfectly to give us a simply unforgettable performance. Without Bale I don't think this film would be anywhere near as good and this movie cements him as one of my all time favourite actors.Some people have problems with the ending and I originally felt similar but I think it encapsulates how even though Bateman is the villain, everyone around him is responsible for his actions as well, that's the best way I can put it without getting into spoilers. If you haven't watched this film yet, please do, if only for Christian Bale's amazing performance. 10/10.","

"Dr. Gore","3 January 2003","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*My friend and I went out to see this one.  The movie started and there were scenes of Manhattan over very cheery music.  I thought something was odd. Then the movie shifted to Edward Norton at a bar drinking his brains out. Hey - wait a minute.  Edward Norton is the American Psycho?  The whole theater starts howling and screaming.  They had put ""Keeping the Faith"" through the projector by mistake.  My friend and I were screaming, ""People please! Quiet! I'm trying to watch the movie!""  Suffice to say, the crowd was a bit agitated by the time the right movie started.I thought ""American Psycho"" was hilarious.  Most people who were there did not.  I think that the majority of the audience thought it was going to be a straight slasher movie.  At least some semblance of a horror flick.  It's not.  Satire is the right word for it. Christian Bale is fantastic as the Psycho Bateman. He's a smarmy Wall Street fake who kills people in his other life.  Or does he?  The movie leaves it ambiguous as to whether Bateman actually killed anybody.  I assumed it was all in his head.  Fantasies of murder and mayhem kept Bateman as sane as possible in the fake, back stabbing world he lived in.It's a funny movie.  Just don't expect a horror flick.","

"RockPortReview","6 February 2010","American Psycho 02/02/2010American Psycho is based on the insanely gory and controversial book by Brett Easton Ellis. The author has had several of his books made into movies such as ""Less than Zero"", ""Rules of Attraction"", and 2009's ""The Informers"". American Psycho is a book some thought to be unfilmable, but writer and director Mary Harron brought the vile character of Patrick Bateman to life in movie that is more of a dark comedy than your average horror movie.Harron was also able to get such name actors as Reese Witherspoon, Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto. Not to mention Christian Bale, a largely unknown actor at the time, who landing the role of Patrick. Although Bale has been acting since the late 80's in such films as ""Newsies"" and ""Swing Kids"", it wasn't until ""Psycho"" that he really started to appear on people's radar. His performance was nothing short of spectacular. If you really want to see a shocking comparison of his work, watch ""The Machinist"" and ""Batman Begins"" back to back. Bale is a man fiercely loyal and committed to his craft.Set in the late 1980's New York financial district, American Psycho is a vicious satire on 80's materialism and extreme narcissism. Patrick Bateman is an investment banker for Pierce & Pierce, where everybody looks the same and it's all about how big your ego is. In an early scene we see Patrick, in his high rise apartment, go though his morning routine and in a voice over he says, ""There is an idea of a Patrick Batemen, but I'm simply not there"" If there is any emotion Patrick shows its greed and disgust. When his nightly blood lust starts to take over and he states ""my mask of sanity is about to slip."" He is sent over the edge by a business card. All the guys are showing off their new cards when colleague Paul Allen sends Patrick into a panic with a card that is better than his. This cannot stand and Paul eventually gets and axe to the face.To fill out the 80's vibe there is a lot of hit music played and talked about during some of most important scenes in the film. Huey Lewis and the News, Phil Collins and Whitney Houston to name a few.Reese Witherspoon has a small part as Evelyn, Patrick's so-called girlfriend, who is always badgering him to get married. Patrick really couldn't care less about her and is only going out with her to ""fit in"". Besides he has a mistress named Courtney. Jean his secretary is the most down to earth and ""real"" person in the film and in Patrick's life. Jean agrees to dinner with him, but at his apartment he can't go through with killing her and tells her to leave. Although when it comes to prostitutes he has no problem killing them. In one of the most insanely crazy scenes I've ever seen, Patrick fully nude and covered in blood chases a prostitute through his apartment building with a chainsaw. Bale completely inhabits this role and is totally insane. The final third of the film shows that Patrick has completely lost it and bears his soul to his lawyer's answering machine. What happens the next morning really drives home the themes of the film. The novel is extremely explicit in the violence and gore, while the film mostly leaves it to your imagination. The real horror comes from the character of Patrick Bateman, who seems to channel Hannibal Lecter in some scenes. There was an absolutely dreadful sequel made in 2002. It didn't have any of the cast and crew from the original and is just pure trash. The original film made my list for best films of the decade for the 2000's and continues to be one of my personal favorite films.","

"haydenluz","11 April 2020","Mary Harron's depiction of Bret Easton Ellis novel, American Psycho, is a true, original MASTERPIECE! The most beautiful part about this movie, was the ambiguous approach Mary Harron took. Her direction and story telling had a dark comedic tone, with so many open ended outcomes, having great detailed narration from Christian Bale. She also utilized a lot of foreshadowing, allowing things to really brew up into a fantastic story. Mary Harron used a lot of focused, close up shots, to really display the raw emotions in each character.Christian Bale is an actor, man. I personally connected with a side of his character, because of my OCD nature, quick, sly remarks, and my blunt tone (just not to his extreme). His character is a real narcissist jerk, that is super high octane. Christian Bale did a phenomenal job getting into this role, working out, and really filling the role as an inside psychopath. He paid close attention to detail, really displaying, and explaining the true characteristics of a psychopath. The fact that Bale didn't get nominated for his performance, is a little absurd, considering this is one of his BEST performances. This was mainly a character study of Patrick Bateman, but we also had a lot of great performances across the board, for the supporting cast in Willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas, Samantha Mathis and more.The screenplay by Mary Harron & Guinevere Turner was terrific! They really focused on making this a dark comedy movie, along with the drama/thriller/horror aspect. All of the dialogues had so much intelligent word play, having countless uncensored vulgar conversations, with many righteous remarks. Though there are some scenes that are genuinely horrific, Harron & Turner didn't shy away from incorporating consistent dark humor laughs, that came from the soul.The action was brilliantly utilized, not overdoing it, being very graphic and unsettling. The way Mary Harron ties all the action in, in the final act, left my jaw on the floor, and made me rethink everything!","

"LightDarkness14","6 July 2011","American Psycho is another one of THOSE movies. You know, the ones with a high-rating that just happen to suck.Lots of people rant about the downfall of horror after 1999 and although I have a lot of favorites from the 2000's I have too say they speak the truth. Horror nowadays is basically bad acting, sprinkled with bits of gore and vulgar language. This horrible movement began with this film.American Phsyco is about a 27 year-old business man named Patrick Bateman. Patrick is popular with his friends, drowns in women every night, dines at the most expensive restaurants and has a very nice business card. But what his co-workers don't know is that his smirk hides the life of a dedicated pshycopath.The films holds your interest for a good while with scenes of gratious gore and plenty of black comedy, but it's not long before we realize that American Psycho is stuck in a time-warp. The same thing happens every day. Patrick goes to work, barely conceals his psychopathic alter ego from his friends, picks up a whore, has sex and then kills the whore. Our reward? To see him do it all over again, except next time with different bland dialouge.AP had potiental, and some bits are interesting. But the final product is quite a mess. Horror fans should at least give it a viewing though. After all, some people enjoy crap. 4/10","

"dataconflossmoor","19 October 2007","Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman who is a stockbroker, a successful stockbroker, in the eighties!! What does that mean? The sky was the limit!! BMW's and $180.00 bottles of wine were everyday tokens of a very leveraged period of economic expansion!! The titillating taste of raw capitalism made Patrick Bateman morally oblivious to the lethal consequences of his reckless actions!! It was all about chic restaurants that were approved by the New York Times, and, sexual proclivities which satiated Bateman's immediate hedonistic desires!! No, he was not telling a six year old kid who was looking at a plate full of mixed vegetables to ""Don't just stare at it, eat it"" .. You'll have to watch the movie!!Here are the ground rules to the 1980's, be a smashing success in the stock market, and, as a result, be a serial killer!! Makes sense to me!! These self centered obsessions now materialized as a 24/7 preoccupation for Patrick Bateman.. His callous fruition had no tolerance for the mundane, was this illogical? For the real world, yes, for Bateman, of course not!! This film gives the movie audience an enticing invitation to the irrational thought patterns of Patrick Bateman.. I took them up on it, and indulged the entire film with a sort of heinous empathy for Christian Bale's character. I totally understood that he was the American psycho who had an intensely high testosterone level which was motivated by an exhilarating avariciousness!! The rationale being, ""I work out"" ""I make $250,000.00 a year"", I am always seen at the right places, and last, but certainly not least, ""I live in New York""... Do all of these things make me better? YES!!!.. SO NOW!!! My favorite hobby is being a very creative and utterly unmitigated assassin!!!The eighties were great times, the ""greed is good"" philosophy was predominant, everyone was incredibly self centered, (I'm just being honest!!) It became a competitive instance of which people were better at it!!! Sort of like now, only today, it is a concept that is not all that new to us!! The film ""American Psycho"" translates to unscrupulous chicanery being the end result of a nauseating arrogance... All of us are human, we fall prey to personal motives and pecuniary fixations, it is just a matter of which people have the proper credentials to implement these desires the most expeditiously!! The 1980's YUPPIE tenet perennially professed the concept of ""Take the term Wall Street Mogul seriously, or, be bludgeoned to death!!!"" They were kidding, but, only a little!!!The movie ""American Psycho"" is extremely well written, and evokes an exaggerated camaraderie with the prosperity of the eighties!! Christian Bale's acting performance in this movie is one of the best performances I have ever seen!! His perceived superiority was his convoluted form of amelioration!! Think about it this way, people can raise a family on less than $40,000.00 a year, but, they find a cuss word offensive? The same might hold true in the case of Patrick Bateman's covert vindication for his antics of absolute depravity and blatant disregard for human life!! How do these two statements correlate? They are directly related to the proverbial perception of hoof beats meaning zebras and not horses!!! I for one got caught up in the moment, and NO!! I am not seeing a shrink!!! Only because I cannot afford one, I am unemployed!!!""American Psycho"" gets five stars and a perfect ten!!! I love films that make you look in the mirror!! Without question!! Your dark side is alive and well, ultimately, you must make the volatile decision as to what extent this insidious monster prevails!!! If Americans were not afflicted by materialism and vanity, the movie industry would go bust!!!","

"nycritic","3 June 2007","There is an interesting moment during an early part of Mary Harron's controversial black horror comedy American PSYCHO that truly defines who Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is, even when hints are dropped here and there that not even Bateman himself knows who he is. As he goes through his ritual of self-pampering in the name of 'taking care of himself' much in the way cosmetic ads tells us to do, he removes an exfoliating mask from his face in a surprisingly slow way, pausing midway, as he looks at his reflection in the mirror. The camera does not flinch. What we get, for a good five to ten seconds, is the reptilian glare of a monster, a man so repulsive, so unwatchable, that he would make an excellent place as a Stephen King villain -- the Dark Man himself.However, there is nothing 'dark' about Bateman. He lives in an ultra-swanky New York apartment, all white, an ode of minimalism at its finest. He dresses himself in the finest of fabrics (the book goes to extreme detail of describing just how much of a cult of the fashion-conscious Bateman and his peers are; indeed, all of them seem to dress and look the same and are often confused for one another), he works out obsessively, he admires how he looks, and he covets. Boy, he covets! It's only implied at first, but once the mention of getting that plum reservation at Dorsia -- the Newest Place to Dine At According to the Dining Bible That is Zagat Survey -- falls on the lap of a fellow co-worker, Paul Allen (Owen in the book), Batemen goes bonkers. Literally. (And that's not even going into how he reacts when he loses in the competition of who would have the best business card.) So. Paul Allen comes to his apartment to hang out and he winds out in the wrong end of Patrick Bateman's impossibly pristine, silver axe. The scene in itself is one of the most surreal, wickedly funny, and stomach churning I've ever seen. How Mary Harron constructs it: by having Bateman doing the moonwalk over a Huey Lewis song from 1987, ""Hip to be Square"" as he recited the importance about this song in pop culture while wearing a raincoat of sorts covering the length of his suit. It's disengaging, it's completely out of whack, but it's there, and it's neatly made movie history with its balls-out temerity and I love it. More so because a woman has directed it, and women aren't always given this chance to be this dark, this perverse.American PSYCHO is visceral, though it tones it down a tad from the book -- in Bret Easton Ellis' outrageous story Patrick does even more unspeakable things to ex-girlfriend Bethany and late in the novel, to a boy and even then it's still squeamishly funny, while impossibly de Sadean. Guinevere Turner maintains the novel's essence to its core, and by also adhering to the novel's ambiguity -- since we never truly know what exactly happened, what did not, and there is the question of who Patrick Bateman really is -- she creates a wicked examination of reality versus the surreal, integrity versus collapse, the American values versus complete decadence. Oscar Wilde would probably love this story, would he be alive now: this is his own ""Picture of Dorian Grey"" taken to its furthest limits.","

"Galina_movie_fan","18 June 2004","While I believe that the book is masterfully written, I kept asking myself when I was reading it whether Ellis had a deal with the Devil - who dictated to him the confessions of the worst serial killer ever.
I do not think that there is one woman in the world who would enjoy that book; I also believe that there are not too many men either. To admire it, to respect it - yes but to enjoy it... It is a brilliant description of the 80-th - you can hear them, see them, almost touch them, they practically scream at you from the pages; and dark portrait of the 80-th golden boy who went on the rampage.
Well, there was one woman, Mary Harron, who liked and respected AP so much that she decided to transform it to the screen - and it worked. She cut down on the gore and sex and concentrated on the satire. I liked the film when I saw it first time; I love it now after the second viewing. Surprisingly restrained and funny - it has one of the best scenes I've seen in the films lately - the war of credit cards. The show belongs to Christian Bale - and he delivers as Patrick Bateman, the rich and beautiful 26 year old Wall Street banker with the secrets so dark that he makes Dr. Lector look like a Sesame Street character. Bale's cold, charismatic, misogynist turn is riveting. His James Bondian-esque face changes to the devilish mask with the reptilian eyes so rapidly, that your blood would freeze.","

"secondtake","29 July 2012","American Psycho (2000)This isn't quite a dark comedy, not a satire of psycho slasher movies, and not a straight up suspense crime flick, either. Or is it all these things?It might depend on your sense of humor. If you try to take it seriously, which you shouldn't (the first clue is in the credits when the dripping blood turns out to be a red sauce for a fancy meal), you'll end up mystified and unhappy. If you find this funny, if Christian Bale in this pre-Batman demanding role is really wry and comic for you, you'll love it. Most of the time. I was somewhere in the middle. Bale is playing a caricature--the overly rich and conceited playboy businessman in the Reagan 80s. But he plays too often the caricature directly rather than letting it come through the performance organically. Sometimes this is fine, or even great, but it puts a little strain on other scenes. (The women I know who saw it or have seen it don't think this matters so much because he's really hot, and really naked, in lots of it. And it's directed by a woman, Canadian Mary Harron who cut her teeth, not surprisingly, with the artsy ""Who Shot Andy Warhol."")The plot is important and clever, and hard to talk about because there are some key twists, the twists becoming really huge by the end. Appropriately. Because above all this is camp. It's hammy without being slapstick. It works best, in a weird example, with the recurring fascination with the business cards among this group of young pampered business jerks. Jealousies over the color of the paper and the quality of the type lead to, well, some unrestrained behavior.The movie is sometimes bloody for sure, but most of the blood is so gratuitous it isn't quite disturbing. The main character is insane as the title implies--more than you realize at first--and the people around him don't always see him for what he is. Or do they? Or do we?There are a lot of movie tricks here. Scenes shift reality, or echoes from one situation visually resemble another, and in that sense it's a smartly made. But it also manipulates too openly for anyone trying to actually enter the movie. And ""entering' the movie is a mistake. It's all show, and once you realize it's a farce and the characters don't really matter because they don't really exist (it's just a movie, the movie insists), once you realize that you're going to enjoy it more, but also realize it's a capped off experience. It only goes so far.By the end I wanted it to end. It's an odd, affected, curious, and almost period-defining movie. If you liked slightly odd creepy moves like ""American Beauty"" which has an odd echo in the title, you might want to give a go.","

"statuskuo","13 September 2022","From the writings of Brett Easton Ellis comes this tale of a Wall Street...um...mergers exec who treats people like garbage and ends up breaking down into a fantasy world of serial killing? Really? Though this movie is well directed by Mary Harron, I often wonder what this movie was even made at all. Was it a commentary on our vapid dead-emotion'd society as whole? You can't identify with someone like Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman. He is an unrepentant narcissist who often is hard to watch. Now some say art should be antagonizing, so perhaps this was its intention. What discussion could you have after watching this other than to pity humanity. The thing is, if you hate being around broker types of New Yorkers, this movie will grate on you. Some people actually do identify with Bateman and you should cut off that idea now. He is a garbage person who needs to be locked up like an animal. Perhaps that's the message.","

"zoe_14","19 November 2000","This is the worst horror film I've ever wasted my time to see. 'scream' and 'I know what you did last summer' would make a much more interesting watch than this piece of trash! Those other slasher flicks have a story line and a motive and you know not to take them seriously, but 'American Psycho' wants to be taken seriously and send across a message or something. It's stupid, boring and the story (not that there is much of one) is never fully explained. In the end I just sat there thinking well this is the biggest waste of time. It's confusing and the murder and sex scenes are just there for the heck of it - hoping that it might hold your attention. I watched this film fall further and further apart and I hoped that at the end it might all come together but I was too hopeful, obviously. It's a meaningless, for the heck of it movie and I would never even dream of recommending it to someone unless I wished them to suffer in the same way I did. I've seen my share of bad films, but I take off my hat to this one. 'American Psycho' - you take the cake of all awful.","

Having a great job at the firm of Pierce and Pierce Mergers and Acquisitions with all the perks that goes along with it, including custom made business cards, Bateman's dark side soon take over as he ends up insane In him feeling that he's not quite up to the job.That's when a co-worker Paul Allen, Jared Leto, at the firm got the coveted Fisher Account that Bateman felt was to go to him. Getting Allen good and drunk at a local Wall Street watering hole Bateman invited him up to his pad where he ended up hacking the drunk Allen to pieces and dumping his body parts wrapped in garbage bags in a number of neighbor trash dumpsters. In him, for the time being, getting away with murder has Bateman soon go over the top in in his crime spree. That in him abusing and murdering a number of hookers as well as civilians and even police to prove his new found powers in getting away with his crimes.The fact is that Bateman is not what he thinks he is and it seems that he's living in some kind of fantasy world where nothing in it is what seems to be in real life. Not a likable person in the first place Bateman gets no support from those, fellow Masters of the Univers, he associates with who are in many ways as rotten and back-stabbing as he is. The only person who tries to help him his fiancée Evelyn Williams, Reese Witherspoon, he treats like dirt, like all the women he deals with, and soon leaves him hanging. Now with no one to turn to and completely freaking out Bateman goes over the top in his fantasy world and by the end of the movie has lost his sense of importance as well as grip on reality!P.S The movie ""American Psycho"" ironically was released on ""Black Friday"" April 14, 2000 the day that the New York Stock Market or DJIA took the biggest hit, a drop of 617 points or loss of 5.66%, in its history up until then.

"ofpsmith","23 September 2019","In New York, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a wealthy, young and handsome yuppie executive who is exceedingly vapid and vain, professes socially attractive beliefs that he doesn't believe in, generally dislikes his peers, is generally disliked by his peers, is regarded as lazy and a waste by those outside his social circle, dates an equally vapid and vain woman, and cheats on her with his peers' spouses (who are, of course, as vapid and vain as they are.) Patrick belongs to a subculture of wealthy, young and handsome yuppie executives, who are exceedingly vapid and vain, profess socially attractive beliefs that they don't believe in, generally dislike their peers, are generally disliked by their peers, are regarded as lazy and as wastes by those outside their social circle, date equally vapid and vain women, and cheat on them with their peers' spouses (who are, of course, as vapid and vain as they are.) They are all the same, so much so that they call each other by the wrong name. These wasters go to New York's finest clubs and restaurants every night, dabbling in expensive clothing, food, hair product, and cocaine. They discuss music and fashion advice. They waste away the hard earned fortunes of their parents without actually doing much work themselves. Nevertheless, they are all aware of one thing; they're better than you. Patrick however, is slightly different, and markets himself in a particular way. First of all he may be aware of how superficial and ridiculous this subculture is (though this does not change his participation in it.) And secondly, he may or may not be a serial killer. Perhaps desperate to find individuality in a world lacking it or perhaps severely ill, Patrick makes himself different from those around him by killing people. Anybody. Coworkers (especially if they make him insecure), the homeless, women off the street, security guards, anyone. Sometimes the motive is clear. Other times it's completely random. The movie and novel are told from his perspective so it's completely possible that he's imaging all of this and that it's not actually happening. The movie sometimes doesn't follow its own logic but this is all part of the appeal. I've heard people claim American Psycho to be a horror film. Certainly it has those kinds of elements but I'd call it more of a dark comedy. It has a dark, satirical comic edge to it. It's not for the faint of heart but generally speaking it's one to watch.","

"Achyut_Prashast_Singh","28 July 2018","Just watched AMERICAN PSYCHO. An intense horror movie! Redefines the genre by delivering a solid plot with a scary lead actor and multiple chilling moments. A little bit of pacing issues could've been handled well but the end takes the viewer by surprise.Christian Bale is effective. I first saw him as Batman and now as Bateman...His performance is outstanding!It's hard to decide which genre it actually comes under because it blends multiple genres: horror, drama, crime, thriller etc. But I would classify it as horror because even without the chills, the lead character still is pretty menacing.The only flaw for me was there were some pacing issues due to which it felt long even at 102 minutes. But that's in a way the film's success!By the time the end arrives, the film gets elevated to a higher level. It makes me think as if really saw a masterpiece. I did, yes. I did.I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is fine with intense serial killer flicks. Infrequently but still quite graphic. Not for kids, strictly. But for grown ups, a terrific watch!","

"preppy-3","24 April 2000","For starters they took an unfilmable book, toned down all the gore (or removed it entirely) and tried to film it.  The book was bad to begin with...why try to film it?  The plot is thin and stretched out to 105 minutes and the point is made early on in the film...and then there's no where to go!  There was nothing well new or exciting in this film.  What kept it interesting was the direction and the acting.  Mary Harron is one a hell of a director--she gets inside her characters' heads and lets us know all about them visually.  The acting is superb--especially Bale.  He's playing a sociopath and a serial killer, but he makes you understand and (believe it or not) actually care for the guy!  Everybody else is great too, but Bale is just incredible.  So, good job all around, but there's no way this could ever be a good movie.  Still, it's worth seeing for the direction and acting.  Hopefully, this will bring bigger and better things for Bale.","

"davispittman","3 September 2017","American Psycho (2000) really is all about Christian Bale's descent into complete madness. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a very handsome 27 year old business man who has an extremely dark, sadistic side to him that nobody knows about. The plot revolves around Bateman and this dark side of himself, and what the horrible consequences are. One thing is for damn sure, this is not a flowery happy film, it's a dark film that isn't for everyone. It's a crime film but it also has some satire to it as well. There are other well known actors involved too. Justin Theroux, Reese Witherspoon, Jared Leto, and Josh Lucas. Lucas and Theroux play Batemans jackass colleagues. They aren't deep characters, they're just kind of the stereotypical chauvinistic privileged jerks. The other characters in the movie aren't really focused on though, this is Bale's movie, it's all about him. I will say that Bale's performance is very good, it's skillful and I don't think anyone could have played it like he did. I think this is a good film, not an excellent one. I didn't really care the satirical aspect of the movie, didn't appeal to me. The main thing I enjoyed was Bale's acting. I suggest it if it's your kind of movie, but it's not highly suggested. I wouldn't put it on a must see list, but it is a good film overall. 7/10.","

"Red-Barracuda","16 January 2017","I remember when the novel American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis was first released. It caused huge amounts of controversy on account of its scenes of extreme violence which were considered to be very misogynistic. So much so, that someone even worked out that an anagram of the author's name was 'to sell be nastier'! I ended up reading the book myself and it is true that the acts of violence get progressively more and more extreme and grim, they are disturbing for sure. But it was also equally true that this was a highly satirical work of the blackest comedy.The film version came along after quite a long genesis and naturally it got people wondering how such a book could possibly be made without being banned in almost every territory on Earth. As it turned out, the film version was a very clever interpretation of the novel which wisely understood that it could not possibly depict the violent excesses of the novel in their undiluted form but instead deftly finds ways to get around this. The ultimate result in my view is one of the few examples where the movie matches up to the novel.Set in the late 80's Manhattan the film centres on Patrick Bateman, who by day is a narcissistic Wall Street yuppie who is obsessed with success, fashion and expensive restaurants, and who by night is a serial killer. By focusing on this character the story is perfectly positioned to become a satire of 80's America and the greed and selfishness that is synonymous with certain subcultures of that era. Bale himself is emotionally sterile, he has lots of money, an expensive apartment and a beautiful fiancé but he is utterly shallow and devoid of taste. Some of the funniest scenes focus on these aspects of his character such as when he hilariously offers up his opinions on his favourite music, giving detailed, yet inane, analysis on the very mainstream 80's acts Phil Collins, Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis and the News. In another brilliant, telling scene Bateman and several of his peers compare business cards; as Bateman eyes each, practically identical, card you can sense his discomfort that his card might not be 'the best'. This scene is presented like it's a highly suspenseful revelation from a thriller and is played completely straight. That's what makes it so funny because it is negligible subjects such as the font of a business card that truly are the things of paramount importance in the world of Bateman and his cronies.It has to be said here that Christian Bale in the title role is nothing short of a revelation. It's one of my all-time favourite performances from any actor and it really showcases what a brilliant talent he is; he completely nails this character in a way that honestly feels like it could not have been improved by anyone else. Much credit also must go to director Mary Harron who has taken on a pretty challenging project in trying to adapt such a novel. There is no question in my mind that she has succeeded better than could ever have been expected. The film has to tone things down for sure but it still contains some pretty disturbing scenes nevertheless; but the focus is more squarely on the satirical elements of the story and those are explored very well indeed. In the final analysis, I would recommend both reading the book and watching the movie, as both are very high calibre examples of their type.","

They all obsess over the smallest of details on the cards which helps them do so. With the idea that this is all in Bateman's head, you can bring it back to the movie's opening: he insults the bartender and says he wants to stab her to death. Whilst saying this, it's all seen by the audience through the mirror - this is a different reflection of reality, how only Bateman sees himself.The ending kinda freaked me out though, because i hate loose ends. But not this one! Why? Because we simply cant know if it was real or not because he himself doesn't know it.","

"notoriousCASK","10 April 2020","Look at that subtle and polished script. The tasteful cinematography and direction of it. Oh my God, it even has Christian Bale's finest performance.American Psycho is a captivating study of a madman who simultaneously obsesses and criticizes the shallow culture he's a part of and attempts to hide his chaotic personal life through excessive vanity and beautification. Harron's direction is very impressive as she manages to take the story through the narrow route that blurs the line between fiction and reality with great finesse. American Psycho is a fascinating vignette of lunacy and obsession as it intriguingly blends its elements of horror and dark comedy into an exquisitely paced, masterfully directed and magnificently written story that delves into the mind and psyche of its incredibly deranged individual with plenty of success, and remains one of the finest achievements of its genre(s) and of the greatest movies of the 2000s.","

"baumer","18 April 2000","Warning, may contain some small spoilers:If anyone remembers the 80's the way I do, it goes something like this.....If you can graduate from a prestigious university in Canada or the U.S. you immediately will have a plethora of job offers thrown at you in which many of them will pay you large sums of money.  There could be some in the new computer field, it could be a brokerage firm or it could be just plain and simply, big business.It was cool, not just cool but imperative to wear the lateset fashions by Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein.  The fitness craze was launched by Olivia Newton John, Arnold Schwartzenegger and Stallone.  Words like diaretics and emphetimines were launched into our vernacular.  We blasted our pecs, did our backs and spent countless hours doing sit-ups.  BMer's and Jags and 'Vettes were the sought after cars and a man was judged by his wallet. Greed was good according to Gordon Gekko.  Life was great.  But it couldn't last and it didn't.  And now here we are recovering from ( economically speaking ) the disasterous 90's.  And we are reminded of it all again in this smart sadistic but brilliant satire of greed and lust in the 80's. Maybe the book was about a guy that just simply killed because he was psychotic, but the film is cynical look at what we all strived to be in the 80's and perhaps what we all still want to be in the new millenium.  I have never seen a film like American Psycho before and I really don't anticipate on seeing one like it again.  If you don't like this film it is maybe because you don't understand it.  Maybe that isn't fair since I hated Magnolia and those that praise it say the same thing to me, but I do feel that way in this case.Patrick Bateman is a 27 year old yuppie that has it all at some synthetic job in some synthetic building on Wall Street.  He takes pride in everything that he does.  Everything from his outer appearance to the look of his business cards.  Everything is a trophy to him and to the cronies that inhabit his world.  In one of the best scenes done in any film that I can remember, when Bateman is dragging a dead body to his car, with a train line of blood stains left behind by the body, one of his friends that he sees him on the streets says in ghastly shock as he is loading the body bag into the car, "" Oh my gosh!  Where did you get that designer bag? ""  That note, but not that note alone, but that note can be a microcosm for what the film is all about.  People see what they want to see and this time in our history was perhaps the worst for it.  The characters in this movie, while important in their own worlds, are merely just another face in the crowd that no one seems to really care about.  Paul Allen may as well be a bum in an alley, that is how much fuss is created when he disappears.  This is a world that can drive people mad just because someone elses business card has the perception of being nicer than the other guys.  It is synthetic, un-noteworthy things that drive men nuts in this film, and especially the main character in this film.Christian Bale is Patrick Bateman.  At first I couldn't understand why the actor chose to play the character the way he was, but fifteen minutes later you do understand.  This performance is one that should not be forgotten. He looks great on the outside but to paraphrase a line that he uses in the film "" I have all the traits of a normal human being, but there simply is nothing going on upstairs. """" Today I just had to kill a lot of people! ""American Psycho is a sick, twisted, hilarious and brilliant film.  It is original and it will make you think long after you have left the theater. And as a bonus too, there is no clear conclusion to the film.  You can interpret it two ways.  Both ways make sense to me and maybe they are both right.  I really don't care what the book was trying to do or say, this film has it's own way of saying it.  I cannot recommend this film enough.  If anything, it will challenge your thinking, and that is always a positive thing in a film.  But other than that, it is a damn fine film and one of the best films so far in this young millenium!9 out of 10","

5. The score does a fantastic job at adding to the comedy moments, whilst also cementing the gritty scenes.
6. The violence is brutal, impactful, and highly memorable - especially the scene involving Paul Allen, or the naked chainsaw run.
7. Patrick Bateman's slow descent into madness is both captivating, and mostly well-done.

"dglink","26 September 2005","In a world where appearances are everything and a man's status is determined by the typography, watermark, and paper quality of his business cards, lurks an empty shell of man, who is either falling deeper into madness or satisfying his intense blood lust through a series of brutal murders. Such is the ambiguity of this fascinating film that it easily stands up to repeated viewing if only to explore what is real and what is illusion. Patrick Bateman, who is a distant relative of Norman Bates in more than name, is a loner surrounded by people with whom he never relates. Although he does not hide from the world like Norman did, Patrick's icy facade, which has been conditioned and pomaded into a mask of normality, shields him from the world as effectively as the remote motel hid Norman. With his mask in place, Patrick Bateman intermingles in a world of interchangeable people, who vie with each other for social position through table reservations at trendy restaurants, the quality of a hair cut, or the fabric of a custom-tailored suit. Money flows from toil-less occupations in a New York milieu, where, as Gordon Gecko in ""Wall Street"" so aptly summed up, ""greed is good."" The Reagan era on steroids, although Bateman's peers comment negatively on the president as they watch him try to explain away the Iran-Contra scandal during a televised speech. The young men's remarks about lying are ironic, when their own lives of sham and deceit are considered.But, under the glistening surfaces, like the depths explored by David Lynch in ""Blue Velvet,"" the being who is known as Patrick Bateman lives another life, possibly in his deteriorating mind or possibly in dark back alleys and designer apartments or possibly in both simultaneously. Simply put, Patrick does not like women, and he does not like rivals, and he is eager to dispense with both through his adept use of gleaming stainless-steel axes or state-of-the-art nail shooters. While Norman Bates had deep-seated problems with sex and evidently did not have physical relations with women, Patrick does have sex with women, who are often paid. Patrick's women become debased objects that he abuses, while he admires his own physique in the mirror. Even in the most intimate act of sex, Patrick does not relate with anyone other than himself. However, unlike Norman Bates, Patrick Bateman does not have a mother complex, in fact, he does not seem to have a mother or any family at all. He is a being with no past, no relationships, and no soul. The role is difficult, and Christian Bale as Bateman is outstanding. The perfection of his looks and physique make him physically ideal for the part. But his performance is more than surface sheen, and Bale disarms the viewer as he slowly escalates from a cool emotionless young professional into a psychotic as the character descends further into his own perverted delusions or manic blood lust. Bale's is a performance as ambiguous as the film.The direction by Mary Harron is excellent as well. Harron wisely focuses on the satire inherent in the screenplay and downplays the violence, which is more often suggested than illustrated. Apparently, she has studied Hitchcock and knows that what the audience imagines can be far more powerful than what they actually see. ""American Psycho"" is a stimulating work that can provide fuel for heated discussion about what actually does or does not occur. Does the violence exist only in the pornographically violent doodles in Patrick's office agenda or did an unseen protector clean up the evidence of his series of murders? Or both? Like Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" the film swirls downward like dark water into a drain as Bateman is sucked further into madness, which eventually consumes his entire world and draws the viewer in with him.","

"Stampsfightclub","23 August 2009","Patrick Bateman (Bale) lives and works on Wall Street, projecting an image of perfection in his busy schedule, but at night, he descends into his own experiments and fantasises.Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman in this Mary Hannon picture and with his sophisticated approach to the needy and greedy protagonist, do we viewers dive into a world where social class is everything to be successful.As the film gets under way we see the central character describe himself as an intelligent being, a man who knows what and who he likes and aims to keep it that way. Starting at a posh restaurant with his colleagues discussing the local works trends and social gossip do we get a picture of what working on Wall Street is like.American Psycho is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel, and the author has clearly a colourful picture on the minds of the highly prestigious workmen in America. This screenplay is marvellous, owing to the fact that Bale's character is so well thought out; a protagonist to envy and to identify with. His work is tame; his colleagues are infuriating whilst his fiancée annoys the living daylights out of him. But he continues down the same path owing to the fact he must project an important image; an image of power and success. The attitude of Bateman is quite remarkable. His self loving success driven mindset is staggering, and the Dark Knight actor is frankly remarkable in this role Many films of course look at social class workings or stereotypes. From the significant upbringing and destiny surrounding Eddie Murphy in Trading Places to the way strangers and criminals look at Sidney Poitier's cop in In the Heat of the Night but with this 2000 release, you get a significant feeling that the way you walk and talk generally affects you persona and your presentation to others, which arguably decides the fate of this film.Bateman's constant conformity to the general high standards of Wall Street leave him wanting more and when he is at home watching porn, experimenting with face products or doing his exercise regimes, he descends into a world of madness, and this is where the film drives into exciting mystery.After Paul Allen shows him a business card and forgets his name once too often, Bateman introduces him to his axe, and after this arguably frightening sequence, the character base is set and the expectancy to see Bateman's next move is anticipation of the highest degree.Honestly even as the caped crusader Bale has never been more impressive. His depiction of this character is completely accurate and interesting. He derives from a standard of madness and makes it fascinating psychologically whilst oddly, surprisingly comic at various points. The character is a joy; a privilege to watch and observe and the madness may give Hamlet a run for his money. A must watch for the sheer brilliance of the character development and Bale's performance.","

"FLASHP01NT","3 October 2020","There are two main interpretations of the film:1. That Bateman is actually a psychological construct of Davis; The main character of the film is Davis. We are in the mind of Davis as he dreams about being Bateman.2. That Bateman is actually Bateman, and he does really kill people, but it's impossible for the police to pin the murders on him because nobody in corporate america knows each other, causing false negatives that interrupt the continuity of the criminal investigation.If you believe #1: The movie is a psychological reactionism to the monotony and inhumanity of corporate life; fantasizing about murder functions as an escape mechanism and helps Davis maintain his sanity.If you believe #2: Bateman is a sociopathic serial killer who is successful in business because of his negative pathologies. Bateman feels nothing and thought that murdering people would help him to feel something, but it didn't. In the end Bateman wants to be caught and punished; because then he would be put out of his misery. However Bateman can't be caught due to the nature of his employment, which makes him both invisible and void of responsibility. Bateman is now cursed to continue his miserable existence, which, to him, is the same as being in prison.A third interpretation exists which is similar to the second: In this case, Bateman, again, really does kill people; but everyone around him helps him to conceal the crimes out of self-interest. So, at the end of the film, the real estate agent actually cleaned up the apartment and got rid of the bodies; and Bateman's lawyer knows he killed Paul Allen, but intentionally lied to the police about having lunch with Allen in London in order to protect Bateman, who is a VP of P&P (previously said to be a company for which Bateman's father ""practically owns"").","

"garethcrook","31 May 2020","If I'm honest, I'm only here for Huey Lewis. Just kidding... although I do love Huey Lewis. I do love this film too though. It's a rare occasion where I like the film as much as it's source, maybe even more than. Easton Ellis' book is a masterpiece, even more gruesome than what's committed to screen here, but what it doesn't have is Christian Bale. He's on fire here, my favourite performance (he's also great in The Machinist and Le Mans 66). Here though, as Patrick Bateman, the meticulous psychopathic yuppie, he's magnificent. Bateman is cinematic gold, good looking, successful, intelligent and articulate. He's also a stone cold, calculating killer. For an 80s yuppie, that most loathsome of sets, he's oddly captivating, every bit the anti-hero. Narrating as he goes, Bale's voice sounding unnervingly like Easton Ellis... or maybe Easton Ellis sounds like Bale?... or Bateman! Anyway, perhaps it's the world in which he operates and it's depiction that makes this work so well. Hyper-stylised restaurants with pretentious names, minimal apartment layouts, the obsessing over business cards and Bateman's desire to fit in, but his competitiveness not allowing him to do so. This all provides a sleek clean surface for Bateman to cover in blood with devastating effect. He's annoyingly likeable... until he kills a homeless man and his dog. However on the flip side, minutes later, it's Huey time! Gleaming Axe, transparent raincoat and the idiot Jared Leto lured back to Bateman's apartment. Paul Allen (Leto) you see has upset Bateman. He has a better haircut, can get reservations at in vogue restaurant Dorsia, even has a better business card and mistakes him for someone else, as do several others. He's in trouble and it's not long until he's hacked to pieces as 'Hip to be Square' blasts out. This though might be his undoing as private detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe) is drafted in to find Allen and harass Bateman. He knows something's up, that unmistakable smile meeting Bateman's pouting frown, but their exchanges are more awkward than anything else. It's an odd film, no one is likeable to any degree, sexist Wall Street morons, drugged up socialites. Everyone is vile. There's very little thread to it either, aside Bateman's insecurities. Even the persistent detective feels like a nuisance sub plot to the killing spree. Ultimately it's Bateman's slip into more and more extreme and sadistic behaviour that drives this, with the sight of him running naked and blood splattered through the hallway with a chainsaw and him sweating profusely in designer suits as the minutes pass by being the more notable events. Bateman knows he's coming apart, but his lack of emotions confuse him. As he slides further it's difficult to get a grip if events are real or part of his deepening psychosis. It's chilling in it's pointlessness, but fantastic and makes me want to pick up the book again, but first... I have to return some videotapes.","

And how cringing the dire performance by Christian Bale was.He seemed to have adopted a Jim Carrey persona. While Jim is funny. Bale is not. The mannerisms, the voice, everything sucks about Bale.And the story? What story. There is none. It's just a collection of disjointed scenes, mixed with violence and murder - to quote Shakespeare - 'signifying nothing.'Also, Bale is only 26 in this movie. At times he looks mid 40s.It's a pile of trash I would not recommend to my worst enemy. One of the most overrated films of all time.Just 1/10 and I am being generous.","

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","26 December 2006","Patrick Bateman has everything: money, good looks, health, nice apartment, and an easy going high paying job. Beneath this business school success story, however, lies a dark man who knows and even acknowledges that he has everything, but wants more...Since this is an adaptation you can see this movie as too different things: as an adaptation of the novel, or as just a movie if you haven't read the novel. As a movie it is well done, especially with Bale's frightening performance as the callous Bateman, and it is that with the general ambition that went into the project that overshadows the film's obvious limitations. And there are quite a few of them. I have never read the book, but have heard about it enough to see that the film is aesthetically way below the scope of the novel. The locations and sets simply just barely manage to cut it. However the film is a success due its tone.The themes, metaphors, and idea of the book presented in such a way that you get the feeling that yes, the filmmakers know the source material, like the source material and put in an honest effort to get it translated to the screen. After all, it is the themes and ideas that matter more than the actual physical look of the film. ""Apocalypse Now"" looks nothing like Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" - different time period, different locations, etc... - but the fundamental themes of the novel (the stuff that matters most) are there and it is a great movie based off of a great book. With ""American Psycho"" fans can delight in the adaptation as also being faithful in the aesthetic sense.However, fans should also be ready to forgive. Think about it, would any major studio release a movie with a seriously f***ed up lead character like Bateman? Author Bret Easton Ellis was himself shot down by publishers before he got his book out, so this isn't mainstream thought and metaphor here. It is un-PC, hard to swallow, but daring in it's ambitions and that is what makes the film good. --- 8/10Rated R for strong violent content and sex","

"radhrh","1 April 2022","I read the book when it was first published I think in the early 90s and was frankly horrified by it being as it is a catalogue of truly awful acts so brutal I can't mention them here for fear of getting banned from IMDB. Seriously, it really is that bad. When I heard they were going to make a film based on the book I was very surprised, how could they possibly film this? Cleverly the film makers emphasize the satirical elements, which although present in the book didn't register with me at the time of reading so traumatized was I by the violence. As the story of Patrick Bateman is a satire on late 1980s Wall Street the film does a better job of telling that story than the book on which it is based. Quite some achievement.","

"Backlash007","29 December 2008","~Spoiler~American Psycho is best described by its title. Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a man with wealth, looks, and charm...a vision of the American dream. Or is he the American nightmare? You see, he just can't get that reservation at Dorsia. Also, his business card isn't as impressive because he didn't go with the eggshell white. This is a film that I initially found a bit disturbing and did not care for at all. Upon revisiting it, however, American Psycho has hit an unexpected place: my funny bone. This is one of the most quotable movies ever and I can't believe how funny it is. I guess the first time I watched I didn't get it for what it was: a satire. It's a satirical look at the materialism and excess of the 80's and I had not seen Oliver Stone's Wall Street before viewing American Psycho. Wall Street was the key to unlocking this movie for me. Sounds weird, doesn't it? But I swear that's what did it for me. Well, that and my love for Huey Lewis and the News. The film is packed with a star-studded cast, but it's Bale who makes a name for himself here. He is the whole show. If you are a fan of his, I suggest seeing this film as you will see a much different side of the actor. Or, if you thought Genesis was too artsy before the presence of Phil Collins became more apparent, then American Psycho is for you too. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to return some videotapes.","

Patrick Bateman is a perfect example of how someone can seem so normal but be so unstable. Showing that even the big Wall Street tycoon Can be Murderer and cannibal at the same time. As some of the most memorable lines that a psychopath could ever utter. The film also captures the feel of the 80s better then most modern movies From the suits to the business talk to the music it feel like a 80s movie.

But I actually think that the secret to that film was that the only way to understand it was to reject its abysmal navel-gazing and walk out of it. Which I did. And if you sat and watched to the end, you didn't get it. So in that bit of turnabout, that film earned its ticket price. This had no redeeming value that I could see. The one positive thing I can say about this is that I find Christian Bale's weird, stiff inability to act grating in pretty much every film I have seen him in, so maybe if they had hired someone else, this movie wouldn't have sucked such gangrenous boils. But I just don't get what's interesting about this film that these other people see. Smug finance exec is going crazy, feels entitled, acts like a dick, has murderous fantasies, thinks he's funny but isn't. And?

"Avv79","26 June 2022","Only great filmmakers can include a scene in which the protagonist precisely explains his daily skincare routine without it being boring but actually a very creative way to describe a character's quirks. It's a psycho so invested in himself and so perfect that people never pick up on the not so nice things he says and does. And the setting to place it in - a office environment where we actually never see anyone do any work at all throughout the film apart from Bateman's assistent and live the American dream.And this man apparently has the audacity to tell a homeless person to get a job and accuse him of having a negative attitude. I do like the originality of the scene because Bateman doesn't instantly frown with disgust but rather amused by the way someone could end up so worthless. And I can't stop laughing either when he delivers the lines: ''You reek of s**t. Do you know that"" in the way that he does.I enjoy the fact that it doesn't feel we are waiting for him to kill another person but, it just feels like we are following a person living the corporate life and just happens to kill people from time to time like a real psychopath.And the way he goes about killing people or goes about his business in truly psychotic and at the same time utterly hilarious. In short: this man enjoys killing people while he passionately describes his feelings about an album or artist/band.Lastly, it's genius to end the movie with Bateman's confession for the murders but still having no one to care for it because everybody in his environment cares more about themselves than others. He might be like everybody else in the room with repressed rage, meaning everybody could become or already be an American Psycho.","

"zetes","6 December 2009","For most of this film's run, I was in agreement with those who have named this one of the films of the decade. It's just exuberant, hilarious, gripping and spot-on. I'm very vocal in my dislike of Christian Bale's acting style - it feels way too old fashioned to me (if he had been acting in the '50s and '60s, he'd definitely be among the best actors of his time, but nowadays, it just comes off as ridiculously methody), but American Psycho is pitched as a cartoon, and he fits in well. Most of the set-pieces are tremendous, most notably his axe murder set to Huey Lewis' ""Hip to Be Square"". I love every time he goes into the super-long descriptions of the music and artists he's listening to. The problem is, after the climactic sequence, the film takes the kind of twist that was all too prominent between the late '90s and today. Suffice it to say, it's not much more interesting than, ""It was all just a dream"". It flops to the floor like a dead fish and then ends. Definitely disappointing in that way, but I can totally dig the bulk of the movie.","

Patrick is carrying a bag of a body with blood spilling all over and putting it in the back of a car, and people ask where the bag is from. The main character is unintelligent and not charismatic enough. Rather, a detective is more charismatic and outsmarts the villain so easily with large margin. I am not sure how a real-life psychopath's brain works, but each killing in the MOVIE should mean or represent something. Maybe Harron is trying to emphasize how much random Patrick's killing is and how much joy he gets from it. However, as an audience, I feel too uncomfortable of Harron's listing of killing methods. Very much overrated and very weak ending.","

"lee_eisenberg","16 June 2005","""Wall Street"" showed America's billionaires as worthless human beings, but ""American Psycho"" goes one step further: it tells of a Gordon Gekko-type who is actually a murderer. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is quite possibly the most despicable kind of person imaginable. For starters, he's as vain as can be: only twenty-seven years old, he is already using excluding mask. He has gotten a job in his daddy's firm and spends all day listening to CDs while his secretary does his work for him. Whenever he and his equally despicable buddies (or is that ""cronies""?) get together, they brag about their business cards. When Patrick sees that his friend Paul has a ""better"" business card, that's the end of Paul. It ends up that Patrick just kills almost anyone.""American Psycho"" is really a slam on the whole stock broker culture. But it seems that such people deserve to get slammed.","

"Billiam-4","20 February 2000","AMERICAN PSYCHO is Mary Harron's second feature film after her acclaimed I SHOT ANDY WARHOL(and an episode for the TV series Homicide). Her movie has been long in the making, frequently having been discussed, because the studio obviously wanted Leonardo Di Caprio for the leading role of the young big business executive who is - for a pastime- also a serial killer. Harron was opposed to this casting decision and she managed to get Christian Bale whose greatest role till now might have been as Little Jim in Spielberg's EMPIRE OF THE SUN. I read Bret Easton Ellis's infamous novel and must admit I was quite bored. It is an endless succession of what Mr. Bateman wears, uses for his hygiene, what he eats and what he thinks about everything in general, all in a disgusting yuppie pseudo-smartass tone. His very drastically described massacres hardly contribute to making the book more accessible. Mary Harron, however, accomplished the amazing: a movie which is much better than the book! Here she has found a style to envision Bateman's vanity, delicately focusing on the empty icons of this strange society of yuppie executives and staging it slightly as satire with many occasions for the audience to get a laugh. This is something which Ellis is completely incapable of, but probably had intended. The best scenes are where the guys compare their business cards and everyone is envious of the other's, although they all look more or less the same. Bateman eventually kills one of his colleagues for just the reason that his card looks more exclusive. Bateman's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde personality slowly intermingles so that, at the end, he cannot  distinguish between the two sides of his existence anymore. Although his hideous crimes, artfully staged by Harron between horror and hilarity, can't be overseen anymore, the people around him are so vain that they don't even notice what's happening. As Bateman realizes at the end: ""My confession means nothing at all"", so has the film managed to show us that his existence is just the same. In a small role as Bateman's secretary, Chloe Sevigny is well cast, as always a bit sleepy and slow, but just perfect in this movie. One detail I really liked especially: I always knew that Nouvelle Cuisine was nothing but disgusting and an insult to true cuisine culture. I'll give 10/10","

"christopher-underwood","17 August 2017","Loved the book, which I remember recommending to many but I recall being disappointed with the film. Now with memory of both rather faded, another look. It is a hard film to 'like' as the events and characters all seem to be horrible. And I mean the obsession with getting reservations for crazy restaurants serving crazy foods covered with scribbled sauces. The obsession for clothes and even personal cards and the variations of colour and embossing. All this is terrible enough never mind the grim killings and the increasingly confusing happenings as we begin to doubt what is being presented to us. Is Bale being evasive or is there something else going on, or not going on, more to the point? On balance and with the benefit of distance from those mad Wall Street days, this takes on the air of a decent satire of the times, when human life itself seemed less important than some statement suit or signature dish. And then the are the drugs. In truth its a wonder with all the money sloshing around and all the drugs being consumed that more people didn't get really, really confused as to what was real and what wasn't. Great looking film and even the really bad 80s music fits in to help this insanity keep rolling till the end.","

"XxEthanHuntxX","18 August 2020","A masterful adaptation of words to cinema by Mary Harron, this is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's 1991 novel that was set in the 1980s. Though at the time it was called sexist filth by some. Christian Bale's performance is brutally riveting, playing a man disconnected from reality, thats established subtly from the start through Bateman's skewed priorities, like valentino suits, thick business cards and dinner reservations. Defined by consumerism living in the language of ads and driven forward by consumption. And his point of view does not define objective reality, this is represented by his inflated ego, his psychosis and many other mental illnesses - presumably his narcissistic and borderline behaviour. The film is basically a black comedy, and a critique of male behaviour.There is many scenes that points towards that - it was all in Bateman's head. But in fact its meant to be ambiguous and the film isn't about that question, and not about murder either for that matter. American Psycho is about yuppie culture, the melding of identity and the craving to stand out from such a superficial homogenized society.Patrick Bateman tries like the rest to fit in, but lives a double life as a killer, but he's not the killer he think's he is. As he goes insane he cant distinguish fantasy from reality. His over the top chainsaw killings, may be an aestheticised elaboration on partial truths. Ultimately the film doesn't care, the bigger point of the movie's absurdity is that within his society Bateman is not the psycho at all, he's just one more normal guy amidst a horde of uncaring detached from reality secretly discontented American psychos.","

"MxS7HGS","24 November 2023","Bret Easton Ellis's ""American Psycho"" is a book and movie that received mixed reviews. While some people adored it, others despised it. When the novel was released, many believed that the author would never make it big again. Nevertheless, I think it's a masterpiece that exhibits Ellis's full range of storytelling skills. Although Patrick Bateman, the protagonist, is unaware, the author is not. The book is a form of satire, but many individuals don't comprehend it and only concentrate on its violent and pornographic elements.Mary Harron's movie adaptation is remarkable. Given the difficulty of the story, the film is a very faithful portrayal of the book. Christian Bale's portrayal of Patrick Bateman is iconic and unforgettable. The movie's most significant aspect is its satirical nature. It's a parody of itself, and it's hilarious.If you're a fan of ""American Psycho,"" I suggest reading ""Exquisite Corpse"" by Poppy Z. Brite, another horror book that is also quite extreme by a talented author.One of the novel's most extended chapters is about Whitney Houston and Bateman's admiration for her as a singer. However, Houston refused to allow any of her songs to be used in the film.","

"cadman_9999","23 September 2000","NOTE: This comment involves spoilers.I rented this movie last night thinking it would be a gripping, psychological tale of cat-and-mouse between Christian Bale's serial killer and Willem DaFoe's detective.  I have no idea how I got so confused, to think this film would offer up a plot of that level of quality, but I must have somehow connected it with ""Silence of the Lambs"" on some subconscious level.  What I wound up watching was a pointless and stupid compilation of cliches without any satisfying denouement to the story, that needlessly drained 100 minutes from my life on earth.This is one of those films people either love or hate, I've observed.  I'm proud to put myself in the latter category.  Fans of ""American Psycho"" have raved about it's biting depiction of Manhattan in the 1980's.  Perhaps that was what started me off on the wrong foot, for that decade is one that is best left forgotten.  As it turned out, so is the plot of this movie.""American Psycho"" is, hands-down, one of the worst movies I've seen in my life, alongside of ""Sleepaway Camp"" and ""Apt Pupil.""  I don't have an objection to violent films overall; I am certainly not one of those anti-Hollywood types lecturing about movie content today, but the events that occurred in this tale were just brutal and disturbing, and had no message attached, other than showing us what some crazy jerk is capable of. I grew up watching flicks like ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween,"" but now that I'm older perhaps I just don't see the point of gratuitous, shocking mayhem such as what's in this film.  There's nothing positive about the movie, but there is much that's negative and depressing, such that it made ""Seven"" look like ""Mary Poppins"" in terms of cheerfulness.The central character, Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) is the embodiment of the movie's title.  He provides us with a string of glimpses into his life and mental state that constitute nothing more than ""See Patrick shower.  See Patrick go to the office.  See Patrick socialize with his rich Wall Street buddies.  See Patrick cheat on his fiancee.  See Patrick kill for no reason.""  While he does narrate some of his perspective on life to the viewer, it's tired and predictable, and reminiscent of the Thomas Harris' novel ""Red Dragon.""  There is never any background on Bateman; no details of his family or childhood, but that's just as well for it would probably consist of even more stereotypes.  All you need to know about Bateman is that he is pure scum who hurts others any way he can (whether by killing, cheating, or just plain arrogant condescension) for enjoyment.I have to give Bale credit for a powerful portrayal of his character, but that's exactly the problem with watching Bateman in action.  He is too much to take; his annoying, smarmy tone of voice, facial expressions and snotnosed attitude are all guaranteed to provoke heavy loathing in the viewer long before he even starts slaughtering his fellow New Yorkers.  And not a ""good"" loathing in the sense you're gripped by the story, but rather an overall disgust for having to even view such a person or listen to him speak.  If you knew someone who acted like Bateman you would hasten to remove yourself from his presence; you certainly wouldn't give him 100 minutes of your time.  It's no different seeing him on the screen. Watching the life of such an absolutely reprehensible person as this leaves you feeling like you bathed in a sewer.  Bateman's high-rolling friends and associates are almost as universally unredeeming, the only distinction between they and Bateman is that they don't kill people.  The only characters towards which one might feel empathy are either killed off by Bateman or too clueless to get in his way.A truly heart-wrenching scene early on involving a homeless man and his dog sets the nauseating pace for the rest of the movie, which I proceeded to watch only in the grim hope of seeing swift, harsh justice delivered to Bateman; i.e. in the form of the usual desperate police shootout in the final frames.  Sadly, even that common element of the ""serial killer flick"" was left out in favor of a myriad of obfuscating ""let's leave the viewer in the dark"" details.  I'm aware that some of the compliments directed towards this film are based on the very ambiguity of the ending, or the view of Bateman's [further] descent into madness.  While these seem paramount to some, to me it was just lame and uninteresting.  DaFoe's detective, who shows such promise early on, really serves as nothing more than a red herring in this film.Some fans have commented on the elements of this movie which they feel cause a person to think.  I ""get"" everything about ""American Psycho"" - that is to say, nothing ""went over my head,"" so someone more enthusiastic about the film than I should not think I just wasn't paying attention.  I just didn't think it mattered, or was compelling.  When the final scene rolled past the only reaction I felt was relief, that I was done watching this miserable movie.  I got up this morning and took it back to Blockbuster with the express intention of getting it out of my house and off my hands.Readers of this review will probably wonder why I invested several paragraphs in commenting on ""American Psycho"" if I despised it so much. The answer is simple: catharsis.  Save your bucks and rent ""Wild, Wild West instead"" - it's ""The Godfather"" by comparison.","

"MovieMike1995","4 February 2022","American Psycho is a movie that I've had a strange history with.The first time I saw it, I saw it as a slightly silly but overall thoroughly entertaining thriller with a phenomenal performance from Bale of course.The second time I watched it, it suddenly clicked with me. This whole film is a satire of the 80s yuppie life and is not meant to be taken seriously. This movie has a really great sense of humour from the obsession with image to Bale's over the top portrayal of our anti-hero Patrick Bateman.To put it simply, this movie asks the question: what if a serial killer masqueraded as a Wall Street whiz kid and struggled to keep his murderous tendencies under wraps?I honestly think the bigger question should be: Is he trying to keep his killer instincts a secret or does he secretly want to be found out in order stand out above his peers?The ending certainly suggests the latter when Bateman is confessing everything he has done to his lawyer only to find out that maybe he did none of it. Did any of it really happen? Was it all in his head?This is an ending that has been debated for years. Me personally, I think it's too much of a cop out to say that was all in his head as it's too much of an easy explanation. I truly believe that it all really happened, however, Bateman didn't take into account that he's not the only psychopath in this city.In the world of the yuppie in the 80s, people get mistaken for other people as established earlier in the film as Jared Leto's character keeps mistaking Bateman for someone else. This is a world where estate agents will happily dispose of dead bodies that they find in order to keep property values high as Bateman discovers when he goes to check on 2 dead bodies towards the end of the film.In other words, Bateman desperately wanted to stand out in a world where he blends in more than he thinks. As he says at the end:'This confession has meant nothing'","

"xxxxxdarkmoon","25 May 2023","Today I was watching American Psycho for the 2nd time, and surprise: I didn't like it anymore, not at all. Although it is a great movie, and I will tell you, why is that. Christian Bale is doing a great job, he plays the role of an extremely ego-focused person who has zero empathy, who has not even a glimpse of compassion and no conscience at all. A guy who loves himself and nobody else. He hasn't that ability. He has zero tolerance and he gets frustrated in no time. In other words: an extremely poor personality. He is the extract of a narcissist. A psychopath. The bad message is, that a lot of such psychopaths are living amongst us - in disguise. Believe it or not, this is a fact.Today when I was watching it for the 2nd time, I had to skip parts from the beginning, because I couldn't stand watching that daily routine of that narcissistic prick. His shower routine, his diet plan and whatnot. But then it turned out, I couldn't stand watching ANY parts of the movie. The question is: is that a good thing or a bad thing? I mean, why would I enjoy watching the life and murders of the ultimate prick? He kills a homeless man because the homeless man failed in life and stinks. How could I enjoy watching this person? I refuse to call that person a human being. I guess, that makes this movie a great movie.","

"noahgibbobaker","10 September 2020","To me, american psycho is not about murder, it is about the superficial culture of wall street in the 1980's. I think this message is still relevant today as wall street is still as materialistic and superficial as ever.I think Bateman's identity is purposefully left ambiguous as everyone on wall street just blends together, they all want the same thing, to be a stereotypical successful man. This lack of individuality is something Bateman doesn't want to be a part of, he wants to be seen as a killer, he wants to be seen as anything other than everyone else. Patrick hates the void of personality on wall street on some level but ultimately still indulges in it. He uses women only for pleasure and nothing else, he always tells people about his material belongings, sometimes complete strangers and is just like the people who surround him.I believe that scenes when Bateman murder are hallucinations, he uses a chainsaw that nobody seems to hear and then drops it onto someone from the top to a staircase to kill them. He also uses a gun with perfect accuracy without any training and makes two police cars explode with it. I believe that Bateman is actually Davis. Bateman is Davis' desperate attempt to separate himself from yuppie culture, but by doing this he, eventually, is unable to determine fantasy from reality.Even though I think Patrick Bateman is a hilusination I still think american psycho is a great character study of him. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is extremely realistically and respectfully depicted along with narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. I love the way this film puts you in the head of such a confused and dangerous person. I think that too many filmmakers more recently are scared of doing something that questions the viewers' morales and makes them actually think about what they are seeing.Most of problems lie with the technical elements. I thought the cinematography was good but nothing to write home, in fact I thought most of the technical elements were not very special. Some of my issue could be down to this film being made in 2000, for example the greenscreen, when used, wasn't great.American psycho is one of the best films of the 2000's. Go see it.","

"ansharora-12638","16 June 2020","American Psycho elucidates that having strong and vibrant feelings towards things doesn't necessarily mean you are a ""Psycho"". Yes you are deeply flawed but so is every other human being on this godforsaken earth.Patrick Bateman's character is almost too fun but too shallow at times. The way he was disappointed when Bryce favoured other card and how he was finally broken by Luis' business card. The way he let Reese Witherspoon let off because they were together for a long time.The only thing the story doesn't give light enough is on the topic whether Bateman really killed others or not. The doorman, the prostitutes and that old lady outside the ATM machine. But, more than that I want to know whether he really killed that poor dog with the homeless man or was it just another of his ""drawings"".In all, a tightly packed movie with some high points but other than that, it can be a good study but I think Dexter took the concept and made it to so much more. That is also based on book(s) and it was also based on a novel but I don't know how much it is accurate (I have not read the novel) but I am pretty sure the ending must be kind of different in the novel. Who's to say.I give it 8.7/10","

At the same time it depens and enriches the meanings of his previous works. I also think, he works best within the confines of the group than as a solo artist, and I stress the word artist!","

"zmaturin","3 May 2000","[This review has a few minor spoilers]I'll admit it: I'm a sucker for any movie with chainsaw. Be it Ash or Leatherface, give the lead a buzz saw to chase down their adversaries, and I'm happy. That's why it was so great to see Patrick Bateman, this movie's titular psycho, running down a hallway, naked, chasing a screaming woman and clutching a roaring chainsaw.Patrick also watches ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" while working out, executes people while discussing the finer points of Phil Collins, and will kill anyone with a nicer business card than his. In short, he's the best horror character in years, which is why it's sad that this movie shies away from true horror, because I thought it was near perfect.Well, that's not true- I didn't like the ending (although it leaves the door open for a sequel, which I would be in favor of) and some parts are a little slow, but overall this movie is an excellent look at what it's like to loose one's mind. The whole 1980s setting attempts to make this movie into a parody of the greedy ""me""-decade, but what really shined through for me is Bateman's ever-growing fear and hatred of people, a feeling I'm sure more than one viewer will associate with, which will make it all the more disturbing when Bateman turns murderer.Christian Bale is beyond perfect as the homicidal maniac who fits in with his upper crust friends and coworkers so well that he becomes invisible. The supporting cast is adequate, but all seem subdued and ""turned down"" compared to Bale's tour-de-force performance.","

Generally I hate blood and 'gore', but somehow this was made to be 'fantastical', so that it wasn't even real to the person who perpetrated it...

"harrylosborne","8 April 2019","American Psycho is a genre-defining piece, if only for its quotability and warped outlook on the modern USA. Patrick Bateman (played by Christian Bale) is the ultimate pseudo-horror character: precise, meticulous and superficially perfect. However, below this exterior, Bateman shows a twisted mind obsessed with murder and torture, a profile he struggles to hide throughout his everyday life. As the film progresses, the mannerisms of Bateman begin to make more and more sense - always calculated and disguised, but verging on being discovered for who he truly is.Bateman's interactions with his closest ""friends"" are the most fascinating to watch, as he pretends to buy into the high life of Manhattan purely to maintain his social image. Talking to his fiancee Evelyn (Reece Witherspoon) seems like an actual chore to Bateman, from which his only real reprieve is 80s music. Ultimately, you don't watch the film for the violence and the brief scenes of madness, but for the tightrope Bateman walks in living an everyday, affluent life.Overall, American Psycho is a cultish classic, but still offers a brilliant story of insanity through an antagonist's eyes, whilst being instantly memorable.","

"Dr_Coulardeau","18 December 2020","Watch that film a second or a third time and enjoy the impossible meaning of it. The character is brilliant, cruel, inhuman, vicious, and perverse. He is a metaphor for the financial world of today: those who have the power of money can do all they want, including killing anyone who has the only shortcoming of being there at hand when they shouldn't have been. Jealousy is the basic feeling and envy is the basic passion.At the same time, this character and the film are a metaphor for the illusion this financial world is. The illusion that the world is their property, though it is not. They are ranting and raving about it but the world goes on revolving on its axis and evolving into its own future that has nothing to do with what these finance people want or would like it to be. The world has its own history, and no one has the power to kill all those who do not fit, to reject them forever, and to negate thousands of years of multifarious human struggle for collective freedom and progress.This character, though he may have killed no one, is a criminal nevertheless because his mind is bent onto killing all those who do not accept his absolute domination. This character is a tyrant, a dictator, a perverted serial killer of the mind, and though he may not be using Weapons of Mass Destruction or even simple pistols and knives, he is using another Weapon of Mass Perversion: finance. With the power of finance, one can kill millions by starving them to death or locking them out of human progress, at least the human progress that money can bring which is a soulless material luxury and nothing else.The film brings us a question that we cannot answer: what can stop these financial killers and keep them under restraint and control? The film does not want to answer this question, and the book behind did not try to do it either. History will answer the question within a couple of decades if we are lucky or more if we do not have any luck at all, but history will eventually and relentlessly answer the question and bring these financial feudal barons under the law of human progress. I do not think the character is psychotic.In fact, he is completely schizophrenic and he cannot survive in this world if he is not. That is also a lesson that comes out of these images: one needs a personal life to survive and that personal life must not in any way be invaded by the financial circus. There is only one way out of this dilemma: to escape to the farthest and deepest desert in the world, which would mean suicide, or to join a human society in which money does not exist, which would mean going back to even before the Stone Age. Careful, you may have some nightmares after watching this film.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU","

"akdjreview","23 November 2021","A movie I went in with high expectations thanks to some friends and social media. But to be honest, I was not disappointed. The film was relatively short, which I like, and you could feel that they did not try to drag the storyline and the film.The main character Patrick Bateman was incredibly well thought out. An interesting character, however, I do not understand how so many can compare themselves with him when he is utterly insane. The film was grotesque in a fitting way and Bateman had an interesting character development where you became more and more familiar with him. The end is the only thing I would say was confusing. I did not understand whether he had just imagined everything. The film is from the year 2000 so, you can understand that the scenes are not perfectly beautiful but, they still did a fantastic job but still feel that you could have worked more with colours.At the same time, all the characters were well thought out, there were only a few amounts of characters who all played their role and character. The director did a great job getting rid of all these unnecessary characters that usually exist. Overall, this is probably one of the better movies I've seen and can recommend this to anyone.","

"urema-1","29 March 2022","This fantastical and maniacal bloody indictment of masculine toxicity, and the cut throat world of haute couture and the Wall Street environment, will leave you scared, shocked and confused.We follow the shallow, yet ego-driven and obsessive Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), as he descends further and further into an envious rage, fuelled by his disgust for others, his jealously, and his own desperation to fit in to the high class lifestyle - which, together with his job, is just as cut throat. We see this with the ever present attempts, which border on almost vindictive, of securing the best table at the best restaurants - tables which are reserved only for those are a ""somebody"" in that world.His obsessions and vanity are at times ramped up to the point of humiliation. He tries to dominate and out-perform everyone. However due to the fragility of his self-image and self-worth, the cracks of his persona, and the clear and present disconnection he has to the real world become all to clear for his (real or imaginary) victims.Not knowing who he himself really is, led and driven by vanity and male superiority in a male driven world, he both loses himself in, and is mistaken for, other men with an equally fake and controlled panache - dodging and weaving between Bateman, Smith, Marcus and Davis. Leading us to speculate on which of the crimes and actions he actually committed.In their world, everything has to be immaculate - everything has to be perfect - yet none of them, including Bateman, have the ability to sustain any real meaning or relationships due to their narcissistic pursuits.Is the whole film just a bloody metaphor and criticism for the vile world of trading, toxic masculinity, and the impact they have on others?One of Christian Bales best performances. The film is littered with gems of actors - right down to Reg E. Cathy as the homeless man Bateman kills. Jared Leto is coming off making Requiem for a Dream and a small role in Fight Club, and thus adding to another unique role for him around this time.","

"DarkSpotOn","3 July 2022","I'm going to out and say it right out of the bet, I knew this was not for me, but I had to watch it because it's a classic. It's another slasher movie, if you saw Halloween you saw them all. There was no need for this movie to be as long as it is. The movie is extremely repetitive, and it just stops keeping you interested after the movie keeps going in circles.Christian Bale does his job amazingly. He plays a heartless monster, that is seductive. Yes, the movie is trying to depict, that not everyone that's pretty is good, but it could have been a little bit faster-paced. The movie was ridiculously slow, and there was no plot. It's just about Psycho Patrick, going out of his way to slasher women. That's pretty much the plot.I had to read the Wikipedia article of this movie, just to check if I have missed something, and no. The Wikipedia page just provides everything I have already understood. If this thing was a little faster-paced, and if it had something else except going to a bar, and having sex, it probably could have been way better.I think what keeps this movie loved by so many is just Christian Bale's amazing performance. That's pretty much it. The only character that has any kind of depth is Patrick Bateman, everyone else is just there for the sake of being there. What else can you expect from a slasher movie? I never was that into slasher films, because there are all the same thing, copied.Also during the movie, we do learn that Patrick is struggling to get along and that he lacks empathy. He explains the music he listens to without any energy, he is just heartless, emotionless. The movie in some cases questioned did the murders happen at the end of the film, which was kinda late to do so. I would not be surprised that this movie was inspired by Ted Bundy. Both Patrick and Ted killed pretty women and were seductive and good-looking.Everything was good in this movie, except the story it's self was really not that engaging.","

"noah-65732","27 October 2023","American Psycho is one of my favorite Slasher movies of all times. It's a dark horror comedy about a young Wall Street executive named Patrick Bateman who lives a very high-class lifestyle. He eats at only the finest restaurants, owns only the most expensive products and parties at only the most exclusive night clubs. He has no trouble getting the ladies or hiring escorts but many of the women he takes home never leave if you know what I mean. This film does a great job at portraying Bateman's deep-seeded psychosis, it keeps thing humorous and the cast is great, especially Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman. The humor is a well-played combination of dark comedy and the absolute pompousness of upper class Wall Street Execs in the 1980s. While I've seen this movie a bunch of times and have always considered it a favorite, I recently audiobooked the novel and I can honestly say that I'm glad this film was not an exact adaptation. The film doesn't really get graphic which is actually a good thing because in the book, everything that Bateman does to his female victims is described in detail and it's so twisted and disgusting that releasing those scenes on film would have ruined it. Don't get me wrong, I like violent movies, but sexually torturing women and necrophilia are a bit too much for me. The book also goes on and on about what everyone is wearing in every scene which really starts to get annoying after a while. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the movie is better than the book. I strongly recommend American Psycho to fans of dark horror comedies.","

It goes beyond a satire of a limited range of 1980's yuppy culture, it is an evaluation of American society as a whole. Pay careful attention to the movie's ending and ask what it means.  The meaning is definitely there, but I won't explain it for you, even though it's subtle, I would rather people understood it on their own.  A casual movie goer looking for an exciting thriller will be horribly disappointed, especially by the ending.  However, if you want to see something that combines the best aspects of ""Fight Club,"" ""American Beauty"" and ""Natural Born Killers,"" this movie is a must-see.  A 10.","

"Horst_In_Translation","31 March 2017","I think it is safe to say that almost everybody over the age of 25 has at least heard of the film ""American Psycho"" and so so many have also seen it I am sure. I myself have not until today, so I was certainly curious how this one would turn out. The film runs for slightly under 100 minutes (including credits) and was made back in 2000, so not too long anymore until it has its 20th anniversary. This is the most known work for most of the people involved in the making here, especially director Mary Harron, who is also one of the two writers who adapted the Bret Easton Ellis novel. And even with Bale having the Batman movies in his body of work and an Oscar for a boxing movie, there are still many people who think his turn as Patrick Bateman is still his career-defining role. The character's name said something even to me without having seen this film.But I must say that ultimately I was very disappointed. Bale is an actor who always gives it his everything and the result is that sometimes he is just tremendously good, but on other occasions he is also off the mark and slightly on the hammy side and there were moments like that in ""American Psycho"" too, for example in the one shot with all the blood splatter that reminded me the television show ""Dexter"". Anyway, I still think he elevated the material overall here and is one of the better components. The film itself is a mess in terms of the script at times especially. I think the best moments were probably all the ones in Bateman's apartment and I am not just talking about the bloody murder sequences, but also the conversations. Bateman seems like a cold-blooded killer at times, but then you also feel that it is inside him and that he tries to fight it even, for example when he tries to protect his assistant from the beast that he is. And even if he killed several male characters, especially early on, he is a complete misogynist and I am not somebody who uses this term lightly. Just remember the ""head on a stick"" quote or so. That even shocked the other bankers at his table.Anyway, people who like Bale will probably enjoy this film more than usual. I personally also like Witherspoon, Dafoe and Leto for example and I felt that this trio was so underused and wasted in here. Of course, you can make a point that it is all about Bateman, but still. Dafoe's character is the best example. He seems to smell something is wrong with our ""hero"" here, but it's not about arresting Bateman, not even after the confession and the best example is how the film ends. The very last shot. I will not go into detail about this one any more. You will know what I mean when you see it. Anyway, overall very little is really memorable here apart from Bale's performance perhaps and the general subject. But there are hundreds (maybe thousands) of other films about serial killers out there that aren't worse to be honest. And these do not get 1% of the attention that this one here is getting. After watching this one, I can see why critics do not like it as much as general audiences. I think ""American Psycho"" is a really overseen movie (does that word exist? the opposite of underseen) and also very overrated. If you are among the very few who haven't seen it yet, I suggest you keep it that way. You really aren't missing too much.","

"framptonhollis","14 December 2015","""American Psycho"" is one of the absolute greatest films that I've seen recently. It includes almost all of my favorite things that can be included in a film. There's a good soundtrack, dark comedy, satire, disturbing dramatic elements, and some EXCELLENT performances.While I, of course, love the direction, script, dialogue, etc., Christian Bale's performance may be the absolute highlight of the film. At times, he's really hilarious (in a very odd way), and, at others, he is terrifying. There's some scenes that come across really chilling,solely because of his amazing and threatening performance. This is, without a doubt, the greatest Bale performance of all time. Sure, his performance as Batman is more popular, but, come on! Here, he manages to perfectly capture the film's tone using hilarity and horror, while with Batman he just makes that annoying, weird voice. Sure, Batman has to hide the fact that he's actually Bruce Wayne, but could you choose a better, less silly and over the top voice?All Batman rants aside, this is one truly excellent film that really impressed me on every possible level.","

But the movie is not intelligent. I know this movie is based on a book, but since I haven't read it I can only talk about the movie itself. First of all, the dimwittedness of the movie is betrayed by the character called ""Luis"". The idea may be ok that he admits to be in love with the other man and always kept it a secret up to now, since this shows that the emotions the people show are fake. But this all is spoiled by adding the usual brainless cliches attached to same-gender attracted men to the character: his effeminate behavior etc. From the first moment you see him, you know that if the movie is as bad as you think it is, he will be revealed to be same-gender  attracted. And the scene where he reveals his love is so ridiculous! Sure, if somebody puts his hands around my neck indoors in black leather gloves, the first thing that comes to my mind is that he loves me! There where one or two more scenes that betrayed the usual odd uneasiness of this kind of movies with same-gender attraction. The final scenes in the flat, and the killing of Christie are just the usual slasher-movie scenes. But, the idea that when he throws the chainsaw at her from the top of the stairs while she is at the lowest level and *actually* hits her while running is so dumb I couldn't help laughing! I mean, if this was just an ordinary slasher flick it would be ok, maybe even big fun, but *this* movie wants to pretend to be intellectual? Please! In his final speech Paul simply says nothing, but in a very complex way.Oh yes, and his name: Bateman. Hmm, does this ring a bell? Norman Bates? Boy, how original. But I liked the characters of Christie and Jean, and the actresses portraying them. I also liked the actress that had the line ""Don't come back"" at the end of the movie. But what I really didn't like was that a song by the Mediaeval Baebes is wasted in a trashy movie like this! Sure, Bale has a hot body, but that doesn't save the movie. So, don't waste your time.","

"kclipper","3 May 2015","Christian Bale is top notch in this dark comedy that compares serial killer-like sociopathic traits to the drives and ambitions of the opportunists of the New York stock exchange. The setting is the trendy night clubs and big city environment of the 1980's, and Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is an executive investment banker who just so happens to have a psychopathic personality that lacks emotion and lusts after torture, murder, greed and social status. His mask of sanity is so well portrayed that eventually when his alter ego gets the best of him, his colleagues and associates do not believe that he is able to commit the crimes he is confessing to.This is a well thought out production by Director, Mary Harron who's screenplay is based on a Bret Easton Ellis novel. Bale plays the ego-maniacal Patrick to sheer perfection. His character, although extremely narcissistic and murderous in nature, displays a guilty conscious that inevitably results in a complete breakdown. The content of the film is dementedly hilarious, as Bateman amorally murders the homeless, mutilates prostitutes, and kills his fellow colleagues over things as simple as business cards and professional status. Bale is excellent at playing a fictional but very complex character, and the film captures the predatory aspects of the big city executive hierarchy. Director, Harron seems to present a statement on the hjman ego and how destructive and desensitized it can be. Comedic touches include Bale chasing a prostitute with a chainsaw through the stairwell of an apartment building completely naked and screaming, and staring himself in a mirror while having sex with prostitutes revealing his complete obsession with his own self image. Its a psychological thriller combined with a twisted sense of humor and appreciation of the musical culture of the 1980's. It features music by Huey Lewis and the News, Genesis, and Robert Palmer, and it all centers on Bateman's ability to irrationally justify his destructive tendencies and descend into a world of madness and depravity. Willem Defoe is a detective hot on his trail and Reese Witherspoon is his self-absorbed, unknowing girlfriend. Audiences will laugh and bewilder over this structurally complicated, satirical character study. Its a story about climbing the ladder of success while disintegrating morally and leaving behind a spiritless, empty shell, but it never ceases to be entertaining.","

"pulpficat","28 September 2023","If you're looking for a film that will make you question your own sanity while laughing at the absurdity of it all, American Psycho is the perfect mind-bending cocktail. In a world where conformity reigns supreme, this film takes us on a wickedly entertaining journey into the deranged mind of Patrick Bateman.Christian Bale's performance as the enigmatic and psychopathic Wall Street investment banker is nothing short of iconic. His portrayal seamlessly shifts between the charming and charismatic yuppie of the '80s and the sadistic serial killer lurking just beneath the surface. Bale's commitment to the role is both chilling and darkly hilarious.The film's satirical take on the excesses of the '80s yuppie culture is razor-sharp. It's a world where business cards are scrutinized with more intensity than murder mysteries, and the pursuit of the perfect reservation at Dorsia is a matter of life and death. Patrick Bateman's obsession with materialism and his meticulous grooming rituals are a reflection of the shallow, narcissistic values of the era.Mary Harron's direction infuses the film with a darkly comedic tone that keeps you uncomfortably entertained throughout. She skillfully balances the macabre and the absurd, creating a narrative that blurs the line between reality and Bateman's delusional fantasies. The film's use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for Bateman's psychosis is both unsettling and brilliant. The film's palette of dark, muted colors and a hauntingly retro soundtrack add to the film's unsettling charm.American Psycho is a wicked satire that subverts expectations at every turn and delves deep into the psyche of a man teetering on the edge of madness. This film isn't just a psychological thriller; it's a darkly hilarious and thought-provoking film that challenges our perception of reality, forcing us to question whether Bateman's atrocities are real or merely the twisted product of his mind. And it's also a biting social commentary on the emptiness of consumer culture and the dehumanizing effects of unchecked capitalism.","

This character is such a deep person and every experience he goes through makes him deeper. Movie is so successful about making term descriptions and telling Bateman's mind. Also it goes in a serious tone and it makes us thrilled. American Psycho has bloodcurdling sequences. Story is not so clear, it left some questions behind of it. I think reading the book is necessary to understand everything better. I didn't but movie made me excited for reading it.","

"axapvov","9 May 2023","At times absurdist comedy, horror slasher, psycho thriller... ultimately a very clever classic film, although it probably misses a lot of content from the novel. Right from the opening credits there's a play on appearances, mistaking juice for blood. Superficiality and the cult of appearances, ""inside doesn't matter"" is a spear through the heart of Judeo-American capitalist society. Monstrous inequality, as portrayed in scenes with a homeless man and a prostitute. People as commodities, which, to be clear, is the same conclusion Pasolini came to when he addressed fascism. All this and much more is successfully presented in scenes such as the one with the personal cards, as sharp as it is hilarious. We are avatars. Chloë Sevigny's character puzzles me, and it's one of the things that might be lost in this film adaptation. The same goes for the detective's hints and the entire last act, of which I have my own theories.The suspense is simple but effective, the horror imagery is sparse but perfectly timed and it's definitely an achievement how seamlessly it combines different tones and rhythms. I'm not sure what to make of the album reviews but I think they were pretty good.I'm so late to the party, I just never felt like watching this, not sure what to expect. It's probably been widely misunderstood, I'm sure feminists view it as an unintentional documentary (to be fair it's worrying how some men seem to like it unironically). In reality the same observations can be made today, they're just as relevant. Yuppies have only changed in a matter of aesthetics, we have the same pill-driven rat race. A lot of women today behave as Batemen and Batewomen, getting away with murder. That name must be a little nod to Batman, I guess Bruce Wayne is the ultimate yuppie. It's amazing that Christian Bale played both roles.","

"Boba_Fett1138","30 November 2010","This is one very well done movie, that got greatly directed and acted out by its impressive cast.It's not really a movie that follows a clear main story but it instead gives us a view in the head of a young, successful and handsome guy, who seemingly has it all but behind his human mask actually is being an emotionless, murderous psychopath, who starts executing his weird fantasies during the nights. He more and more starts loosing it and looses both his grip on reality and the ability to keep himself and his urges under control. In all honesty, the best serial killer movies are all like this and instead of picking a real storyline it focuses more on the madness and its main character.It's a pleasantly directed movie, that picks a more light approach, rather than an heavy serious one and it takes us into the insane world and mind of the main character. The movie doesn't ever really become an odd or eccentric one but it still does a very good job at capturing the right mood and atmosphere.But it's also really definitely true that the movie and its characters work out due to the acting. Christian Bale is really perfect and quite amazing that this guy still hasn't been nominated for an Oscar, considering all of the great roles he has played over the last couple of years, this movie of course included. He's perfectly obsessive, cocky and charming and he was for a huge part responsible for me liking this movie as much as i did. But the movie also really has an impressive supporting cast list. It aren't really the names that are know by the big audience but it are names that are always respected and liked by the experts. Not to sound nit-picky but I wasn't as pleased with the casting of some of the female roles. Not because they're not great actors but more because of their very plain looks. The character of Bateman is supposed to be surrounded, admired and chased after by the most beautiful women and I'm sorry but most women in this movie just aren't that impressive looking. Perhaps it's due to the fact that this is a movie that got directed by a female, so she might not have had such an eye for it as a man would had. But this is about really the only thing that slightly bothered me about this movie, which should tell you something about how great it is.It's really a movie that I liked watching because of how beautifully insane it all got done.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

"K-Slicer","11 October 2002","As much as any movie lover out there, I don't mind certain levels of gratuitous violence.  ""American Psycho"" though took to a level that it shouldn't have been taken too.  (spoiler here) The scene with the homeless man and the two prostitutes was not needed.  After the prostitute scene, I had to shut it off.  Besides the violence, the shallowness and vileness of Bale's Patrick Bateman made my skin crawl.  He is a nut job of the highest order and he needed to be taken out.  The only decent scene in this very horrible glimpse into the mind of a yuppie whose gone over the cuckoo's nest was nothing at all.  The dialogue in the film was sharp and the performances of Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, and Jared Leto were all right but that was it.  The other characters were annoying, shallow, and inept and the setting was too much in the 1980's (very off-putting).  Overall, ""American Psycho"" is a film that no one should see under any circumstances.  I give it 1 out of 10.","

"markinbarnet","29 June 2001","This had the potential to be brilliant, but is very poorly written.
The dialogue is weak to say the least. The main character's dialogue is inane and pretentious, and the feeble attempt to add depth by petty obsessiveness does not work to the judging eye.Also he is remarkably insecure, which is greatly at odds with his achievement in life - a brilliant, calculating careerman, which is what he must have been up to this point in his life to get the office that he has!
In the parts where Bale is about to wreak havoc, he embarks on post-modern soliloquy, based on the careers of Pop Stars. No doubt, the aim of these commentaries, was to chill our spines, that this highly reasoning, exponent of individualism, could use his intelligence to mindlessly chop people up!However, rather than being spine tingling, the dialogue merely bores us to death and the victims surely would not have felt any pain, and they would have been rendered unconscious by his mind-numbing long before he got around to dismembering them.Where the hell was the end? Perhaps they realized it was going to be as pants as the rest of the movie and cut it!The scariest part of the film is the Close up of Phil Collins C.D. Cover!Sorry Christian, this film couldn't cut mustard, let alone it's victims!","

Patrick is a man who is a Wall Street magnet who loves to put all kinds of creams and lotions all over his body, tans himself and is as fit as a fiddle.

Patrick decides to eliminate one of his buddies, Paul Allen by chopping him up with a heavy ax and simply drags his body out of the lobby with the blood staining he floor. This mad man rapes and performs horrible things to people even animals and also has an apartment filled with dead bodies.

"FlickJunkie-2","9 September 2000","Not having read the book, I will take this film on its own merits. `American Psycho' is a satirical horror film that had greater potential than was realized.  Mary Harron's adaptation and direction seems to be the problem.  Part of the story was a lampoon of the excessive materialism of the 1980's, focusing particularly on the yuppie lifestyle.  That should have served as the background for the character study.  However, Harron pushed it to the foreground and exaggerated the portrayals of yuppie superficiality and arrogance to the point where it became sophomoric.  She then pounded on the point until it was threadbare.The film would have benefited from more development of Bateman's tortured inner self rather than this obsession with his and his friends' way of life. The story presented an opportunity for a fresh approach to the horror genre.  Most horror films are presented from the perspective of the victims, whereas this story was from the killer's perspective.  In addition, since it was a first person narrative, we had an opportunity to look inside the killer's head.  Though some of that was done, too much of the introspection focused on his thoughts about his lifestyle and not enough on his feelings about the people he was killing or the acts themselves.Another problem is that the killings were sloppily done.  In most cases it is inconceivable that he wouldn't have been immediately apprehended based on all the forensic evidence he was leaving behind.  This is the director's way of giving us a not so subtle push as to how to interpret the ending.  If the killings were masterfully planned and executed, the ending would have been much more perplexing and effective.  The acting by Bale was excellent.  Though I didn't agree with Harron's vision of Bateman as the poster child for yuppie conceit and tawdriness, Christian Bale played the caricature to the hilt.  He was more pompous and supercilious than your typical Roman Emperor.  The scene depicting his emotional disintegration was terrifically done and very intense.Overall, the way the story was presented created an air of incredulity about all the characters and their behavior, which took the effectiveness out of the psychological angle.  That left us with a mindless horror flick with only mediocre effects.  Despite some excellent acting, I rated this film a 4/10.  A directorial hack job marred a good story concept.  Since it failed miserably at the box office, the film's best hope is that it becomes a cult classic in rental.  It is kitsch enough for that to be a distinct possibility.","

"sddavis63","10 March 2001","I don't know quite what to do with this movie. Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a young, Wall Street powerbroker type who, in his spare time, enjoys critiquing albums, kinky sex and murder - and not necessarily in that order! Bale - the only actor in the movie of any significance - is actually rather good in the part, as he shows Bateman descending farther and farther into insanity, finally reaching out for help but not being able to find anyone who believes him. He goes a little overboard at times, but then again that's in keeping with the character.My basic problem with the movie was that I didn't think it ever decided where it wanted to go. It's publicized as a thriller, and as a thriller it's absolutely awful. I first thought that it might be a serious attempt to construct a psychological profile of a serial killer. Forget that. There's no serious attempt to do anything in this movie. It doesn't work too well as a straight thriller either, for one simple reason: there's nothing particularly frightening about it! It simply contains the normal slasher-type violence you would expect in this genre, and, of course, grotesquely mutilated bodies pop up in the most unexpected places - except that, because we've seen these types of movies before, we expect them to pop up! But, on the other hand, maybe this could be looked at as one of those ""thrillers"" that's so bad it's actually funny. (Or, maybe it's actually intended to be a black comedy. If so, it's not too bad.) And, at times, it really is funny! Let's just say that I spent far more time laughing than I did perched on the edge of my seat!Aside from Bale's performance (and I'm still not sure if he put on a great comedic performance or a lousy dramatic performance) the supporting cast was mediocre. Willem Dafoe had little to do in the role of Donald Kimball, a police detective who seems to be suspicious of Bateman as he investigates one of the murders, but then seems to do little to follow up on his suspicions except take Bateman out to lunch. The best performance of the weak supporting cast was probably that of Cara Seymour as the prostitute Christie, who becomes a participant in Bateman's kinky games.So, again, what to do with this? Maybe just forget it and ""return the video?"" (You have to have seen the movie to understand that reference.) Or maybe that's too harsh. I mean, it isn't terrible; it's just not very good. The combination of a lousy thriller and a not-so-bad comedy (and, I might add, that either way it falls apart with what I thought was a terribly weak ending) gives this a rating of 4/10.","

"jay4stein79-1","19 March 2006","There are at least ten reasons why you should watch this wonderful, macabre movie:10) Justin Theroux is in the movie and he went to Bennington. So did Bret Easton Ellis, who you undoubtedly know wrote the book this movie is based on, but they didn't attend at the same time. That's okay though because I just like that a Bennington alumnus starred in a film based on a book by another alumnus. That and I think Theroux can be talented when working with a decent director, as he does here. 9) They kill Jared Leto's character. Any movie that does that gets at least an additional two stars. It can make a mediocre movie into something I would describe as ""a good way to spend two hours"" (Panic Room, I'm looking at you). 8) The book is pretty much unreadable, to me, and not because of its gore (though there's some rough stuff there); it's just boring and the pages and pages and pages about Huey Lewis really aren't that fascinating to anyone other than BEE. 7) The obligatory defusing of misogyny: It was made by a woman! The Patrick Bateman character kills women (grusomely)! So it's okay! I'm not sure I buy that line of reasoning. Frankly, the violence against women here is appropriate because, duh, we're not supposed to like Patrick Bateman. We're supposed to see him as a product of his deluded times. We're supposed to understand that he's either become unhinged as a result of contemporary impersonality or he's a monster because of that impersonality. 6) Willem Defoe's performance as an inept version of Columbo (who was inept enough as it was) is brilliant. 5) The film is delirious, completely. It moves fast and, in a lot of ways, seems as insane as its anti-protagonist. However, it never feels that it's out of control; you know all the time that the filmmakers know how crazy, absurd, and darkly funny the material and performances are. It's almost like some gruesome, EC comic from the 1950s. That's a compliment. 4) Reese Witherspoon3) Remember how I complained about pages upon pages in the book that expound upon the virtues of Phil Collins and Huey Lewis? Here they work because their shorter and, frankly, they're visual jokes, ultimately. Who knew it was funnier to actually watch a deranged psychopath go after someone with an ax while discussing Sussudio?2) Christian Bale proves yet again that he needs more work. I'm glad he's getting more of it now, but I think those of us that saw this and Velvet Goldmine were wondering why we weren't seeing more of him. 1) It's just a very very good movie that many people will find enjoyable. Unless they dislike bloodshed, in which case they should stay away.","

Still, throughout the film the motivation of the main character seems to be to keep killing without getting caught. I couldn't figure out other goal, so I didn't feel any interest for the ending. We have the detective who seems to be talking the story somewhere but didn't make any difference. The film is full of clever moments and some humor, but these don't advance the plot. It was mostly entertaining, hence the 7. At the end, we get this speech that I struggle to make sense of. What is the evolution or change in the characters or the story?","

Thank god that I didn't. His character is similar to his later character that he portrays in SHAFT. He kills his victims out of rage and anguish. All in all, the film is a good insight to the types of living conditions that we have today. Rich kid kills someone and just gets away with it because he is rich. That blows!

"adeckofcards","26 June 2020","When you think about a tape about a psychopath, a violent drama-like story instantly comes to mind. In 'American Psycho' this totally changes, when reporting criminal acts in a satirical way.
The film tells the story of Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street worker who murders people at night. The greatest achievement of the film is the development of the main character. The story, being told from its subjective point of view, acquires an absolutely well-made introspection. Unfortunately it is one of the few good things it achieves. The script is pretty weak, so weak that at its end point it can't support itself and leaves plenty of holes behind. This same script risks everything to develop the protagonist and leaves out all the other characters, with minimal development.
Generally speaking, the film doesn't have much more to offer than a well-developed character and the odd funny sequence, even if it's totally ridiculous and implausible. Although, despite everything, the performance of Christian Bale (even without being the best of his career) manages to enhance a rather weak film.","

It was more silly than horrific and I just didn't get it.In one scene he is Patrick and the next scene he is someone else.  The plot makes no sense.One minute he is in his apartment, the next he is showing us his dead body and head collection and chasing someone with a chainsaw in what appears to be an abandoned warehouse.  Is it all a dream? Probably. After he freaks out and confesses to his lawyer on the phone (who doesn't even know his real name h, right], we find out from the lawyer that one of his victims is still alive.  The whole movie is boring and the last 15 minutes of the film should have been cut.2 animals down (If you saw the movie-you'll know what I mean, well at least 1 down anyway).Christian Bale was ok but I wasn't impressed with him in this role or the role he played in Velvet Goldmine.  I don't get the attraction and I don't think I ever will.","

"ironcraftleague","9 January 2019","I love the character of Patrick Bateman and how the movie goes deeper and deeper into his mind. When he goes insane you feel the dread, suspense, and murderous intention out of someone you thought was trustful. Aside from that, a lot of things are done well. Such as his murder spree which was a great touch of action and overall carnage that felt controlled yet totally savage (you can kinda sum up the feel of the film by saying that). However, things weren't explain that I still didn't get which made me a little disappointed. Why was this big confession nothing? How did the cops not find him? It's kinda open ended, which could be smart, but it feels a little lazy. I'd if they explained those small details, but I could understand due to run time. Still a little upsetting though. 9/10.","

That's really just Bale's great performance though. In addition, the overall dryness and shallow feeling nature given off from the other actors is something that makes it funnier, and one of the my favorite comedies.","

"d_fienberg","11 November 2000","I may be in a decided minority in feeling that Mary Harron has, thus far, built a career on draining all excitement from her material. I Shot Andy Warhol featured a number of interesting performances and a fine script, but the direction completely dulled any of the fun that you would expect from the Warhol Factory and its hangers-on. Similarly, with her adaptation of American Psycho, Harron has gotten a number of fine performances from her cast, and the writing seems sharp, but the direction is so completely without the necessary flair that it seems largely lacking as a whole.Bret Easton Ellis's novel of Yuppie Decadence was only barely cutting edge when it came out. Readers have mistake Ellis's flamboyant writing style for substance, ignoring the fact that even in the mid to late 80s, social critics didn't really feel like the decade had much depth. The book is a violent satire that naysayers misread as literal, but which its cult (and it seems that thousands of people still love the book for whatever reason) have mistaken for profound. However, say what you will about it's quality, the book is either a fantastic success or a thunderous failure. It's hard to be ambivalent.Harron's movie, though, can easily produce a ho-hum reaction. It seems counterproductive to mention it, but it's almost unavoidable to think of what might have happened had the film been made by Oliver Stone and Leonardo DiCaprio, who were both rumoured to be interested at one point. Stone would have been the perfect director to handle the material for better or for worse. In my opinion, Stone probably would have made a horrible, flashy, loud, misguided movie, much in the tradition of Brian DePalma's awe-inspiringly wrong-headed Bonfire of the Vanities. But he could have made the film another Wall Street, a brilliant satire. Similarly, it's very possible that DiCaprio would have been so miscast as to make the film laughable. Or he may have given a wonderful and unexpected performance. Regardless, the film would have been alive.It's not really Harron's fault that the material is dated. Ellis at least was working in his contemporary milieu. Some of his observations may have seemed biting. For Harron to mine humour from the killer's passion for Phil Collins seems counter productive. The jokes are just obvious. American Psycho has no more currency than any other piece of 80s parody or nostalgia. It's more like Romy and Michelle Kill Everyone at Their High School Reunion.But the film still remains watchable. And, even more surprising,  after being forced to watch the film a second time, it didn't get any worse, as such surface glosses often tend to. Christian Bale's performance is a comedic masterwork, a super combination of flawlessly dark line readings and chilling physical comedy. Bale certainly has never had so much fun in a film before and it's doubtful that he'll ever get such juicy material again. Willem Defoe is similarly relishes his role as a slightly daffy private eye. However, in keeping with the piece, much of the rest of the cast seems to be sleepwalking through their performances. Samantha Mathis, Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, and Jared Leto all play desicated characters, so it isn't surprising that none of them have the chance to do their best work.American Psycho is violent, but not overwhelmingly so. It's sexual, but not enough to really offend anybody. And it's intense, but probably not enough to endanger old hearts. The question with Ellis's book was always whether or not it could be adapted for the screen. Well, clearly it can be. The only question remaining is whether Mary Harron should have bothered.I'd give it a generous 6/10, largely because it didn't bore me the second time around.","

"jmgimbel","20 June 2021","American Psycho has more than a touch of irony and isn't really about murder.It was an homage to the extreme excess and greed of the 80s, with no one at the top accountable. The invincibility of youth as a trust fund baby, doing everything at full speed, women, drugs, et al. Being concerned with the facade of life than bothering to examine it or relationships and the inherent loneliness that inspired.It's funny af if not taken literally. The darkness more a metaphor.The book is really fun as well.","

It goes beyond portraying an 80's yuppie into a realm where anyone would recognize that he's completely unstable. There is no subtlety at all. The writers continually force down your throat that this movie takes place in the 1980's in a very inorganic way. It's like ""Yep, we get it already, you've proven your knowledge of 80's pop music."" It's not only Bale's character that's unbelievable, it's every character. Nothing rings true. It's as if the writers and actors had heard stories about the 80's but never lived through those years and are putting on some grade school production. You can skip this one.","

"Rimmer-10","23 July 2001","************ SPOILERS ******************** My mistake was that I've read the book before I saw the movie - big mistake. My image of Pat Bateman was a hyper violent nutcase in perfect disguise - controlling and manipulating his environment in his ""normal"" life and murdering and torturing at nighttime. But the insanity should be visible throughout - in every move he makes.The movie and Christian Bale *tries* to make that image, but they just don't make it - Bale is not able to balance on the edge between insanity and normal - he does not convince me at all. And that is a major flaw since the entire movie is based upon this image.I don't want to see the gore, the blood or the rat thing - it would have made me really sick (I almost vomitted when I read the book) - that is not what I'm lacking in this movie. I want Christian Bale to convince me as Pat Bateman - that's not easy I know - I guess only two or three actors could have pulled it off and Christian Bale is not among those. Sorry to say it but it really ruins the movie.The ending of the movie is strange but it really just follows the book. I believe it wants us to ask this question: ""was all this just a dream in Pat Batemans sick mind - that he in need for some action just invented the whole thing ... or has the society just accepted that these brutal murders are OK - a sort of apathy as seen in Se7en?"".The book: 8 of 10, the movie: 4 of 10.","

"view_and_review","28 December 2020","""Are we really in the head of a homicidal maniac?"" is what I was thinking while watching this movie. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) was fastidiously neat, religious about his morning cleaning and exercise routine, and very knowledgeable about his 80's music. The life he was leading-- working in downtown, making good money, going to lunch and dinner at chic places-- was all shallow and mundane. Emotionally he had nothing but rage and indifference. He was almost an invisible man. His fiance didn't listen to him, he was frequently called by the wrong name, and he moved about almost unnoticed. In other words, he had all the markers of a serial killer and serially kill he did. He moved about with frequent narrations to himself which kept us apprised on what he was thinking or feeling, yet it seemed as though something was missing. I think some crucial information was missing at the end which could've helped greatly with understanding --my understanding anyway.","

"asphyxion_","23 December 2019","I love American Psycho. It's excessive in every way: from the violence to the sexual situations and fantasies, to its blatant dialogue exchanges, to its senseless murderous rampaging violence, but mostly it's excessive in its malignant consumeristic narcissism. And one can't help but feel that the excessive narcissism is exactly the point of the entire film. It's almost as if the movie itself is an actual cinematic-embodiment of the personality disorder that Patrick Bateman so heavily suffers from. American Psycho also does an amazing job at encapsulating all the base desires of the male psyche, and then amplifying them in an almost poetic way to paint the perfect picture of who exactly Bateman is and just how insane he can truly be. And what makes the entire thing so effective is how easily possible the movie makes one realize that any man could be driven to be such an egotistical jacka$$ if given the right circumstances in life.There's also a lot of subtle but perfect dark humor in the film. Especially the  contest that is the Business Card Show and Tell that the men engage in periodically. You'll notice how everyone is a ""Vice President"" -- an obvious jab at the crony corporate nepotism on Wall Street/big business and how the 'higher ups' are really just useless drones who do nothing. Case in point: Patrick telling his secretary to hold all his calls for the day because he'll be too swamped with work, but then immediately kicking his feet up on the desk and turning Jeopardy on on the television as soon as his secretary leaves the office and closes his door.What surprises me the most about American Psycho is that it was directed and written by women. It's not that I think women are incapable of creating good movies, but more that the subject content of the film/script is drenched in testosterone and misogyny, so it ultimately feels like it was crafted by men. Then again, in retrospect it probably took a woman's touch to really show the absurdity of Bateman's extremely toxic masculinity and malignant narcissism in its absurdist and repugnant light. A male director/writer team probably would have made Bateman a more sympathetic egoist, and I'm sure that defeats the entire point of what the movie is really trying to say in the first place.My only gripe with the film is with the casting of Bateman. Don't get me wrong, Christian Bale did an incredible job but its not without warranted criticism. Bateman's tangents into the ridiculous by way of prolific verbal dissertations on Huey Lewis and The News or Phil Collins, while freakin' hilarious, feel a little too forced. And that forced feeling is a consistent issue throughout the movie--Bateman's excessive egotism doesn't always feel natural, and it ultimately mars the film's immersion/continuity. I read a review that suggest Charlie Sheen as Patrick Bateman, and honestly I couldn't imagine a more perfect real-life egotistical maniac to portray Bateman. Charlie Sheen from Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" with Patrick Bateman's book personality would have been excellent here.Ultimately, the movie doesn't really spoonfeed you a conclusion (although it gives you hints throughout the entire film) and so its ambiguity gives it a more intellectual bent to its portrayal of insane cathartic self indulgence. I'm of the mind that everything was in Bateman's head and he truly is crazy, but both sides of the argument have valid reasons for why they either do or do not believe Bateman really did what we saw on the screen. This and the fact that the movie clocks in at just a hair over 100 minutes and you've got a highly rewatchable piece of entertainment. 9/10 Solid A rating","

"jjjjjj-18","2 December 2009","I was looking forward to see this one after reading a lot of positive comments about this one in IMDb....Now that i have seen it, i am posting a comment because I want to do my bit in helping any other prospective viewer from seeing this.First of all...i will admit this is NOT a bad movie...but it is not a movie you want to look forward to either....I have said this is NOT a bad movie, because I could sit through the movie without getting too bored. I kept on waiting for the ""good parts"" until the end of the movie.Let me also tell you that for any movie reading a book should not be a pre-requisite....if there is , then that is a flaw with the movie.The movie deals with a psychotic character Patrick Baleman who hides his psychotic part from his co-workers and friends(?)....In reality Bateman has no friends, everyone is superficial...As the movie progresses Bateman's veil of sanity slowly falls off....When you watch the movie, you are unable to interpret what is real and what is imaginary....The film depicts how these could co-exist.....It depicts the movie from the view-point of a psychotic So why did i find it boring???? 1)Because there were no clear explanation of why Bateman became a psychotic....it is not necessary that a movie explains this...but I find it interesting only if that is explained...Then the movie can be enjoyed ....You find fun to see a mind unravel...FightClub is a good example...Apart from the fact that FightClub deals with a more ""visually interesting"" psychiatry case viz MPD....there is a proper logical explanation of the main character became a psychotic....not the case with American Psycho....Add to this the fact the condition he suffers from is not a very ""visually stimulating"" one and that it is in fact depicted in a boring fashion, makes it a forgettable movie experience.Let me give you an analogy....People enjoy playing chess, its fun to use our mind designing strategies...Its even fun to watch a game of chess....You find it fun to watch the moves, how one player uses a strategy and how the other counters it....But can u enjoy a game of chess if you don't understand whats going on -if the game goes above you head(like if two top level players are playing)....Now imagine a situation where two fools are playing it...Again u can't find it interesting to watch their game....u don't get it, because there is nothing to get!!!! I don't see where is the fun in knowing just that Bateman is paranoid...Afterall you are seeing American Psycho and Mateman himself declares from the start that ""I am mad"" 2)Also because..some psychiatry oriented themes can be interesting even if u don't get an explanation of the psychosis...if the premise is interesting...""Identity"" is a good example, there is no explanation as to why there is the disease per se.....but the premise was interesting...In American Psycho there is no premise, because the boundaries between real an imaginary is not clear...You see hallucination after hallucination or delusion after delusion...interspersed with reality -but you don't know which is which and you soon loose interest (atleast I did) In short I found nothing interesting with American Psycho I believe people find it interesting because they think this is a masterpiece and you are supposed to like it.One guy has said (in another comment) American Psycho is fascinating because Bateman is a complex character..yes it is complex...its more than complex it is psychotic, but not interesting....I don't find it interesting to know that how a psychotic can exist with a a very thin superficial mask of sanity....Here i think the director is at fault or the writer of the book...that they failed to make it interesting.....Why would anyone want to know about someone just because he is psychotic The only thing I found interesting in American Psycho was to note how Bateman's co-workers could be so indifferent to his problems...in fact they don't even realize there is a problem!!!!!","

"Manal1987","26 May 2011","American Psycho is a movie that digs psychologically in order to hit socially. The story is certainly brilliant and mind-spinning, thanks to Bret Easton's book. American Psycho is about an apathetic successful rich young man, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) who suffers from grave psychological disturbances that make him go into killing frenzies. One of the first lines that Bateman says in the movie goes as follows: ""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there."" These words apparently set the stage for the events to follow in the film. This idea of being an abstraction resurfaces at the end, making things clearer. American Psycho does not criticize Bateman as an individual. Being and abstraction, he stands for all the 1980s yuppies; this class of young gentlemen who nearly had everything: fame, money and success, yet were vain, stupid, materialistic and superficial from the inside, and who also lost touch with their society and humanity. Sharing the same characteristics is beautifully represented in the movie more than once as everybody gets mistaken for somebody else. Thus, since the idiosyncrasies disappear, the whole society manifests itself in one facade-like individual: Patrick Bateman. Bateman is extremely self-conscious; he is obsessed with cleanness, health, looks and fancy clothes, which almost applies to everyone else. Bateman starts having this killing fits in which he murders prostitutes, strangers and even his colleagues in cold blood. However, unlike the common analysis, I tend to believe that these murders are real, but since Bateman is not an individual as I mentioned before, they are committed by the whole society. How he gets away with all his murders and insults people without them responding show that he is a recurrent case... a collective human condition with no material existence. Christian Bale has certainly excelled himself with this hauntingly beautiful performance. To be able to capture the anxiety, rage, vanity and insanity of an entire society and represent them in one character is sheer brilliance and exquisite talent.","

One of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the conceited misunderstanding that they (the yuppies) are the only ones sophisticated enough to understand art. While the movie ignores this characteristic and instead focuses on their misunderstandings of dinning, I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same conceited taste in films as the characters do in their choice of dinner. If these pompous characters that were in this movie have a video library at home, I would bet that American Psycho would be one of those movies.","

"Rammstein-2","30 May 2000","I didn't feel anything when I saw this film. The book made me disgusted, furious, had me laughing and nodding in consent with the clever insights into the idiotic life of Patrick Bateman. This film had nothing of it, and it although it was a good movie, it's far from being anything more than average.I won't say that I miss the endless torture-scenes of the book, it was clear right away that those were not possible to show to ANY extent. The mere suggestion of them and the notebook that Jean flips through near the end are enough to make one understand just how sick this person is. And Bates' performance is just excellent, perfect - he masters this role like none other. Just look at him phoning his lawyer: ""I just have to kill a lot of people!"" Brilliant.But the blandness of this film is on another level: the director just fails to convey the sentiment of total detachment that Bateman feels. He interacts with people, talks to them and even feels something for them, as in the case of his girlfriend, whom he dumps so that he won't harm her. All this is okay, for he wouldn't pass for a normal human being if he didn't. He leads two lives. His ""normal"" life is okay, well portrayed, and the moments where his second life, that of the blood-thirsty maniac, tries to grab hold of his sanity, are well made.But there is still something missing. And I can't really tell what. All I can say is that this film didn't make me feel what I thought I would feel: these people exist. There are people like Bateman, surely - but the film makes him unique.So go see it, for all that it matters. But I'd much rather read the book.","

Intriguing shocker with brilliant technical value starring Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman peeling off a face mask to reveal the new him. He identifies himself through business cards while pulling away from humanity. He ignores his fiancé, disregards his secretary, and his apartment is strewn with bodies. Director Mary Harron is stylish particularly during a sequence where Bateman pursues a prostitute through corridors while hoisting a chainsaw. Confusing at times yet observant character study. Bale struggles to maintain his sanity as everyday life eludes him and grim images become a difficult battle of reality and fantasy until we are unsure his future. Willem Dafoe plays a cop investigating a disappearance and he hints too close to the facts during questioning. Chloe Sevigny plays his insecure secretary who faces his crass behaviour yet open to a date where she is unknowingly spared until she views his thoughts upon a sketch pad. Jared Leto plays a successful business person who will become a victim in Bateman's recent memory. Reese Witherspoon plays Bateman's naive girlfriend who insists they're engage despite his disgust for her. Were the murders committed or just a product of paranoia? Score: 9 / 10","

"Rodrigo_Amaro","31 December 2012","Patrick Bateman is the epitome of what success really is or at least the idea propagated by the media of what this must be. Wealthy, amazingly good-looking, powerful, cultured enough to make valuable points about the artists he likes and he's engaged with a rich and beautiful woman. There's only one thing on his way to achieve perfection: he kills people. Maybe that's what makes him feel complete within himself. But then again what's he doing with his life? Is he really doing the things he thinks he's doing?""American Psycho"" pulls plenty of tricks to convey its message on how thin the line between sanity and insanity really is, and there's so much to take into account that one does not fully understands the movie in just one view. It looks something simple to be solved but it's just the other way around. The more you see it the more you realize how shaky everything is, nothing and no one is reliable. Speaking of reliable, Bateman (played by a flawless Christian Bale) isn't much of a trusty character, but not in the sense he fools people, pretending to be nice to later murder them. It's more that he's so over the top in some of his actions and reactions that he's completely unbelievable, specially when things start to turn upside down for him, he doesn't get credit for his acts. But is he really there? No one seems to be listening to what's he saying. How much of Bateman's murders are real or just imagination or maybe fantasies of his twisted persona? If they're real what's the pleasure in killing people? There's madness, hysteria, ecstasy, laughs whenever he's slaying and brutalizing his victims, frequently preceded of long opinions on the musicians he listens to. But there's no true enjoyment afterwards. We can't see that on his face or some sense of gain in getting rid of his victims, merely people of whom he just needs to make them disappear, such as a business acquaintance he truly dislikes (played by Jared Leto) or a poor homeless. If he feels something we'll never know, he hides deep down inside.Bale is such a good actor for this part that comes as a shock to know that he wasn't the first choice for the role. Thankfully, many obstacles in the way of making it made it possible to him take this role which people said to him ""It will kill your career!"". It turns out to be not only one of his most notorious roles but also the one that reinvented him to Hollywood, a completely 180 degree turn up of his most recognizable role to that date as Jim in ""Empire of the Sun"". The character he plays here is vain, brutal, calculist, deeply impressed by the mass culture of the period he lives but completely apathetic and careless on the people of and out of his circle. He exteriorizes many expressions but down in the core we know he can't feel anything. That's why he does what he does (if he ever did). To make a relevant comparison, the performance of the actor and his character reminded of Eric Packer, played by Robert Pattinson in ""Cosmopolis"", one of the most debated films of the last years. Hard to reach a good consensus on it because his character resembles a lot Patrick Bateman but the performance of the actor leaves us confused, there's difference in the situations he lives and the one he faces through the whole journey. Of all the film adaptations based on Bret Easton Ellis novels this is truly the greatest one. Mary Harron made a hard effort in making this looks like the 1980's (""The Informers"" is so poor in this aspect), quite a nostalgic time travel in between musics and references, a truthful portrayal of the yuppie generation as never shown before in so many details, yet it reveals so much about every vain and blind generations that came after in the 1990's and the 2000's. Perhaps that's the reason why people identifies with this movie so much, even after years of its release. Harron also got it right with the casting - Willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas, Chlöe Sevigny, Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux, Matt Ross, Guinevere Turner (who also wrote the script) all in positive performances. Disturbingly funny, the movie and its main character are powerfully iconic just as Alex DeLarge in ""A Clockwork Orange"", both easily misinterpreted by a vast majority of its viewers. Bateman's tirades are priceless whether discussing Huey Lewis & The News musical qualities before killing one of his victims or his repeated line about having to return some videotapes. Like he says ""he's just a happy camper!"" 10/10","

The plot was all over the place, the violence went for shock factor rather than relevance, the romantic' scenes were like a bad B Grade movie, the attempted twist at the end was uninteresting, the acting  well I'm not sure there is a category to describe that!If you are thinking of seeing or hiring this movie my advice is don't waste your time or money.I have never given a zero for a movie ever before.

"xvfyi","7 April 2023","Their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip To Be Square"". A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself.","

"jasoncrespo-56276","8 August 2023","Interesting film, my first time watching I did not know what to expect and I ended up believing it to be a dark humor film, i rewatched it again later with my friend Jayden, and I started to pick up on some of the hidden meanings within the dialogue and scenes.This movie was meant to have a more ambiguous ending like the book it was based off of. The movie is about yuppie culture, an identity crisis, and a yearning for individuality in a world where everyone is superficial.I think the movie was pretty well made, and there are some iconic scenes within this movie that people will recognize right away without fail. Very popular.In the end Patrick Bateman loses because he is so dependent on others recognition that he's back to where he started, completely lost in reality, all the murders and crimes he committed may as well be fantasy because he has lost his mind and can't confirm anything that has happened without someone else confirming it for him. Won't say much more regarding details but I will say the execution is very good.Christian Bale does a really good job portraying Patrick Bateman. Perfect casting.","

"chrischanwasframed","30 October 2022","Christian Bale is a great actor who has been in a lot of great movies, but to me this will always be his best performance. Patrick Bateman is a terrible human being, but he is also fascinating. This film is probably not for everyone, they get too hung up on all of murder and blood. Which is fine, but if you can get past that, it is actually one of the best black comedies ever made, and I don't mean basketball black. The characters are all complete psychopaths, but that is why it is so funny. I think it rips Wall Street to shreds in the same way Zoolander ripped the modelling world apart. I haven't seen the film in years, but rewatching it, it definitely still holds up, it is just one classic scene after another. So many good memes. They don't make films like this anymore.","

"dillylamar","24 June 2020","American Psycho is a 2000 film directed by Mary Harron, adapted for the screen by Mary Harron, and based off of the novel of the same name. This film is a cult classic, as it's dark humor, ridiculousness, bloody violence, horror film traits, and insanely quotable moments mix well with its satire and criqie of collective identity, individuality consumerism, capitalism, and yuppie culture. Bale's breakout performance in the film is absolutely phenomenal and iconic. The main themes of the film are lack of individuality, collective identity becoming personal identity, the greed and self indulgence of those in high society, and what a psychopath can get away with in a world like this. All of the men on Wall street look and act the exact same. They are interchangeable, as are the women. That's why people constantly get names mixed up in the film, and that ends up saving Bateman. Bateman only cares about other view him. He is in a constant hunger for conformity and to be seen as better, as he ends up killing Paul Allen because he had a better business card than him. He has been killing for a long time, and has been able to maintain, but starts to breakdown. The film is about how we form a collective identity, pretty much losing our individuality and personal identity. We crave attention, material wealth, conformity and to be seen as better. Bateman does. So do the others. At the end of the film he realizes that nothing including himself really matter, everyone is the same. He is so indulged in a collective identity, that his lawyer mistakes him for someone else, obliterating his confession. No one cares that he kills people, no one even notices. He can get away with anything, even if your a serial killer/psychopath. because he has sold himself a collective identity. He puts value into material things like restaurants, suits, watches, cards, and apartments. He listens to cheesy pop music because its trendy, but much more value into it, than it really holds. He views the homeless and lower classes to be less than him, he just kills them. In this type of high society, the people lose their individuality and distungishable traits, and just become greedy, power hungry, emotionless, interchangeable and unoticable nothings. The only difference between Bateman and his banker colleagues, is that he kills people. But everyone is so wrapped up in themselves and collective identity, that they dont notice. Bateman sees women as meat or objects, and men as something to be better than.At the end of the film, after his breakdown, Bateman realize that he and everyone else he knows is meaningless, interchangeable, and that he can get away with anything. He can Indulge in his murderous hunger all he wants. He presents himself in the collective identity, fitting in losing all sense of self. It will go on. He becomes more and more hungry and uncontrollable and his private life becomes integrated into his professional, and he realizes that he take it, and get away with it, there is more to take. Don' become a Patrick Bateman. He craves to stand out and be better. His view of himself is skewed by his psychosis, inflated ego and sociopatheology. His fantasy and reality become jaded, mixed, and goes insane because he can't really tell the difference. His killings all happend, but some are partial truths, or over aesthetically elaborate type chainsaw massacre killings. He so disconnected and detached from reality.","

"bregund","23 February 2003","This review contains spoilers.This movie doesn't know what it wants to be.  It's too serious to be a black comedy, too gruesome to be a comedy, too funny to be a drama, too narrow-mined to be satirical, and too broad to be a character study.  In short, American Psycho takes the middle road so often that the end result is a weak, ineffectual film that promises more than it delivers.Just in case you don't know that this film takes place in greed-driven 1980s (oh right, like the 1990s internet explosion had nothing to do with greed), gigantic cordless phones, 1980s music, power suits, whitewashed Malibu walls, and odd menu choices like `sea urchin ceviche' are jammed into your senses.  With all of these blatant era-placement devices, you just know that during the writing of the script someone must have quipped about `instant culture immersion via baseball bat.'  I'm surprised they didn't stick a Neiman poster on the wall.  By the way, why aren't any of the women actors wearing those huge shoulder pads that were so popular in the 1980s? 
Christian Bale, as the yuppie Patrick Bateman, is pretty good in this otherwise vapid film.  The men are broadly-painted cliches of the typical 1980s ivy-league archetype:  snotty and oily-haired, with mannerisms akin to those of car salesmen or insurance agents, engaged in a culture of their own that we as viewers are supposed to ridicule, not just because it is the 1980s but because they were born priveleged, have nicknames like `Biff', and will someday die not in a smelly hospital but in the comfort of their own home on a four-hundred-year-old poster bed attended to by a private nurse.Several things don't make sense:  when the prostitute ran screaming down the hall, pounding on doors, why didn't any of the residents open their doors? Why don't we ever see Bateman doing any work instead of just listening to music or going to lunch?  How could you kill someone with a nail gun?  And just what happened at the end, was Paul Allen alive or dead?  I don't understand this film at all.This film is as pretty and sterile as Patrick Bateman's condo, and, like much of the 1980s, offers little substance.","

"Jeremy_Urquhart","23 July 2022","Revisited this for the first time in many years. It's always been a film I've liked without quite loving, but my appreciation for it's grown, and I like it more now than I remember. Of course, watching it in 2022 vs 2011, there are now so many (mostly ironic) memes surrounding the movie than there used to be, so you have to try and put them out of your mind as much as you can, otherwise it's hard to take any of it seriously.Not that it should all be taken seriously of course. I think American Psycho works best if you treat it as an extremely dark comedy over anything else, as it's the satirical elements that work the strongest. It does get funnier and more biting as a satire if you believe most of the murders are fantasy. On previous viewings, I thought the majority weren't imagined, but now I reckon most of them are. And the point of the movie is likely ultimately that even if Bateman never literally killed anyone, he's still an ""American psycho"" and all that either way.What's always been great about this movie is Christian Bale, of course, and it might be his career best performance. It's also a very entertaining movie, and despite not having a traditional, concrete plot, it's paced well and always feels like it's going somewhere. I will say, regardless of what you believe to be real or imagined, I think it ends a little suddenly, and it's a shame Willem Dafoe doesn't have a final scene towards the end (it feels a bit jarring), but overall, still a strong movie, and a deserved cult classic.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to return some videotapes.","

"jaredmobarak","2 August 2008","Oh, the 1980's, such happy times. Excess in full force, younger upstart yuppies making money that they could only imagine as children while doing as little work as possible. When did going to lunch, out to dinner at restaurants booked for months in advance, and vying for the biggest ego constitute an occupation worth six figures? Only in America. Bret Easton Ellis' novel was looked upon as very demeaning to women in its portrayal of these masochistic males using their girls as trophies and toys, so who better to adapt and direct a feature of American Psycho than a woman such as Mary Harron. Her film version is a satire on society's fall to materialism and conformity, showing how along with the money and power comes a way of life that is unavoidable. Our lead, Patrick Bateman at one point tells his girlfriend that he is trying to fit in. He is catering to the image of masculinity and success despite his urges to break free into his own lifestyle of gratuitous sex and violence. He says early on that Patrick Bateman doesn't exist, he is an empty face hiding the darkness underneath, the scheming and desire to live on the fringe of society and be able to get away with it amongst the self-absorbed snobs running around blind to anything but themselves.The story hinges on the devolution of humanity for Bateman as the vapid existence he lives becomes too much to handle. Everything in his world is superficial, from his girlfriend, to his lithium-using mistress, to his meaningless job and his need to look and live better than his peers. One of the best scenes comes from a comparison of business cards and whose is more subtly beautiful due to the whiteness of stock and uniqueness of font. Each card is identical to the layperson, but to these men, obsessed with appearances, they couldn't be more different and inferior. It is such a cookie-cutter lifestyle that no one even knows whom each other is. They will call ""friends"" by the wrong name and then proceed to talk about how much of a reject the person they are actually speaking to is, unknowing they are insulting them to their face. It is one thing to allow the mistakes to happen, it's another to revel in it and pretend to be that other person, because really, what is the difference? Both wear the same suits, have an affinity for the same glasses, and get their hair cut at the same salon.Because of this duality in identity, Bateman is given a carte blanche to live out his dark fantasies at night. If people think he is someone else when he is raping and murdering people, he is able to live without risk of being caught. Heck, he doesn't even need an alibi because his friends are 100% positive he was out with them the night he was committing heinous crimes. Between the drugs and carbon copy personas, no one knows who they are let alone who they are with. Therefore, Bateman can do whatever he wants, and does. He lives in his own world, waxing pontifically about asinine drivel before going in for the kill.I don't think anyone could have pulled this role off besides Christian Bale. His demeanor is so likable that no one would think twice about feeling safe with him. As a model he meets and later dispatches says, ""there is something good about you."" Even when in rage, he retains his smile and jovial attitude, praising Phil Collins' talent for bringing Genesis out of their arty funk and Whitney Houston for four of the greatest songs ever written on her album appropriately titled Whitney Houston. The way his delivery makes the most benign topics jump out at you is amazing and when the blood splatters onto his face, you can't help but laugh through the carnage. No other film will make you see the humor in serial killing for sport. All Bateman does is what we fantasize about everyday, breaking free from the monotony and acting on our impulses to punish the stupid and the weak. As he tells a homeless man before killing him, ""why don't you get a job?"" It's the man's negative attitude and laziness that prevents him from succeeding in life. This is a time of self-pride and preservation, albeit an excess of said pride, that allows everyone to look at themselves as God. Even a diatribe about the troubles in South Africa and the US with poverty comes off as staged and humorous. Not because Bateman feels these subject are more relevant than Sri Lanka, but because he really doesn't care about any of it.Shot beautifully with many static frames focusing on the person's face in action rather than the activity happening around them, American Psycho is gorgeous to behold. The stark sanitation of everything: clean apartments, pristine bodies, and impeccable dressing style counters lovely with the chaos that Bateman brings from his bloodlust.It is Leto's disappearance that lends to the fact of whether what we see actually happens. Did Bateman kill him and continue with his atrocities afterwards or did Leto really go to London, where people had lunch with him, and the murder was just imagination? No one can ever really know since no character ever knows whom it is they are talking to. Perhaps those who saw Leto really saw others who pretended to be him mistakenly, or maybe he was there still alive and breathing. This is the confusion with insanity and chaos, one can't tell the difference between truth and fiction; the line blurs to infinity. American Psycho could be a tale of the psyche or a story of murderous rage left unchecked, it's really up to you to decide.","

"uhudsavascisi","18 August 2023","American Psycho is a film directed by Mary Harron and adapted from Bret Easton Ellis's novel of the same name. While critiquing the shallow consumer culture of the 1980s, the film unveils the inner world of its main character, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale). Patrick appears as a typical white-collar investment banker in New York, masking his true nature as a psychopathic serial killer.The film sharply criticizes the emptiness behind the flashy and luxurious lifestyle, the superficiality of human relationships, and Bateman's disconnected state from reality. Beneath Patrick's flawless appearance lies a lack of empathy and emotional insensitivity towards others. His perverse inner world is expressed through gruesome murders and deranged rituals.The film engages viewers in a profound contemplation as they attempt to comprehend Bateman's madness and the dark side beneath his seemingly normal life. The camera closely follows Bateman's mental breakdown, often blurring the line between reality and hallucination. Bale's acting effectively portrays the character's internal conflicts alongside his cold-blooded murders.American Psycho serves as a sharp critique of the corrupted reflection of the American Dream, targeting the frenzy of consumerism and the loss of humanity. Through visual and symbolic storytelling techniques, the film presents Bateman's complex mind, filled with psychopathic thoughts and impulses, delivering an unsettling experience to the audience. Harron's directorial skills combined with Ellis's story create an extraordinary psychological thriller.In conclusion, American Psycho is a striking film that exposes the dark truths beneath the surface of shallow living and the conflicts within an individual's psyche. Patrick Bateman's madness and the decay of society serve as a mirror, provoking thought and shaking viewers by reflecting the depraved aspects of the modern world.","

"Reviews_of_the_Dead","12 December 2019","This film I originally saw in college when one of my buddies put it on. I had no idea what it was and was just shocked with what I saw in such a good way. I think I've seen it a few times now and just now fully starting to understand it all. I had some theories, but it really took listening to others thoughts as well as those who have read the book for me to think I finally get everything. The synopsis is a wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), hides his alternative psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonist fantasies.As it states, we follow Patrick who we never actually see do any work. He is engaged to marry Evelyn Williams (Reese Witherspoon), but he doesn't love her. He actually has no emotion, as he states himself. He admits to really just going through the motions of trying to be human, but aside from flesh, blood and looking that way, he doesn't feel emotion aside from disgust and greed.He has a close group of friends of Timothy Bryce (Justin Theroux), who Bale believes is sleeping with his fiancé. They also hang out the most together, doing a lot of drinking and drugs. There's also Craig McDermott (Josh Lucas) as well as David Van Patten (Bill Sage). They all work together at the same firm. Another guy they work with is Luis Carruthers (Matt Ross). He is odd and he is engaged to marry Courtney Rawlinson (Samantha Mathis). She is having an affair with Patrick though. This group of people goes out to eat all the time at fancy restaurants, drink and do drugs, living a rich lifestyle, but all of them are out of touch with reality. The four men who hang out together are sexist and definitely pretentious.Patrick tells us he's losing the mask of sanity. What doesn't help is his encounters with Paul Allen (Jared Leto). The first is that we get an odd measuring of ego by comparing business cards. Patrick then goes out to dinner with Paul, but he thinks that Patrick is actually someone else the whole time. It takes a dark turn when Patrick kills him with an ax.This brings him into contact with Donald Kimball (Willem Dafoe), a detective who is looking into the disappearance of Paul. Patrick is becoming more and more unhinged and has less control over his actions. The issue becomes though, who is Patrick Bateman and are what we seeing real or just in the mind of a psychopath?As I've said now that I've seen this film a few times, I can see some interesting things that this film is addressing. The first is I've heard some people contend this is not a horror film. I most definitely feel that this falls into that category. We first have a psychopath that is on the edge of sanity that is going around killing people. Not all of this is done on screen, but it just has that dark feel about it. Seeing Patrick as he slips into madness is really something that is enjoyable.From here I want to shift to the interesting idea that all of these male characters are pretty much the same person. Of course, they're not. We can see that each one of them is different, but none of them really have an identity. This last viewing was in the theater with my girlfriend and she pointed out that they all look the same. They all want to do the same exact things and it is really just showing they are a stereotype of these people from the 1980's and really have no personal thing to set them apart.That moves to the point where since they're all so similar, no one can tell each other apart. Of course Patrick, Timothy, Craig and David all know each other, but Paul thinks that Patrick is someone else. Patrick talks to his lawyer at the end and thinks he's someone else and even thinks he went out to dinner with Paul. To take it farther, they're all sleeping with each other's fiancés and none of them seem to care about that either. They're just maintaining a lifestyle that they think they should. The final thing about them is that they're horribly pretentious as well as misogynistic.I want to shift to this to the acting and going to have just a paragraph here dedicated to Bale. His performance here is unreal. I like that he does so well at showing at first how much of a sociopath that Patrick is. It is a lot like watching the show Dexter that came out after this, in that they both know they're really just doing what they can to get by. Seeing Patrick as the more he kills, the more he loses control. But in the end, we don't know if what he's done actually happened or not. I'm going to have a spoiler section at the bottom as to what I think happens here.As for the rest of the acting, I think that Theroux, Lucas and Sage are all solid. They do well at pretty much mirroring each other which I dug. Chloë Sevigny has an interesting role as Jean, Patrick's secretary. She is attracted to him, which is fitting since she's into men who are available and just wants to be part of this world. Witherspoon and Mathias are also mirrors of each other which works. I have to a lot of credit to Dafoe, he's so good here. I love that his scenes were filmed with three different expressions of Kimball thinking Patrick didn't, thinking he's innocent and one of just not knowing, then just splicing them in to just make Patrick seem that unnerved when trying to read him. Ross, Leto and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.That will shift me to the pacing of this film, which I think is good. It has a run time of around 100 minutes and to be honest, it doesn't feel like it. We just move through this descent into madness as it gets worse and worse. Seeing that no one around him really knows him makes it that much worse. Much like his descent, his acts of violence get progressively more aggressive as well. I really dig the ending and the implications of everything that we get there. It is both terrifying and kind of sickening as well.The effects are really good. This isn't necessarily a gory film as a lot of what happens is off screen. What we do get though is blood that looks pretty real. We get to see some bodies, but only for a glimpse which works. The tension is built through seeing the build up and just how Patrick has no real touch with reality. It is shot very well to convey this also.The last thing to cover here would the soundtrack. I love that Patrick is a connoisseur of music from the era. It seems out of place with the things that he's into, but he has dissected it in such a way that it is surgical. How he describes these songs before he commits violent acts is wonderful in bringing not only horror, but dread as well. I think that the score fits for what they needed for sure.Now with that said, the more I see this film, the more I appreciate it. There's such a great character study of someone who seems to have it all, but has no touch with reality. Bale's acting in bringing Patrick to life is wonderful. He's accompanied by a solid cast as well. It is paced in a way where I don't find it boring and the ending is just great. The effects are really good, even though we necessarily don't get a lot. The soundtrack fits for what was needed. This is a film that really does benefit from multiple watches to really piece together everything that we are seeing here. This definitely a film I find to be great for sure. I would recommend to horror and non-horror fans alike to give this one a viewing for sure.My Rating: 10 out of 10SPOILERS:Now what do I think happened. I think that Patrick murdered Paul as well as some of the other girls that he brought home including Christie (Cara Seymour) as well as Elizabeth (Guinevere Turner). I do believe the homeless man we see early on was murdered as well. Kimball is coming around to investigate the murder. I think though that the rampage Patrick goes on late in the film isn't really happening. He thinks he kills all those people, but he's just panicking and ends up back at his office. What works in his favor is that no one really knows anyone else, so his lawyer really does think he's someone else much like Paul thought he was someone else. I do think there really are murders is when they're showing Paul's apartment, the lady there has a look of dread and tells him to leave. Since it is an expensive place, they're covering it up as well. Patrick is going to get away with it for now since no one really knows who he is, including himself.","

"jessicalpeter","11 January 2019","Christian Bale's acting was very good, and the rest was just boring. If you want to watch a yuppie sociopath monologuing for an hour + (and sometimes killing folks), it's the perfect movie. Unfortunately I found it remarkably dull. With a confusing vague ending to cap it off, this will not go down as one of my favourites","

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","29 September 2008","Welcome to the mind of Patrick Bateman: Wall Street broker, fine diner, playboy, oh and serial killer extroadinare. Bateman claims only part of himself is based in humanity and similarly, only part of this film is based on reason or sanity.""American Psycho"" is easily one of the top five most deranged films of all time. Those with a taste for the bizarre and an interest in the abstraction of realism will find it great, those who prefer movies grounded in, well, something, will at the very least be amused by the perverse nature of the plot and Bateman's psychotic character.Christian Bale does some pretty great work with Bateman, giving us a very dissociative identity look to the clearly insane killer, showing him as very cold and crafty while also emotional and irrational. His character jumps all over the place and Bale really has the look and skills to play all those kinds of characters.I have to say that while I like Mary Harron's visual choices with the film, overall I don't know if we got deep enough into the meddle that is this plot and the cavernous mind of Bateman. The thin line between reality/imagination, sanity/insanity is very clear, but the social commentary is sort of overshadowed by the film's taste for the absurd. I definitely think there's richness, but there is a lot of thickness too.I suppose if you come at this film with a more abstract perspective than a desire to sort things out and make sense of them, you'll find more things to enjoy about the film other than Bateman's philosophical conversations about sellout recording artists while he indulges in one fantasy or another. It's strange, and while strange is good, strange also needs to be handled a bit more thoughtfully than in ""Psycho.""","

"morfeus","11 December 2006","Do you like Mary Harron?Her early work was a little too TV for my taste, but when ""I Shot Andy Warhol"" came out in '96, I think she really came into her own, commercially and artistically. In 2000, Mary Harron released ""American Psycho"", her most accomplished movie. The whole movie has a clear crisp '80s look, and a new sheen of social satire, which really gives the movie a big boost. In terms of writing craftsmanship, the sheer scriptwriting, this movie hits a new peak of professionalism. The movie is so catchy, most people don't even try to understand the meaning, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, importance of trends, hollow yuppie lifestyle and murders, but it's also a personal statement of a director herself!Do you like Christian Bale?I've been a big Bale fan since the release of his '94 movie ""Prince of Jutland"". Before that, I really didn't understand any of his work. Too artsy, too intellectual. It was on ""Prince of Jutland"" where Christian Bale's presence became more apparent. I think ""American Psycho"" is Bale's undisputed masterpiece. It's an epic meditation on intangibility. At the same time, it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding movies. His acting is as positive and affirmative as anything I've seen in any movie. The brilliant ensemble of other actors makes ""American Psycho"" great,great movie, a personal favourite. You can practically sense the empathy between Bale, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, Jared Leto, Reese Witherspoon and Samantha Mathis.So, to sum up, the movie is extremely uplifting, it shines with hope that it's not too late to better ourselves, and contains a crucial message - since it's impossible in this world we live in, to empathise with others, we always empathise with ourselves. It's beautifully stated in the movie. And now excuse me, I have to return some videotapes.","

"freemantle_uk","24 January 2010","American Psycho was based on a successful novel, which led to being a film with a cult following. It is the most successful film of Mary Harron's career, and Christian Bale's first lead role as an adult actor.Patrick Bateman (Christain Bale), is a very rich, successful 27-year-old man working for a major Wall Street investment company. He lives in a nice apartment in the Big Apple, physically very fit, hansom, has a organized routine, and is completely insane. He lives the high live of an executive, fancy restaurants, beautiful women, recreational drugs, etc... There is an even darker side to his world, involving affairs, prostitution and of course very violence murder. His blood lust starts to increase and can't content himself. He murders tramps and prostitutes, he suffers from extreme anger and envy. He murders Paul Allen (Jared Leto), another successful young man: his disappearance is investigated Detective Kimball (Willem Dafoe). Patrick's mind starts to decline.This film is more surreal then I expected. It reminded very much of A Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver, both classics, but looking at the upper end of society, not the working class. It does show a man who mind does break down and his looking for an identity in a hollow world. It is a satire of the high-powered 80s New York. It has a strange dark humour in places that works.Of course this film has a great cast. This is the film that made Bale's adult career. He has a great performance as a psychopath and shows his talent. I particularly enjoyed the scene when he murders Paul Allen where he was like Jim Carrey. Jared Leto only has a small role but is good as he normally is. So was Cara Seymour as a prostitute who is brought into Patrick's corrupted world.Harron directs a very violence, but this isn't torture porn like Hostel or the Saw films. There is reason behind it, and she only shows what she has to. She shows that she has a competent hand behind the camera and a decent art-house director. She handles the mix between reality and fantasy, leaving the film to be very ambiguous.A decent watch.","

I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I'll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.","

I almost forgot- It also has one of the best acting performances of the year from Christian Bale. This dark, but yet, brilliant film is about an 80's yuppie who moonlights as a disturbed serial killer. Bale's star-breaking performance should ring bells to oscar voters when they decide the best actor nominees. Director Mary Harron's  unique style of craftsmanship was right-on. Also, you will not hear a more creative screenplay in a film this year  especially in the scenes when Bale's character is describing his version of 80's musicians societal insights as he is nonchalantly murdering and seducing his preys. The `hip to be square' scene is one of the best of the year- so spread the news. Hopefully, I have said enough to have `psyched' you up to go watch this flawless film. ***** Excellent","

"questl-18592","13 November 2019","This is one of those movies that I feel like hits me differently every time I watch it. As someone who just graduated to a proper adult career, watching this exec's spiral into corporate madness feels oddly surreal. The comparison over the business cards, the decision on a restaurant. I feel like my office is going to break out into a heated ""who has the best pen"" discussion any day now.Obviously, this is all dialed up to the Nth degree in American Psycho and I love it for that. I also love the way it plays with ambiguity so much. Any movie that can effectively leave me questioning what was real and what wasn't is going to get some points and this succeeds in that so well.","

The whole movie has a clear, crisp plot, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the story a big boost. He's been compared to Ted Bundy, but I think Patrick has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. Towards the end the producers released this; The chainsaw scene!, their most crazy scene. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Paul Allen's murder"". A dialog so sinister, most people probably don't listen to what he's saying . But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about Patrick itself. Hey Paul!","

"aidanratesmovies","7 November 2019","Fit with a well executed script, masterful directing, and a wild sense of entertainment, American Psycho is truly a one of a kind work that is bound to be a thought provoking classic. Christian Bale as Patrick Bateman is one of the best performances of the decade, and far deserving of the Oscar he didn't even get a nomination for. The story is well executed, and by far well written with a tight sense of atmosphere and direction that perfectly builds on suspense and tension in more interesting ways than one. The film does seem to struggle to find a conclusion, but provides some interesting commentary on society and the business world in general, that is by far thought-provoking. In the end, however, the film is uniquely different in more ways than one. It's tight and uncomfortable atmosphere and interesting and provocative script make for not only an enjoyable movie but one you won't easily forget.

"noralee","12 December 2005","Seeing ""American Psycho"" right after ""High Fidelity"" is like going through a fun-house mirror, as it's a warped, caustic view of many of the same issues ""HF"" deals with humorously and with humanity. The monologues on pop music are disarmingly similar, but here they are just foreplay for uncontrollable hate and blood lust as a way to try to poke through them for feeling, as if it's ripping through Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"" video for blood.I have no idea about what the original book is like, but this is a ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" of the single '80's set. One weakness is that we don't actually see the interchangeable yuppies work so we don't see the testosterone rush at work that is so frightening in ""Boiler Room"" and would have added more tension and maybe even explanation here, where all we hear is that ""Mergers & Acquisitions"" is synonymous for the lead character to ""murders and executions."" They are all so interchangeable (shades of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" taking over Jude Law's character) that I was really not sure of what is real or fantasy when others keep saying that he must be mistaken about murdering a co-worker when they met with him.The lead character, played beautifully narcissistically by Christian Bale, is equally murdering men and women here, so the misogyny charges filed against the book don't apply here, and he's equally unfeeling to both. But as he breaks down, the irony is that he's not unfeeling about his crimes--the rest of the people around him are.It's a very funny, very visually appealing and horrific commentary.(originally written 4/15/2000)","

"spinin","16 April 2000","""American Psycho"" focuses on the excessiveness of the business lifestyle of the late 80s. It is an interesting exaggeration on several levels. Because it is such an over the top story, it is a good comedy and a good movie.Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a typical businessman on wall street. He is a rich yuppie stud with an apartment that looks more like an art work. His daily morning activities include lengthy showers and healthy work outs. Patrick uses at least four or five various soaps and lotions to keep his skin smooth and perfect. His main area of focus is his handsome face. Patrick is also very fit since he tells us that he is able to do 1000 crunches every day. He dresses in fancy suits and goes to work, where we hardly see him do anything different than watch TV or listen to music. His favorite activity is going to expensive restaurants and having cynical conversations about business related topics. His friends are not much different looking than him. In fact, Patrick is mistaken for another man from his company on more than one occasion. This is no coincidence. The person continues to address him incorrectly, believing he is speaking to someone else. Patrick also has a girlfriend played by Reese Witherspoon. He hardly pays any attention to her. He prefers to listen to his walkman. Finally, whenever he finds the time, Patrick is a psychopathic serial killer.""American Psycho"" is very stylish and very well directed by Mary Harron. She creates simple and perfect surroundings appropriate for a man so concerned with his looks. Christian Bale plays the obsessive businessman very well. He gives the film the additional mechanical feel. Everything he seems to say is such a package. Nothing seems human, but rather an excessive and unnatural pose. He talks like an ad for restaurants and like a review of his favorite albums. Nothing seems to separate him from his friends, except for his dark secret. He takes pleasure in killing. And this seems very mechanical as well. Why does he do it? Why does he do anything?There are some great scenes in ""American Psycho."" One of them is the shower scene described above. Another excellent scene takes place in an office where Patrick and his friends are comparing business cards. They all carry them around in special metal cases as if they were worth a fortune. As they show them to each other, the cards seem exactly the same. Yet this is a tense scene. The subtle differences (the color of one card is described as ""egg shell"") create competition. Patrick shows signs of his paranoia as he realizes that his card is not the best one. There is also another good appearance by Jared Leto, who essentially serves the same purpose here as he did in ""Fight Club."" In my opinion, he is perfect for the role.And so, Patrick Bateman kills people. It has been criticized that the movie is pointless and there is no motive for all the murders. It doesn't matter. ""American Psycho"" is a SATIRE. The murders are funny, not always, but often. Patrick bateman is confused himself. He is having an identity crisis. This is the only thing that separates him from anyone else. The murders are an exaggeration just like the rest of his life.""American Psycho"" is a good film that lags at certain times. However, Chirtian Bale gives a great performance in a movie that is very attractive in its mechanical nature. It is such an exaggeration that it cannot be taken seriously like other serial killer movies. This is a comedy that looks good and works well. Overall, an 8 out of 10.","

"alice liddell","7 June 2000","If you were to make a satire of the American 80s, that infamous, hollow, bombastic, ultra-materialist, cruel decade, how would you do it?  Would you have a male hero, in this decade of Rambo, Arnie and Gordon Gekko, where even women wanted to be men?  Would you fetishise minimalism - elaborately tiny meals; shiny apartments with hardly any furniture etc. - to emphasise the spiritual emptiness of the decade?  Would you foreground the most ghastly, soulless, manufactured music to demonstrate the assembly-line reduction of emotions?  Would you mock the obsession with restaurants, big suits, vanity products, the mimicking of a 20s aristocracy sieved of all Gatsbyesque romance; where new, utility products don't make life easier, but serve to alienate you further from you 'loved' ones, your peers, your surroundings?  Would you show how, beneath the civilised sheen, the most barbaric ritual rites retain (and I'm not just talking about the serial killing)?  Would your hero be so obsessed with appearance, image (lots of mirrors and reflections), fitting in, that he would cease to be himself, that he would be alienated from himself, that he would become a literal double of himself with nothing inside?  Would you show the abuse of marginal figures such as the homeless?  Would you compare all this to the obscenities of the Reagan era?Sounds easy, doesn't it?  And that, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, is the problem with AMERICAN PSYCHO - it goes for the easy option every time.  It is no excuse to argue that the film is thin and superficial, that its satire is far too broad, because so was the decade.  By making this American psycho so ridiculous, so harmlessly, buffoonishly camp; by making the kind of emasculated satirical swipes a Republican might enjoy; only evades the true moral decadence of the era.The device of suggesting that everything that Bateman does is a mere projection of his fantasies, in the way the whole decade was a paralysing projection of materialist fantasies, goes back at least as far as LAURA, but whereas that classic tried to deconstruct the image of the police detective, and the very real authority invested in him, Bateman is just a dork, as everyone says.  He is too silly to be scary, his social position isn't adequately delineated to make him powerful.This in itself is satirical - what DOES Bateman do to make so much money? Is he really daddy's boy, or just another wannabe vice-president among dozens?  Why does he pick his particular victims?  In Paul Allen's case it's clear enough, immature envy.  But why prostitutes and the homeless (echoes of Bunuel, Kubrick, Ferrera)?  Because they refuse to conform to the glorious 80s ethic, they don't want to fit in like he does, they give the lie to his era's self-confidence?  Because they exist on the margin, as he would truly like to?  But he is as 'unproductive' and marginal as they are. Donald Kimball is set up as some kind of doppelganger (the film seems very indebted to Poe; or is this a nod to 80s academic theory?), but this kind of disintegrates as the plot breaks down, presumably to mirror its protagonists increasing madness.The style is as anonymous as its subject - again, correspondence between form and content isn't really enough; CLAIRE DOLAN has shown how the evocation of a soulless environment can be made critically meaningful. The lack of budget deadens the impact of the action hero climax.  If the film has a saving grace, it is the performance of Christian Bale, effecting, for some reason, an excellent impression of Jim Carrey, doing what he can to wring laughs from the predictable material (the BEN-HUR-like threesome is hilarious).  I watched DRILLER KILLER after this, a real American psycho whose trauma is rooted in an emotional crisis Bateman can never have because he is, as he says, a cipher.","

You have this successful guy with money, a nice girlfriend, lots of friends and lots of pressure he can't bear and for compensation he just walks around, killing homeless people, prostitutes and friends. This was the one movie in a long time I was really upset about; don't get me wrong, I love films like the Scream-Trilogy or The Matrix, films with a lot of blood and violence, but ""American Psycho"" uses violence only for the sake of violence itself, to satisfy the audience's voyeuristic bloodlust. And, who would really believe one could shot a couple of policemen, an old lady and several other people in one night without further notice? Sounds more like some kind of tasteless comedy than a movie that wants to be taken seriously.","

While much of it was overwritten, particularly the gore parts, within it was a biting yet chilling satire, from the concentration of what Patrick wore to what he listened to(the record reviews, written with the same depth as one might expect a review of The Who's TOMMY would have, are hysterical), which exposed an entire empty sub-culture.  I'm glad director and co-writer(with Guinevere Turner, who also plays one of Patrick's victims) Mary Harron found that satire in her film, while playing down the gore(though the murders still retain their kick).  One could argue some of it is so 80's it's passe, but then again, given the way a new generation of people are driven to success at any cost, maybe it's not just the 80's.Bale does a good job of capturing Patrick, being both funny and terrifying, often at the same time, and yet showing that the person he most terrifies is himself.  The other actors are all good, particularly Chloe Sevigny as Patrick's secretary, and makes it believable that she's the one person he would spare.  A couple of points on what people have written; if the other characters seem shallow, that's partly because that's how Patrick sees them. Also, I don't think we're supposed to think he imagined it all; I think his friends just don't believe a serial killer may be in their midst(which is why Harron keeps Ellis' last line ""THIS IS NOT AN EXIT"" on the door behind Patrick).","

"centropolis","30 July 2000","This is truly awesome. I loved everything about this movie, although, it was not the book, it was still a terrific movie. Director Mary Harron left out appropriate things, such as the rat incident. This movie is terrificly made. Allthough, many of you pansies out there might not like the tone, you don't look at the many positive things about this movie. Decide for yourself. I however, loved Christian Bale, and I wish Willem Dafoe would make more movies. P.S. The nail-gun scene is HILARIOUS.","

"SweetTooth4MnMs","25 February 2003","This was a wicked movie. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. Christian Bale played a very convincing psycho. I loved his evil stares and the way his mouth was always formed into a straight line. I watched the TV version on TBS so I didn't see that much violence and gore but I saw enough to know what was going on. I didn't quite fully understand what his motive was for killing but I could tell that just about everyone he killed was annoying and he really couldn't stand them. I thought he he did a good job of not letting everyone know about the murders and keeping them a secret. Patrick Bateman was very scary at times. Especially when he was chasing the girl with the chainsaw and he was covered in blood. I really don't have a whole lot to say about ""American Psycho"" except that I thought it was a great horror movie and that the ending could've been better. But Christian Bale was very good in this one and his role was convincing. I recommend this one to anyone who likes this genre of movies. But I'm gonna go now and thanks for reading my review! Bye!","

"mcfly-31","10 March 2007","Over 800 comments, so I usually don't bother, but I must speak...This is one of the more ungodly stupid movies I've watched in a while. From Bale's first line-delivery where he seems to channel Jim Carrey, to all of the blathering murder sequences (with endlessly needless dissertations on 80s music), I was fidgeting pretty quick. Then it totally lost me minutes later when he inexplicably stabs a homeless man and stomps a small dog to death. And this after both encouraging the man and then telling him what a waste of life he is. An anti-hero if I've ever seen one. The entire tone of this film is insanely awkward, at times seeming to be a comedy dealing with a self-absorbed narcissist, who happens to sprinkle in blood-drenched murders here and there. No, I haven't read the book, and no, maybe I don't get the ""satirical"" approach others love. Either way, it was just jumbled garbage. Bale is a chameleon of sorts, sometimes resembling Cruise or Hart Bochner, but that unbearable, irritatingly pompous voice grated on me pretty quick. Only saving grace is some great 80s period atmosphere, right down to a keypad on an ATM machine with the BIG WHITE numbers. Other than that, cultists will be sure to keep this alive and well for years to come.","

"ibarix","31 January 2023","""American Psycho"" is a 2000 film directed by Mary Harron and based on the novel of the same name by Bret Easton Ellis. Starring Christian Bale in the lead role as Patrick Bateman, a successful Wall Street banker with a sinister double life, the film is a darkly satirical and disturbingly accurate portrayal of the excess and emptiness of the yuppie culture of the late 80s.The film's sharp social commentary on consumerism and materialism is one of its strongest aspects, with its characters' shallow obsession with appearances and material possessions serving as a metaphor for the moral decay of society. Bale's performance as Bateman is nothing short of mesmerizing, as he perfectly embodies the character's charming, yet disturbingly sadistic personality.In terms of cinematography, the film is stylish and visually stunning, with its sleek and modern aesthetic perfectly capturing the excess and emptiness of its characters' lives. The film's soundtrack also deserves special mention, with its use of popular 80s tracks adding an additional layer of commentary on the superficiality of the era.While the film's social commentary and stylish tone are major selling points, it must be noted that its graphic violence and explicit content may not be for everyone. The film's depiction of murder and mutilation is integral to the plot and commentary, but it may be too intense for some viewers. The film's unflinching and provocative nature is a testament to its impact and effectiveness, but it may also turn some audiences away.","

"ametaphysicalshark","19 July 2007","Patrick Bateman is 27 years old. He's rich, he works on Wall Street, and he's a psycho who likes to kill people. He isn't a person, or so he tells us. He can't feel any emotions, except for disgust and greed.There are several great scenes in the film. In one of them, Bateman argues that Phil Collins' ""In Too Deep"" is the most moving pop song of the 80's. He argues that Genesis pre-1980 were too artsy, and that Phil Collins' commercial attitude and solo career saved Genesis, made them a great band. He does this all while preparing two prostitutes for sex and with a single expression on his face. Just before he gets to 'work' he turns on ""Ssubio"", calling it a great, great song. Of course, this is all brilliant satire on 80's society. Patrick Bateman is boring and conformist, like everything else in that 'wonderful' decade, such a wild contrast to the revolutionary society of the 70's and 90's. It is little nuances like this that give me such a huge appreciation for the screenplay and. An understanding of 80's pop culture will greatly enhance your viewing experience because as relevant as this is to our world today, it is a period piece and though it is a vicious attack on human banality and our conformist ways, it uses the prime example of this (the 80's) as its way of getting its point across. Where else do you see a man hacking another to pieces set to the tune of Huey Lewis' ""Hip to Be Square""? That scene might just have the single greatest song choice I've seen in a film. Perfectly describing the banality of yuppie life in the 1980's and serving as the soundtrack for a vicious act of rather unnecessary violence, the scene is grotesque and almost scary, but still utterly brilliant and viciously funny. Another standout scene is near the end as Bateman blurts out a confession of his crimes to his lawyer through a phone message. In many ways it is the musical choices made by Mary Harron that accentuate the film's satire. Besides Bale's performance and the gorgeous photography, it is the soundtrack, packed with bland, soulless, empty pop music that pushes this film over the top. Some detractors call the film too violent, too over-the-top, too vile and disgusting. This is not true. Every single moment of the film is warranted. It is a vicious satire, never intended to be subtle.4.5/5","

"mjw2305","6 February 2006","Ever read the book? Hard work wasn't it? I don't mean this as an insult to 'Bret Easton Ellis' work, he simply had to use this intense attention to detail to deliver us the character of Bateman. So i for one was very pleased to find that this was carried over to film successfully (apart from the glaring omission of the violence and gore).Mary Harron, bravely chose to leave these scenes to suggestion, running the risk of reprisal from critics everywhere.Did Mary Harron chose correctly? I say absolutely yes! Given the relatively low budget of the film, the complexity of the story and the characters and the difficulty in displaying such harrowing and sick sexual and murderous visuals, 'American Psycho' could have quite easily become a very disjointed slasher movie, and thankfully it doesn't.Instead 'American Psycho' is a wonderfully satirical look at Yuppie life in the 80's, and the idea of living the dream at the expense of the soul. Christian Bale captures the character of Bateman with perfection, and he takes us on the decent into madness with him.Overall this is a faithful translation to the big screen, which is in many ways more entertaining than the book. My thanks to Mary Harron and Christian Bale for this achievement.8/10","

"FischerMax","24 January 2000","Although it takes an avid imagination to fully appreciate American Psycho, it is an excellent portrayal of image obsessed professionals in the mid 80s and what this lifestyle does to the mind of Patrick Bateman.Do not expect the gore ridden blood fest that this movie may seem to be. It is much more tame than the book and the emphasis is definitely not on this aspect of the film.American Psycho is definitely a BLACK comedy.  Not to be grouped with Silence of the Lambs or other serial killer films.As Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale delivers an Oscar worthy performance. He maintains his lunatic enthusiasm throughout the entire film.

"Flagrant-Baronessa","25 July 2006","Novel adaptation ""American Psycho"" is a fiercely comical, graphic, dark, and relevant satire directing blunt social criticism toward the perverse materialism in America in the 1980s, the soullessness of rich people and the lack of individualism among an entire generation of yuppies. Think it's too much to take? It isn't, as the film balances its dark themes with huge doses of well-placed comedy. We follow Patrick Bateman, superbly acted by Christian Bale, as a well-to-do Wall Street worker, Harvard graduate and killer sociopath at night.Director Mary Harron has bravely steered American Psycho away from a slasher horror path and zooms in more on the psyche of Patrick Bateman and his hatred for other people which for the most part is covered in a mask of sanity but which sometimes slips out and results in gory killing sprees in his apartment.American Psycho is an elegantly crafted thriller, making great use of high-praised art, vulgar fashion trends, refined decoration, luxurious food and expensive New York living -- all to illustrate the materialism of our time. This makes Patrick Bateman something of a modern day Gatsby, but with a morbid twist and complete lack of morals. This is a modern masterpiece, if faintly flawed -- mostly because it does not leave much feeling. The entire film is very detached since we follow a cruel, emotionless anti-hero and pointing to the hollowness of an entire generation, the film itself becomes a bit hollow.8/10",NA
"saadgkhan","13 August 2012","American Psycho– CATCH IT (A-) American Psycho is a cult phenomena and I have been hearing about this movie since its release but somehow never been able to watch it until now. The American Psycho revolves around a wealthy New York investment banking executive hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he escalates deeper into his illogical, gratuitous fantasies. American Psycho goes deep into the mind of human psychology and deals with the pressure of society to be perfect. The direction and writing of the movie is spectacular and it's brilliant to see that it's directed by a woman. That's why the all sexual and killing parts are more ecstatic than gross. Don't take me wrong defiantly killing someone with chainsaw is gross but it's not shot chainsaw massacre sort of gross. The movie is great till the final act where it leaves you tangling between what's real and what's not. Christian Bale is super as American Psycho caught between living perfect life and his darkest desires. There is sense of believe in everything he does and this whole attire, his physique was close to perfection. Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas and Jared Leto were good their parts but on the whole it was a one man show. American Psycho is a cult classic and if you like movies with open ending. Watch it!",NA
"DJAkin","23 June 2002","This was very scary and suspenseful.  Bateman's face was so sweaty the entire time.  I liked it.  There were many good scenes.  One of them was where Bateman ran after a call girl with a chainsaw naked!!  Naked and covered with blood.  That was a very disturbing scene.",NA
"emperor_bender","15 November 2007","I watched this movie, seeing its good reviews; in hopes of having: 1. a good movie villain who I could root for 2. a good hero, whom I could also root for and 3. a good story line......I got none of them. I only watched about 1/2 this movie before I shut it off because I was falling asleep. Patrick Bateman is such an idiot, he tries to be all sophisticated yet evil at the same time, but he fails miserably. He's trying to copy Hannibal Lecter but sucking at it. You could tell from the start that he's evil, he says it about 50 times. And he always says ""Im gonna kill you"". Thats really subtle. He does NOT have the style of killing that Hannibal Lecter does either, Lecter kills people in unique, interesting, and sneaky ways. Bateman does it so blatantly. His first victim is a homeless guy and his dog. He sits there and taunts a homeless guy, then stabs him. Then his dog barks at him so he stomps the poor thing to death. What kind of wuss is he? Can he not fight someone face-to-face? His second victim is a co-worker. But, he gets him drunk first. Then covers the furniture and carpet of his house and invites him over. They talk for 10 minutes then he hits him while off guard with an axe. I could tell for 10 minutes that he was going to kill him, hes not sneaky at all. Then...I guess I dozed off. And he describes himself as some kinda super villain. Hes pathetic!",NA
"ketgup83","4 September 2012","American Psycho turned out to be a surprise gruesome, psychotic, weird thriller which made an interesting watch thanks to stupendous performance by Christian Bale and powerful storyline.A wealthy banking executive is haunted by an alter-ego which he hides from his co-workers and friends but gets trapped further down into his own imaginations and horrifying fantasies.Directed by Mary Horon , American Psycho is based on a novel of same name by Bret Easton Ellis. Though the movie released some 10 years back but I got the opportunity to watch it now thanks to growing popularity of Christian Bale. I kept on hearing about the movie turning him into a popular star even before The Machinist and Batman Begin and I was not surprised a bit. The actor gets into the character of Patrick Bateman so effortlessly that it is difficult to identify any other actor playing that part. He is horrifying as a serial killer , he is masculine and handsome as a playboy flirting with women , he is innocent when he confesses to himself doing wrong stuff. It is the character that you feel weird , funny, angry and yet sympathizing for his mental illness. The climax is something similar to Inception where the director questions the audience that what is the conclusion. Direction is crunchy adding taste to the film every time new scene turns up. The movie has some disturbing scenes like where Bateman stabs the beggar and kills his dog by stamping on it , the scene where he narrates the feelings coming out of Phil Collin's song while two prostitutes are lying over each other and making out etc. This is certainly not for the weak-hearted audience. Screenplay is engaging , art direction is good along with superb dialogues. Christian Bale is the show-stopper. I have become a fan of this great actor after the movie. He emotes so accurately through his expressions and is complete natural.So overall , superb intellectual movie in all respect. Must Watch. Excellent 4.4/5",NA
"calyeager","29 March 2021","It's a film where identity is determined by brands, haircuts, and dinner reservations. There's a darkly sardonic feeling for the audience watching a world where even trying to get a table at Dorsia would result in gales of maniac laughter. Every character is self-absorbed and fails to read all of the others, from the kind Jean (played by Chloë Sevigny) who fails to realize Bale's Patrick Bateman is a literal serial killer to Dafoe's Donald Kimbell who seems to simultaneously understand and not know guilt. The film becomes a fever pitch nightmare where the ultimate actions of Bateman are unclear. I guess I don't mind personally adding my thought is that he did kill all of the people he said he did; I just think it makes a better story. Still, this confession means nothing. I give American Psycho a 9/10.",NA
"TheMelancholySpirit","17 September 2016","""...their early work was a little too... new wave, for my tastes.. but when sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own - commercially and artistically."" American Psycho is one of the most quotable movies ever made. It's a dark comedy / crime / drama from the year 2000, and of course its main star is Christian Bale. Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a wealthy investment bank executive from New York who has a bit of an ego. It appears, that Bateman is a psychopath and a serial killer, who has all these sick, twisted fantasies and own gruesome ways.As the film progresses, you're able to see his mind collapse and turn on him, as he goes from killing in control, to being uncontrollable. It's a pretty dark shift, but a very interesting one -- because the movie is, simply put, fantastic. I would have to say, as early as this, that the movie is one of the very best in cinematic history. It's my personal favorite of all time. It's incredible, and Christian Bale is a magnificent actor. He was absolutely brilliant in his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman, among many others... but this was, by far, the performance of his life. Nobody could have portrayed Patrick Bateman other than Bale himself, so it was a perfect casting choice for sure.The movie is dark, funny, violent, and at times can be confusing, but not in a bad way by any means. I would say that American Psycho is one of those movies that, although very, very good, doesn't quite have the total recognition that it so rightfully and so truly deserves. It's got a big large following of fans, though.It's a must-see film and I can't describe it as meaningfully as I would like to. I believe this is just simply, one of those, ""see for yourself, man!"" movies. It's a once in a lifetime movie, perhaps. It's that damn good! There are so many reasons as to why it's my all time favorite film. It's the perfect film for sure.Also, its ending? Here's where you may go wrong. You may come off thinking, ""So, it was all in his own head? He was just, like, imagining the whole scenario and stuff?"" Nope. Literally all of it happened (maybe excluding the bank statement thing with the cat.) You see, I can say (since it's spoiler-ticked review), that it all happens because: if you watch the movie, you'll see what these people are like. They're corrupted. They're greedy. They're selfish. They only want what's best for them, nothing more, nothing less. They barely know each other's real names, and don't care enough to find out what's true, what's proper. You know how like, Paul Allen thinks Bateman's name is Marcus Halberstram? That's an example. They don't care to find out what's right from wrong, truth from lies. So when the guy at the end of the film says, to Bateman: ""because I had dinner with Paul Allen, in London, (however many) days ago..."" what if the guy had dinner with who he thought, was Paul Allen? That's what I mean. Patrick would then continue to slip through and escape any cracks which would enclose him, and keep him with life in prison, or the death penalty.Truly, American Psycho is a remarkable movie. I must-see with so many fantastic moments.10 / 10 5 / 5",NA
"capkronos","7 May 2003","Bret Easton Ellis' novel was thought to be unfilmable, but it's great someone tried, and pulled no punches about it. Sure, some of the more sick and tasteless scenes were omitted, but the tone and biting satire of the piece remains, and that is what's important.Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a 1980s Wall Street tycoon in NYC who has it all...and he KNOWS it--good looks, a nice body, loads of money, a penthouse apartment and a rich bitch fiancée (Reese Witherspoon). He's also a psycho suffering from the shallowness, prejudice and personal anonymity in his upscale lifestyle who can't control his homicidal tendencies.This film is initially an assault on yuppiedom and 1980s conservatism (with perfect music score by John Cale and appropriately sunny pop tunes), and although this doesn't necessarily have enough satiric stabs for a feature length movie, it's compulsively watchable nonetheless. In a world of platinum cards, Valentino suits, decadent nightclubs, A-list restaurants and exaggeratedly vapid characters, it's pretty outrageous seeing Bale (who's terrific) stab a bum (""Get a goddamn job!""), axe a coworker, aim a nail gun at the back of his meek secretaries head and, covered in blood, chasing a hooker down a hallway with a chainsaw. He also quotes Ed Gein, watches Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (and porn tapes), and listens to Ronald Reagan lie on national TV about Iran Contra.Like Harron's I SHOT ANDY WARHOL, the movie, no matter how out-there it gets, is grounded by the extremely passionate, uncompromising beliefs of the protagonist. Harron co-scripted with Guinevere Turner (who also appears as a victim). On a side note, the amusing raincoat/murder scene may have actually been borrowed from the film Hollywood CHAINSAW HOOKERS!",NA
"Caustic Pulp","2 May 2000","American Psycho isn't for everyone. But it's a comedy in horror film's clothing. And while I didn't entirely get the satire, as I was just a kid when all this raging consumerism was going on, I can tell you this...the movie itself is a laugh riot... ...provided you can appreciate relatively black comedy and have a sense for the truly absurd. I think it's safe to say that this movie was designed to be funny. Some of the scenes are so awkward you know it was intentional. This movie basks in genre-referential humor and a taste for truly absurd comedy. So while my friend and I were rolling in the aisles, I noticed a few people in the theatre just didn't get it.Go to see this movie without expecting anything in particular from it. Go to see it to be entertained. Loosen up a bit. It's not supposed to be chilling, or frightening, or horrifying, or thrilling. It's supposed to be funny.

"ElijahCSkuggs","21 August 2008","So I've seen this movie a couple times, and after some recommendations, I decided to read the book.I don't want to turn this into a book review, but let's just say that if you're interested in something a little more graphic, a little more dark, and a little more in depth  check out the book. Immediately. And when I say ""a little more,"" that means a crap load more. It's also a lot funnier than the movie.But as far as the flick goes, it's also not too shabby. Not shabby at all.It has a nice visual style, solid directing, good pacing, and a performance from Christian Bale  especially in the last 15 minutes or so  that is simply awesome. His work is reason enough to see it alone. And I'm no Bale-kisser either. He's just damn good in this.So aside from the acting, there's some blood, some sex, some nudity, some Huey Lewis and the News, and a few hilarious scenes that make you shake your head.As much as they suck when you have to deal with them, snobs are funny, and this movie demonstrates just that.

Patrick Bateman: ""My need to engage in homicidal behaviour on a massive scale cannot be corrected, but, ah, I have no other way to fulfil my needs""Another good point to the film is that its not as gory as the book but thats okay Patrick Bateman: My nightly blood lust has overflown into my days I feel lethal on the verge of frenzy, I think my mask of sanity is about to slip...Overall the script has been well written and the use of a female director excludes the male dominant need for the main character to kill everyone and have an explosive action scene.

"Det_McNulty","25 February 2008","Christian Bale is arguably modern cinema's most underrated actor. I sometimes consider hailing him as the greatest performer of this generation, particularly whenever I re-watch his leap-to-fame performance in American Psycho. On its release it erroneously received mixed acclaim; nevertheless, Bale was nearly always commended for performing in the remarkably charismatic role of Patrick Bateman. The character ranks among contemporary literature's greatest creations, and back in 2000 a young Bale somehow managed to embody the yuppie maniac. The character's slickly menacing demeanour, attentive idiosyncrasies, and always brewing revulsion is intuitively mastered in this offbeat satire. Patrick Bateman is both the definitive New York yuppie and the ultimate sociopath. He is masked by the Wall Street businessman persona, and his pastime activities are unnoticed by his self-obsessed associates- like himself. He thrives off a colossal maze of jealously, established on distaste for any minor, physical and social hiccup. Little do such men know that they are dehumanising any merit they once had.Bret Easton Ellis' original novel contains possibly the most graphic depictions of sex and violence in any novel I have ever read. Appropriately, director Mary Harron places much of the novel's explicit content off-screen, similar to how the book simply lets the reader imagine the vivid nature of the content. For this reason, American Psycho is faithful to its source, and for a novel which includes such terminal violence there is still a huge amount of wit and charm. This owes to the book's satirical disposition, with its brazen accuracy and jagged humour. It is in many respects an absurdist's take on an already surreal culture; this lends the questionable theme of subjective reality to the protagonist's actions and experiences. Mary Harron utilises the satirical facets of the novel, and essentially uses satire as a device of ridiculing yuppie culture. Nevertheless, the component which is best suited is that this image of an alpha-male dominated society, which is directed from a female standpoint, but not an overtly feminist one. More than anything, American Psycho is a critique of ignorance, materialism and self-infatuation.The cast play it cool throughout the feature, concurrently sinking their teeth into the bitter irony of cultural stereotypes. For those of you who might be put off by the sardonic title; don't be. This is a twisted and intelligent take on cultural archetypes, with much prominence being placed on whether the viewer deems Patrick Bateman's sociopath alter-ego a manifestation of sub-conscious monotony or that he is genuinely committing the murderous, masochistic acts shown on screen. Whichever way you look at it, there is no definitive answer, but one thing is for sure, that this cinematic assertion is a strong sentiment of yuppie narcissism. As dark as it may seem, there is no denying the indisputable entertainment quality of a film crammed with meaningful malevolence. This is a film which unsympathetically attacks the business world, implying that dumb people from wealthy backgrounds are groomed for slacker success. These white collar machines are not savvy, nor do they even so much as turn a blind-eye to anyone other than their materialistic statements of self-worth. In a way, this is their only means of clinging onto reality, for they hide behind their denial, with a reputable image of self-worth.",NA
"DarthBill","8 October 2004","Christian Bale stars as Patrick Bateman, a successful, dashingly handsome yuppie with a little ray of sunshine for a fiancé to whom he feels no real emotional attachment (Reese Witherspoon) while all the while cheating on her with her best friend (Samantha Mathis) and making comments to his secretary that she should really wear skirts and high heels instead of pants and flats. Bateman is also harboring a dark secret: he likes to kill people, regardless of whether they're homeless men, fellow yuppies or the slutty women he sleeps with. Why? No particular reason it seems, except perhaps that all the years of maintaining an outer image of success and perfection have taken their toll on his mental health and he finds that killing people is the only way out for him. But when he murders fellow yuppie Jared Leto and starts getting investigated by an underused Willem Dafoe's detective, things get sticky. Based on a book that I haven't read and probably wouldn't want to read.Bale gives a spirited performance as the lunatic yuppie out on a killing spree (probably one of the reasons he got tapped for the part of Batman by Christopher Nolan), but the film doesn't seem to know where its going and offers no real closure. Not for all tastes. Keep out of the reach of little children.",NA

The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Willem Dafoe and Jared Leto.The film's direction and cinematography are equally impressive, with director Mary Harron creating a bleak and eerie atmosphere that perfectly matches the tone of the story. The use of music and pop culture references from the era also help to transport the viewer to the world of the 1980s.However, the film's extreme violence and graphic nature may be too much for some viewers. The scenes of brutal murder and torture are disturbing and difficult to watch, and the film's overall message can be somewhat ambiguous.In conclusion, ""American Psycho"" is a highly stylized and well-acted film that will leave a lasting impression on its viewers.",NA
"zdamico","8 September 2023","Memes aside, American Psycho is an incredible horror satire film. American Psycho delves into many thought-provoking themes such as consumerism, conformity, human connection, pop culture, class & more-and loads of essays could be written about each one. I could get into each of these, but for the sake of brevity, my most significant takeaway is below.Many people ponder whether Patrick actually committed the murders (I don't think he did), but the bigger question should be: What is Patrick's desire? Well, he actually tells us. The key line of dialogue occurs when Jean asks him if he ever wanted to make someone happy, to which he replies, ""I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special."" This, in my opinion, is Patrick's genuine desire. Throughout the film, every relationship he engages in is shallow and vapid, with coworkers solely focused on wealth and status, and sexual partners viewed merely as objects.Also, the remarkable humor in this film cannot be understated (see the business card scene). The balance of satire, humor, and horror in American Psycho is truly masterful.",NA

"rominaguaychacabrera","17 April 2021","What a great directing, let me just start by that. I constantly imagine myself reading the screenplay being like WHAT THE HELL and i invite you to do that. Thanks to the talented work of Christian Bale and Marry Harron we have this masterpiece, this was their work, i can´t imagine DiCaprio doing this, it wouldn´t be the same. This film didn´t need a good actor, they needed BALE.This contains so many lines i can quote on a daily basis.And i must say you won´t get tired of this, and you must watch it again to understand some little details.Amazing elements.",NA
"adriantopnik","13 April 2020","American Psycho is actually a pretty fun movie. Am i sick for thinking that? Maybe. The other thing I love about it is that it's still being talked about to this very day. Also, the movie doesn't give that much closure, you can think that it was all fake. But you can think that it all happened. Oh good, it's soo gooood!!",NA
"Buddy-51","28 October 2000","No doubt about it, Mary Harrion's `American Psycho' is definitely not for every taste and audience demographic.  The good news is, perhaps, that the film is nowhere near as gruesome and gory as both its subject matter and its controversial nature would lead one to believe.  In fact, its tone of ironic comic detachment helps to de-emphasize the more sordid aspects of the material and to instead highlight the film's bitingly satiric message. 
Set in the mid-1980's, `American Psycho' casts a scathing eye on the then-brand new, up-and-coming group of 20-something executives known as `yuppies.'  Patrick Bateman, the psycho of the title, is a man who literally seems to have everything  stunning good looks, a fantastic physique, a beautiful fiancé, a diploma from Harvard and a successful career as a Wall Street executive.  Yet, alone of the young men with whom he consorts, Patrick flatly admits to us in voice-over narration that he is literally an empty-suit - that his perfectly maintained outer appearance, seemingly well-ordered social routine and empty, superficial personal relationships merely mask the moral emptiness that lurks at the core of his soul.  Much of the complexity of Patrick's character comes from the fact that he seems, paradoxically, to be both obsessed with the idea of conforming to the values of the world he lives in, and, at the same time, being strangely conscious of their unreality and meaninglessness.  Thus, we see him becoming almost emotionally unglued because he fears he will not be able to reserve the proper table at a posh upscale restaurant or because he feels that one of his corporate buddies has a more impressive looking business card than he does.  Much of Patrick's madness has its roots in the kind of obsessive-compulsive paranoia that arises from the modern insistence that life should and, indeed, can be converted into a perfect, problem-free existence if one just has enough money and a sufficient amount of the right `stuff' to make it that way.  Frankly admitting that he feels no emotional attachment to any other human beings, Patrick is thereby free to channel his madness into its ultimate anti-social, taboo-shattering shape and form: serial killing.  Thus, as days turn to nights, Patrick begins to rack up his victims and potential victims  a homeless man, assorted prostitutes, an ex-girlfriend, an unctuous business associate, even some policemen who get wise to his activities later in the film.  Luckily for the squeamish among us, far more of the film's running time is devoted to a comic rather than thriller mode.  The brittle, dryly humorous Mary Harrion/Guinevere Turner screenplay mines the corporate world milieu and the twisted rantings of a values-free mind for all their black comedy potential.  Christian Bale brings a remarkable subtlety to a touchy role, managing to seem coolly alluring, chillingly detached, touchingly pathetic and wryly amusing all at the same time.   Special credit should go to the stark, almost antiseptic look the filmmakers achieve through the art direction and set design, a look that matches in visual terms the moral and emotional emptiness of the characters and their world. 
Much was made of the anti-woman tone of the novel at the time of its initial release. Perhaps because the writers and the director are themselves women, the movie seems to have toned down that aspect quite a bit.  Indeed, as in a movie like `In the Company of Men,' we find ourselves not so much appalled as sadly bemused by the vehemently anti-women comments uttered by Patrick and his cronies because we see what shallow losers these men really are. Harrion and Turner obviously know whereof they speak.To reiterate, `American Psycho' may not be everyone's cup of cinematic tea, but those looking for a sharp little satire of modern American life will find some definite rewards.",NA
"knows_film","9 January 2007","American Psycho is way better than Psycho.Alfred Hitchcock passed on American Psycho in favor of Psycho because American Psycho was too American for him. Being British he couldn't handle the Americanism of the subject matter.Originally Patrick was to be Norman's Father. But given the 40 year window of their release dates; it's now Norman who is Patrick's father. Which probably works better; like Luke in Starwars the force is stronger in Patrick and he becomes a better psycho than his father. BUT both the bates are good its just Patrick is the better bate's man.American Psycho is the must see film of the decade. I haven't seen a better constructed; intellectually executed slasher film since before the genre was incepted. The scene where Patrick introduces himself to an unemployed homeless black man named Al and tells him to get a job before stabbing him to death became an instant; all-time-classic.",NA
"adam_pittavino","13 June 2018","Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 novel of the same title gave readers the perfect insight to America's corporate obsession with materialism as greed and escess seemed to replace what was wholesome and warm about the decade before it. The 1980's is the right environment for an emotionally bankrupt, ego driven maniac to pursue his blood thirsty tendencies as Christian Bale dishes up Patrick Bateman, one of cinemas most talked about characters in recent memory. Patrick works on wall street. He's a sneering, condesending, selfish and shallow psychotic that commits blatant, random acts of violence, his pseudo-preppie diction noticeable but not unfamilier when in social circles. One memorable scene has Bateman comparing buisness cards with his colleague's, a fierce undertone of jealousy washes over him as he realises their offerings maybe be more impressive than his own. On the surface, his personality fits in with the crowd he surrounds himself with, but his disregard for peoples feelings, let alone their lives is what ultimetely drives his lust for killing. American Psycho isnt overly gory, it isnt overly violent, but its ambitious and confident and these traits are what made it one of the best films of the year. American Psycho is many things, part black comedy, part horror but above all its a satire on a generation that knows no limits.",NA
