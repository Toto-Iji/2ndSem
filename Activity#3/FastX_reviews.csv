"MamadNobari97","30 June 2023","I thought they couldn't possibly write something even worse than F9, but here we are.This movie is just excruciating to watch and the 2 hours felt like a really long 5 hour movie to me. It's just a dumb action scene after a dumb action scene that never ends, until the movie just ends out of nowhere. Like even filler TV show episodes have better story structures and endings than this.This movie might be better than F9 for some, which is understandable since it's all because of Jason Momoa. Hell, I don't even remember a thing that happened in the last movie, but I won't forget Momoa's character here any time soon. So I get why this would be more watchable and better for some, if not most people because of Momoa, but I think it's worse and Momoa's character gets tired and annoying really fast.The biggest problem of this movie is that the writers don't have the balls to actually kill a main character and actually hurt the ""family"". So instead they introduce new characters out of nowhere and bring back characters from Fast Five so they could kill them instead and make Dom care about them instead of actually killing his real ""family"". Because they already brought back so many characters from the dead that they know they would have to bring back the ones they kill here in Fast 13.Not to mention all the unnecessary unfunny long scenes that contribute little to nothing to the story and only pad the runtime and make you want to do literally anything else but continue watching it, like the black market scene with the ever unfunny Pete Davidson.There are just an awful amount of long useless scenes that make you more sleepy. This movie is a really good cure for insomnia.Like if you cut 90% of Tej/Roman/Ramsey scenes, nothing changes here and actually helps the awful pacing of the movie and gets rid of unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the plot. But then again, it's the only time you have a breather between the awful action scene.The story structure is just plain awful and the movie feels more like a bunch of random action scenes jumbled together than having an actual plot structure.Compare this to the storytelling of Fast Five which this movie loves to use a lot of footage of it and retcon it's story, remind you how much better the writing and action scenes were, and basically ruin it. It's not like the old movies were masterpieces, but at least the writer knew how to keep the action somewhat grounded, and how to keep the characters interesting and to have a decent balance between action and dialogue and characterization.Those movies were mediocrely written, but at least they were competently mediocre with actual story structures and characters that felt like real humans to some degree. They were actually entertaining because they did the bare minimum of keeping it grounded and realistic enough for your suspension of disbelief and also with the characters so you would care about them enough to watch a 2-hour movie of them doing all of that.But these last two movies have just been some of the worst writings I've ever seen and they feel like they weren't even written by adult humans and with the worst dialogue imaginable. This one is particular feels like it's just a collage of some random bs they wrote on the story board.They also try to make and take everything so seriously to a point that that alone makes it hilarious, now add a jester villain to the mix and you have this ridiculous amalgam of ridiculousness that wants you to take it seriously but you can't do anything but roll your eyes and facepalm.The movie is already bad and you want it to end badly from very early on, but the ending itself is so bad that it's insulting honestly.All of that with a lot of other problems that I do not care to list and waste any more time talking about this garbage, along with the fact that you already didn't care an ounce about these characters and stories in F9, make this movie worse than the previous one for me and gets a 1/10 from me. Somehow I feel like they can even go lower and deliver us an even worse mess of a movie with the next one, but the writers of that are apparently different and more experienced, so we have to wait and see but I doubt anyone could save this at this point. But, this movie sets the lowest bar possible, so you must be an actual genius to somehow write something worse than Fast X's script.","

"feritciva","15 July 2023","I can write the exact same review for the last Transformers, last Indiana Jones, last Star Wars movies, last FF or last Marvel movies etc... What happaned people? Something has happened in movie industry in late 2010's - 2017 or 18. We cannot see any decent plot, any consistent story-telling or any sympathetic characters anymore. Day after day we have to endure more & more imbecilic movies with idiotic characters... new movies come out and this pattern never changes.It's really not an easy job to be a movie-lover as of 2020's! :((PS: .... and we see the above trend here in imdb too, as it insists on some ""minimum character limit"". Oh my!!","

"BA_Harrison","19 May 2023","Fast & Furious 9 did what a lot of franchises do at some point: it took the action into outer space. This seemed to me like a good point to call it quits. But with the money still rolling in, nobody in Hollywood was going to end this cash cow; thus we have Fast X, the first in a rumoured three part finale (until the inevitable reboot).I've been on board with the franchise since the start, sticking with it as it moved from the street racing world into more James Bond territory, the action getting more and more ridiculous with each chapter. Seeing how each movie would top the one before in terms of craziness is what kept me entertained. But Fast X is just dumb, and it's not even dumb fun.The stunts are more preposterous than ever, but the film is never thrilling, every interminable action scene enhanced by rather ropey CGI (the flames, in particular, look really bad). There are some dreadful attempts at humour (mostly courtesy of Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris), and we get all that inevitable crap about the importance of family (if I see the gang having another barbecue I think I'll hurl).And then there's Jason Momoa as villain Dante...I can see what they were going for -- kooky flamboyant psycho capable of almost anything -- but Momoa is absolutely awful, his performance bordering on camp, not helped by the character's dubious choice of attire. It's hard to find Dante menacing when he's flouncing about in a silky shirt. I'll no doubt watch the next two films for the sake of completion, but with Momoa on board it'll be hard going.Fast X is easily the weakest of the series so far, but I'll give it 3/10 because I guess things could get even worse.","

"Prismark10","1 June 2023","By this point, I went to see Fast X without a clue as to what happened in the last one. I think some people went to space.The F&F series is one where villains become friends, people come back from the dead and cars defy the laws of physics. No one has an idea of the story soon after they watched it.A plot inspired by Fast 5, where they stole a safe and rode it along the streets of Rio de Janeiro.Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa) is the sociopathic son of Hernan Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) and he wants to make Dom Toretto and his family suffer for what happened to his dad.The main action starts by dropping a big rolling bomb in Rome and aim it for the Vatican.Plagued with behind the scenes issues. Original director Justin Lin departed soon after shooting started. Director Louis Leterrier does a workmanlike job. As he showed in the Netflix series Lupin, Now You See Me as well as The Transporter movies. He can do car stunts as well as sleight of hand. Some of the CGI looked cheap though.As for Momoa, the director obviously told him. Man you will never play the Joker, too Polynesian. So Dante is your Joker and dial it up to 12. He is loud, camp and is having a ball. Especially with those two IT guys with a funny grin on their faces.Some of the regulars are even more tiresome. A few should had showed up but did not like those two Brazilian guys from the earlier movies. John Cena plays lovable Uncle Jacob, he was the main villain in the last one.The movie actually has four Oscar winning actresses. Not one of them told Vin Diesel how to do dramatic. When Dom had these small tender scenes, I nearly fell asleep.","

"gehete-40949","28 June 2023","You know the deal by now, family, fast cars, hot girls(not so many this time), A-list celebrities, cheesy dialogue and story all wrapped up in a high budget movie that barely makes sense. It is not supposed to make sense of course. Even if there ever was an attempt to convey street racing culture at the beginning of the franchise all is but gone replaced by a forgettable action flick that deserves to be a streaming only release.If you went to the cinemas for this bore fest of pointless explosions I feel bad for you. I am not even go into the story, the only saving grace of these movies at this point is the polished cg and well done stunts. Just do society a favor and stop rewarding mindless micheal bay movies.","

"towe-51620","26 May 2023","I have to admit all you people who forewarned me still didn't prepare me for the absolute most ridiculous movie in this franchise & definitely in the top 20 of worst movies ever! Everything was forced, the acting was stale and wooden, nobody seemed to care that they were looking like what they were out there doing! Stroking Vin's ego and not caring how they came across. They were all just going through the motions of a movie with less plot the Wiley Coyote and the Roadrunner. Momoa did a cheap imitation of Ledgers Joker and every part of this movie was just one lifted from 1 or more of the previous 9 movies! The car in outer Space was 10 times better than this 10 year olds version of the Fast & Furious. Fast is just a blatant rip off of Point Break. Walker was Keanu as Johnny Utah, Vin as Swayze's Bohdi. Instead of surfing it's cars and in some they actually rob a bank or two. This movie should never have been made as it contains nothing of what made this group of films popular as they are. The next one hopefully will be the last forever! Whoever gave this more than a 1 has to be somebody related to someone in the movie or a 5 year old! This was so bad that it wasn't even funny and the torment lasted almost 3 hours of non stop chaos and pointless plots with going back and forth between too many storylines that were not connected or understandable! If you don't want to waste 3 hours of your life, skip this and watch Looney Tunes, they are superior in every way!","

"akshatmahajan","15 June 2023","The movie starts it story from the first ten minutes of Fast Five. The story starts out of nowhere and thr scenes are not even connected properly with each other. Any scene comes out of nowhere. The performances by all the cast members felt weak and the character development of the main Villian was bad. Jason's character wanted revenge in the movie but it more looked like he was a psycho who kills people for fun. The main problem with this franchise is saturated. It feels like we have seen all this millions of times and the action scenes doesn't amaze you.Overall, it was an average action movie and the franchise has reached fatigue.","

"schorschi100","8 June 2023","I am (was) a huge fan of the ""fast and the furious"" series, and of Vin Diesel. Although I am a physicist I can live with ""curbing"" the laws of nature to some extent, provided that this is justified (e.g., through SciFi, magic, alternate universes etc.). It is also OK in movies like Mission Impossible and similar to drive things to the extreme. However, when both physics AND logic go awry it's simply too much.The main villain in the story, (Dante, played by an amazing Jason Mamoa) is simply a joke. He is super intelligent, super rich, super powerful, and a caricature of a sociopath à la Joker. He is able to organize his crimes (which are purely driven by hatred) in such perfect timing across the globe and with access to every possible computer, that his abilities surpass those of Robert Langdon's foes (DaVince code), of Thanos (Avengers) and all James Bonds enemies at once. It borders ridicule. And, the most importantly, makes the film boring.In the next episode they are going probably to have spaceships racing across the galaxy I guess, and Dante will use nuclear fusion to kill.Acting is generally from decent to very good (well it's not Shakespeare after all, so not utterly important), and the cinematography (referring to the effects) excellent. Unfortunately a nice packaging does not salvage a really bad content.Finally, I really abhor cliffhangers, and I seldom (if ever) have seen such an infuriating one. It's one thing to leave things open in a story, and quite a different one to literally stop the action in the middle of the most intense scene, like someone just pulled the plug of the TV. This practically means the producers where so sure the viewer will not watch the next one, that they had to use every means to animate them to do so. Plain awful and tasteless.In a whole this is by far the worst of an otherwise very good series. If you really want to watch it, at least wait until the next one comes out to save yourself the frustration of the unfinished scene.","

"hectordanielbuelna","19 May 2023","Fast X finally went too far.As far as I remember, people keep complaining about this movies being dumb, however, people often dismisses the the charm of the action and the overcomplicated plots of crazy writers trying to show how smart they are. This time they actually went too far.Once again they retcon an old movie by adding scenes that weren't there. Once again they got caught on a ""revenge plot"" and once again family has to come together to defeat evil. They quite literallu rehashed the plot of the last 2-3 movies, but this time they got lazy!The whole family is vack qith a brand new cast.Allan Ritchson, I love the guy, but he can't act to save his life. He has the funniest dialogues in the entire movie, though.Alison Brie, the second worse actor in the entire movie, has absolutely no chemistry with the entire cast. It's actually impressive, she seem uncomfortable in every scene. I don't get it.John Cena again charming his way into making you like his character, he can't act either, but he actually takes advantage of the dialogues and his own phisicality to sell the Jacob Toretto.And Jason Momoa... Just played a goofier Joker. Jared Leto would be proud. He's even obsessed with the color purple. Someone must've felt very cheeky when he said something on the lines of ""I don't wanna kill them, I just want to hurt them real bad"". What a failure of a villain. Jumping back and forwards between a serious villain and an clown.This was, overall, a very dull, uninteresting and boring disappointment. Fast 9 shoulda been the last one.Not looking forward to the sequels to this mess, not at all.","

"A_Different_Drummer","10 June 2023","The late media guru Marshall McLuhan offered the world an interesting meme, called Media Ecology, which finally acknowledged the resources used in media as precious and drew attention to their waste. Nobody else had ever noticed this. (Much like in our current upside-down age nobody notices the rare earth resources needed to make electric cars the standard). In terms of media ecology, this may be the most wasteful movie produced in decades. The actors, the props, the stunts, all devoted to shutting down a franchise that blew a tire years ago and never got it patched. The sheer incompetence of this script is clear from the character that Momoa tries so hard to breathe life into ... and fails. By the time the Big FInale rolls down the highway, at the 2:00:00 mark, the poor viewer is no longer rooting for the Good Guys or the Bad Guys. Only for Father Time to arrive and end the spectacle before any more careers can be burned in the conflagration. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

"tomsawyer-01858","30 June 2023","First, the car actions are great, a lot of imagination, a lot of CGI, and great locations.In-between, we get some asskicking, much more ordinary.Following these hate scenes, we get some emotional scenes.Like love for family is everything. And of course some of them are dying to go back to some hate.Diesel is such a bad actor, impossible to accept any of his emotional scenes, be it love or hate. He has not evolved in 20years of filming. There is nothing in between, just primitive emotions for the brainless.Jason Momoa is the bad guy, followed be some minor bad guys. His character is so over the top, and he obviously enjoyed the acting. But some maniac jokes of bad taste are not funny at all.His scenes are the only ones worth watching along with the fake computer generated car stunts, who throw overboard the most basic laws of physics. It is just incredible how many stuntmen and visual effects experts worked on that movie. I suppose each one only worked on 5 seconds of a scene. They all need to be paid, and it surely takes a hell of a resource management to make it a coherent finished product.The music is just annoying during the stunts, just too loud, a brain killer...For a budget of 349 mio USD, a lot of stars appear just for a few seconds, like they visit to attract people to the theatres to keep the money flowing in, and leave with the loot.I won't name them, I don't want to be an acomplice of their deception...","

"exceladeogun","18 June 2023","Fast XA big splashy pile of rubbish. The plot is a poor rehash of the former movies, with nothing new or compelling to it.The performance by the cast is mostly bland, except for Jason Momoa and John Cena. This is the most impassive and drab portrayal of Dominic Toretto by Vin Diesel, and this is especially frustrating, as this is meant to be the beginning of the end of this franchise. The supporting characters are numerous, but due to the short screentime and unceremonious entry they have, they all seem like an endless introduction of cameos. Jason Momoa as the villain of this movie is the best thing. He's charismatic and campy, and his jokeresque performance is refreshing. John Cena also gives a good performance, with a good blend of bravado and hilarity.This franchise is hinged on farfetched action but this instalment is sheer dumb, and the funny ridiculousness that the former instalments have is absent here. The CGI is not good, and the direction and editing can be choppy at times, this is especially poor seeing as this is the sixth most expensive movie ever made, wonder where all the money went, probably to the sprawling uninteresting cast.3.5/10.","

"laplante-co-672-297856","25 June 2023","You know a franchise is bankrupt when it ends on a cliffhanger... and you just shrug with disinterest.Vin Diesel walks around looking perpetually constipated. Villain Jason Mamoa seems to be channeling Heath Ledger's Joker at times. Former stone cold bad guy, John Cena, is now the goofy half of a road trip duo. Helen Mirren's Queenie is dropped in for just one scene with no explanation as to how she got there. Does it make sense? No, it's strictly for fan service. Michelle Rodriguez... okay she's still hot so I was fine with any of her scenes, even the dumb one where she wakes up in an underground prison in the Antarctic.I thought it couldn't get any stupider after they went into space in the last movie. I was wrong. Not only are some of the action set pieces stupider in this movie, but they look worse for it as a result of some sub-par CGI. Early on, the crew deals with a giant nuclear bomb/ bowling ball rolling endlessly through the streets of Rome. Watch the reactions on the faces of the background crowds as they scurry out of the way. They are underwhelmed as they react to something that will be digitally inserted later on. You'll react the same way.It's not surprising this disappeared from theatres so quickly.","

"dorMancyx","22 May 2023","I had a mission walking into that theater, and that is to count the number of ""family"" spoken in this movie. At the end of the day, I got about 2 ""familia"", 3 ""fam"", and a grand total of 28 ""family"". See if they can break that record next time!Nothing much needs to be commented about the film itself: we launched cars into space last time to destroy satellites, what less could you expect? Screw the logistics, screw physics, and screw Newton with his screwing apple tree! And guess what, if you do manage to stay awake after an hour, you'll start to understand how F&F actually survives the 22-year journey of production --- by not giving a screw! Hey, remember when Gal Gadot's character got blew up? Yeah screw that she quitting DCU so we resurrects her in our universe. Remember how Jakob was the cold-blooded villain just one movie before this? Screw that we got Peacemaker to play him this time cuz it makes great comedy. Remember when not even Dune dared announcing sequels until the first week of release? Screw that, Villeneuve ain't know nothing about making sequels, we bringing Fast 12 on the calendar while releasing the trailer!So yeah, here we are, anticipating Fast 11 next year, when the man named Dominic I-Am-Groot Toretto asserts dominion over Dante the Jokerized Aquaman, of course, with the help of his family.","

"abisio","19 May 2023","Original Fast and the Furious was copy of Point Break (a not very successful masterpiece that later become a cult classic) exchanging surf boards by cars. It worked and guarantee a sequel but Diesel was not interested so it was replaced by Tyrese Gibson. The movie was highly successful but produces decide to do a cheap one in Tokyo; that end up with a Diesel cameo granting the fourth installment.The fourth part had the original protagonists and made some money; so after a while Diesel become one of the producers and with the higher budget and few spectacular scenes became an absolute blockbuster.That luck lasted for the next four movies; keeping mostly the same cast (minus some dead that came back to life) and strongly villains and spectacular almost realistic scenes.Weil it is not the case here. The only good thing is Momoa doing the bad guy and having fun; and John Cena doing some kind of sympathetic monster.The rest of the cast; as good as usually is; has very little to do; and has little interaction with Diesel.Diesel itself is a complete disaster. He barely act and is basically Superman; it was a thief originally but now became a generous loving person who only cares about his family and friends.Louis Leterrier and usually good action movie director used to lower budget movies; does not seems confortable with this one.The special effects are very poor; that last sequences is really lame and very cheap made and the movie is overload with fight sequences and very little cars ones. In fact the most spectaculars are the ones showed from FF 5 a few times during this movie.To make matters worse; the script is absurd; overly long (141 minutes) and the movie has no ending; leaving open for X2 or XIIn brief; do not lose your time; is obviously the intention was to squeeze the franchise make some extra bucks but at least should have try to keep the level of the previous movies.","

From poor kids stealing to upgrade their cars fro the love of race, now we have cars in space, burning giant ball bombs, Azkaban prizons, some gay-sloppy avengers and nothing from the original vibe and magic. I watched because I was drunk and bored but this crossed all lines. I can't imagine what money actor get to play this, but there's no family or fans or whatever - this is a shame recorded for money. Imagine if those money went for a good cause, not cheap - expensive effects and idiotic plot... I liked FF, now I don't.","

"fairdraconica","2 July 2023","Surprisingly, the only interesting and entertaining character in this film is Jacob, played by John Cena. I guess, wrestlers know how to entertain people, which is something that film-makers have, apparently, forgotten.I expected nothing good after the previous film, but I didn't expect anything this bad. The characters of Dom and Letty are so badly written it hurts. How could you let the main(!) characters drop the ball like this?Speaking of the ball; the idea with the giant, round bomb that has to detonate in a body of water was stolen from the Batman franchise. Are they even capable of creating anything original anymore?The rest of the 'family' continues the trend of becoming more and more unwatchable and unbearable with each new instalment.They probably decided that the cliché of an annoying kid character that tries to behave like an adult for comic relief was a good idea. It wasn't. The kid, by the way, looks like neither of his parents, nor does he look like the baby that Dom brought home years ago. I felt no connection between the boy and the beloved characters of Elena and Dom.But, of course, it gets worse, because we're subjected to the pure torture of having to tolerate the most talentless and uncharismatic actress this franchise has ever seen... Brie Larson. I wanted to put my head in the oven every time she opened her mouth.","

"Top_Dawg_Critic","23 May 2023","I mean they didn't even try to hide the fact they are all mostly two word titles with copy-pasting the same sentences in different order in one paragraph. Racing Victors, Racing Heat, Racing Rivals, Racing Independence, Racing Mavericks, Racing Tranquility, Racing Liberty, Racing Bliss, Racing Winners, Racing Explorer, Racing Heaven... and many, many more - and those are just the titles starting with Racing, there are other obvious patterns with different title words.This has to be a world record for bogus ChatGPT reviews. I mean it's pretty bad when the producers have to stoop so low, and they're that lazy to even hide the fact they are trying to fool their audience this way. It also proves how little faith they have in their own film. The current Rotten Tomatoes critics 54% rating is a more accurate. I gave it a generous 6/10.It's too bad more effort didn't go into the writing and S/VFX (which needed major toning down and lacked realism), as they put towards trying to fool their fans of the franchise. This was too long, too slow, and too cartoonish. The writing was infantile, like it was written by a bunch of prepubescent giggly teens, and Momoa's character was too overboard and can't be taken in long doses. They basically tried to copy The Joker's character instead of creating his own persona. His performance however was still the most engaging and entertaining. Don't even get me started on the lame ending which will punish anyone following Vin Diesel on social media with him constantly counting down the days until the next ridiculous part 2 of Fast X. They should've just put us all out of our misery and ended this franchise at a nice even number.Nevertheless, still a decent popcorn watch riddled with brainless exposes of plot holes and nonsense entertainment, especially if you have nothing better to do and almost 3 hours to waste.","

What a change from the bog standard ""bad guy"". Again, I liked Shaw. But its not enough to save Fast X. The absolute kicker, was the surprise survival of a character. Just leave it be.

"ItsRobinTV","17 May 2023","I don't know what I expected from this movie. It's a total mess. But let's try to stay positive and start with a good point.The opening is probably the best part of the movie so make sure you enjoy it. Additionally, all the scenes with Jacob were surprisingly good and funny where on the other hand the scenes with Roman and Tej aren't that funny anymore. Also you need to stay till the Post credit scene. I would say it's worth the wait.But enough good things. The story is very bad. Normally, the action compensates the bad story but this is not the case here because the action is also one of the worst we have seen in a Fast & Furious movie yet combined with even worse VFX. Furthermore, the cars should be a very important aspect of the movie but no, not in this one. The cars play a pretty small part and are just there so they can call it a Fast & Furious movie. Also the movie is too long. We only see bad action after bad action and then learn about how a new character is related to this whole family, just boring.And the most important question: Are the scenes realistic? Not really but after we have seen a car in Space the scenes are relatively realistic.With this movie Universal just wanted to make money but completely forgets about us fans. After we watched it we are forced to watch the next one and spend even more money which is just too bad. Well, I think that was everything and I hope you enjoyed this review.","

"movieman_kev","20 May 2023","#FastX (Spoiler-free)At this point, I don't know if spoilers for certain aspects of this film would in fact be spoilers or be considered a PSA, but I digress. I get ahead of myself. Let's start from the beginningMomma always taught me not to write angry. My local AMC being a scant 2 miles from my apartment, I decided it was as good a time as any to heed that axiom. Perhaps the brisk walk home would calm me down. Settle my nerves. Perhaps I could even devise a less profanity-laden diatribe of how awful this film was and approach it in a state of zen.The walk worked a tad but when I started writing I could feel the seeth start anew. The endless cliched dialog recycled from countless other films, the stale humor way past its expiration date, the ok action sequences that were better done in previous Fast and furious films. The Ending... all of these intertwined to leave a rancid taste in my mouth.Even the parts of the film that worked (Jason Momoa makes for a reasonably fun villain, Statham is always a joy to watch doing his thing) are fleeting, in the later's case his part is much to small, in the former the long bloated runtime dillutes his appeal somewhatIs it an all together AWFUL film? Nope not really. It is what it is. Is it a vast disappointing outing for the series? YESD (me being generous)TLDR: Go on keep milking the franchise for every last drop and see how many of us say F it and merely wait for streaming.","

Fast X story is a bit choppy and all over the place and mostly repetitive and predictable. Actually it just looks like a bunch of random scenes put together with no real story. Oh and so many awesome actors with absolutely nothing to do. Then suddenly the movie just kind of ends with no warning?? That was strange.But this is the Fast and Furious and so there is lots and lots of car chases, lots of cameos and unbelievable and somewhat ridiculous car stunts and crashes.... And there is also Jason Momoa doing his best Joker. A bit too much for me.So what has happened to my Fast and Furious? I think I will go back and watch the original and forget I even watch this one.Cast - Vin Diesel, Jordana Brewster, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Momoa, John Cena, Jason Statham, Helen Mirren, Rita Moreno, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Sung Kang.","

"nb99","20 May 2023","Do you remember the game people used to play where someone would write down the first line of a story on a piece of paper, fold it back so the next person couldn't see it and then they'd add another line, fold it back etc. Then at the end you'd read the story in full and laugh at the results? Well I think that's how Fast X was written. It's a mish-mash of the previous 9 films rolled into one with cameo appearances from almost anyone who's ever starred in any of them. The problem is the story is nonsensical - we have jumps to shoots all around the world for no reason at all. We have a few maudlin scenes from the past. And of course (this is not a spoiler as it's now everywhere in the press) Fast X is not in fact the last film of the franchise so there is no closure of any sort at the end. The cast felt tired, going through the motions. I think even they think there's maybe been too many movies in this franchise. The only saving grace here was the wonderfully over the top villain played brilliantly by Jason Momoa - every scene he was in stood out.Yes there's the usual over the top stunts (though personally I thought not as good as some of the previous films) racing for no real point, fight scences etc so the fans of the franchise will probably enjoy it. But as a standalone film and even in comparison with the previous 9, it's a bit of a mess.","

"arabnikita","20 May 2023","Fast X (2023)The Fast and Furious franchise has become the topic of endless jokes whether it's the nonsensical plots, Bollywood rivalling action or the obsession with FaMiLy. While they did have their moments, after part 5, the reason why I watched these films was to roast the stupidity with my friends and hopefully to get some enjoyment out of it. Everytime I wondered what science defying spectacle they were going to shock me with but sadly this time, everything was rather normal by the standards of the franchise.In Fast X, the family of racers turned secret agents goes up against a new omnipotent villain named Dante who is a hybrid of Mugatu From Zoolander, Tom Hardy's Charles Bronson and Jared Leto's Joker. Dante is on a mission to make Dom suffer but over the course of the movie, it's the audience who ends up suffering the most. Unlike the predecessors, there weren't any cool elements, enjoyable fight sequences or laughable moments to make the experience worth suffering through. Considering that cars are a superpower of the franchise, there weren't enough car related sequences either.Even though there is an action sequence with blasting music every 5 minutes, I actually felt bored most of the time. On one side it's the general cacophony of the events and poor VFX while on the other, it's the lack of this logic defying craziness that I have come to expect. When I wasn't bored, I was cringing from the dialogue and painful head splitting humor. Oh, and when did John Cena go from a cold blooded murderer to a fun loving uncle?Fast X is a pure set up for the sequels as the story dashes between geographical locations while shoving too many characters and giving some of them around 3 minutes of screen time. I have obliterated the past 4 movies in my reviews but I have never been bored while watching them. It's neitehr grounded like the first four movies nor is it over-the-top like the next five. Better than Fast Nine but still hazardous to the human brain.Movieswithoutshmovies on Instagram for honest movie and TV reviews.","

"steveinadelaide","28 May 2023","I buckled up for the latest instalment in the adrenaline-fueled franchise, Fast X. Having previously enjoyed the well-made escapist nonsense of this franchise, I eagerly anticipated this action-packed joyride. But the reality falls short of the high-octane thrills and heart-racing moments we've enjoyed during this long-running, beloved series. Directed by a new visionary, Fast X struggles to find its footing, leaving me with a disjointed and lacklustre experience.Though intended to be the cornerstone of the film, the plot feels convoluted and overstuffed. The narrative attempts to tie up loose ends from previous entries, resulting in a tangled web of unresolved storylines and contrived twists. The themes of loyalty, family, and redemption, which once resonated deeply, are now lost amidst the chaos of overblown action sequences and cheesy dialogue.Unfortunately, the once-charismatic characters we've grown to love seem to be mere shadows of their former selves. The lacklustre performances by the ensemble cast dampen the film's impact, leaving me yearning for the chemistry and charisma that once made this franchise shine. The newcomers fail to make a lasting impression, and their interactions feel forced, lacking the organic camaraderie we expect from a Fast and Furious film.While attempting to inject fresh energy into the series, the direction falters in execution. The pacing is erratic, with frenetic action scenes abruptly juxtaposed with moments of forced sentimentality. The director's attempts to reinvent the franchise fall flat, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying experience.The score, cinematography, and production design, once standout elements of the Fast and Furious films, fail to leave a lasting impact. The familiar pulsating beats and slick visuals that defined the series are noticeably absent, replaced by generic choices that fail to elevate the overall experience. The special effects, too, lack the finesse and attention to detail we've come to expect, leaving action scenes feeling artificial and detached.The editing further exacerbates the film's issues with jarring cuts and questionable transitions. Scenes that should have heightened the tension instead fall flat, as the editing fails to maintain a cohesive flow. The dialogue, filled with clichés and uninspired one-liners, adds little depth to the already weak characterisations, leaving me longing for the witty banter and memorable lines that once made these films a guilty pleasure.While Fast X attempts to recapture the essence of what made this franchise a global phenomenon, it falls short in almost every aspect. As a viewer, I felt a palpable sense of disappointment, longing for the days when these films delivered heart-pounding action and captivating storytelling. It pains me to say that Fast X fails to leave a lasting impact, leaving me questioning the franchise's future.Fast X is a lacklustre entry in the series, struggling to find its place amidst a convoluted plot, underwhelming performances, and a misguided attempt at reinvention. Despite its best intentions, the film fails to deliver the thrills and emotional resonance that made its predecessors successful. Fast X is a forgettable and disjointed experience that falls far behind the high standards set by the franchise-strap in for a disappointing ride.","

"djrmc24","13 August 2023","It's been a long, wild, and whacky ride for the Fast and Furious Franchise but I think it has finally outstayed it's welcome. Where the first 3 or 4 Fast movies were a little grounded with realism, this latest entry is just completely off of the rails. Yes, I understand this is a film where you turn your mind off and just enjoy the action but c'mon! The plot in Fast X is so far fetched and the action set pieces just ignore all laws of gravity, that it's really hard to enjoy this film. Vin Diesel even seems to be phoning it in here. The only one who seems to understand the assignment is the newest Villian played by Jason Momoa who is absolutely ridiculous in a good way. Jason seemed to channel his Heath Ledger knock off impersenation here and for the most part it works. Also please be original and stop retconning events, it comes off being lazy. How this movie ends spells out that there will be another Fast film but why?! Hasn't 10 entries been enough already?! Fast X gets 3 low X's out of 10 from me.","

"Dannyboi94","11 June 2023","Ever since the Fast Five (in my opinion the best movie in the series), The Fast Franchise has taken a nosedive. It is now straight up ridiculous what this series has turned into. A street gang, is basically an army of unstoppable and invinsible soldiers. Seriously these people would probably survive a nucular blast - or a more likely scenario, Dom Tortetto would likely absorb the blast and shoot it from his eyeballs. It's gotten that absurd.While this movie is close to being an MCU movie, it is drastically better than the horrific previous movie, which made me rethink what a movie is. Fast X is pretty good for the most part, if you can switch off your brain and not take anything you see seriously at all.The story is as you would expect - bad, but it flows from point A to B which is good enough. The visual effects are great, the soundtrack is pretty good as well. But the clear standout here is Jason Momoa. His acting and character is a blast to watch. Every scene he's in, keeps your attention, because he brings a much needed fun and humorous vibe to this weird movie. Jason was clearly having fun here, because it translates to the screen. His crazy character was more compelling than most, if not all of the previous villains of the series combined. So the reason I am even giving this movie a 6, is solely because of Jason as Dante.Fast X ends of a stupid cliffhanger, but if we get to see more of Dante, I'm up for the next installment. Let's just hope thye don't stick to this trend of making villains heroes by the end, and killing off more people only to bring them back a few years later.","

"sergiodarocha","30 June 2023","''The Fast franchise is a film series that should have disappeared a long, long time ago.'' Someone wrote here. I think it's Vin Diesel that starts to get so annoying and so smug with the whole script around his character, the old same quotes and ''the family'' always being pronounced without any emotion capable of revealing the slightest talent as an actor.John Cena was an extra to help me follow the movie almost till the end. Jason Mamoa was very refreshing and devilishly funny. But both soon started to lose their characters in such script so poorly structured.Jason Statham would have done better than the ''star'' who persists in being the center of the attention of the world wich seems to be always against him.The script seems to have jumped from writer to writer with several sequences that seems to only serve to fill time and film, but without contributing much to the continuity and outcome of the story.A disappointment for anyone who would have expected something more exciting.","

"cardsrock","15 June 2023","I just feel depressed after seeing this film. Gone is any excitement I had for a franchise I used to sheepishly enjoy. Replaced is a never-ending cascade of recycled stunts, resurrected characters, and unbelievably lazy cliffhangers. They really should have stopped at 7 because they truly have nothing left to say. It's just the Vin Diesel show now in which he gets to hog half the screen time attempting to ""dramatically act."" He finally got his wish and wrestled away full control of this series from Lin and Morgan, AKA the brains behind the series' best entries.I just felt almost nothing during any of the ""tension-filled"" sequences. There are no stakes anymore and nothing matters. The cliffhanger certainly doesn't matter because you know it will get resolved in the first 5 minutes.There are a few bright spots. Jason Momoa does his best to breathe some Joker-like life into this lumbering franchise, but even his boisterous performance can't save this film. Cena teaming up with a youngster was fun to see, even though his character has basically an entirely different personality from his villain-turn in F9. Alan Ritchson is also a nice addition as he has some actual screen presence and charisma.You'll notice all my highlights are new additions to the franchise. That's part of my point. The original characters have nothing left to say or do. Roman and Tej's banter is just exhausting and cringey at this point. Same with Dom's speeches about family and his macho posturing. And while new typically equals better, Brie Larson's presence in this film is baffling and bizarre. She just shows up in some ridiculous outfits and jumps on cars for no apparent reason.I know these are meant to be brainless entertainment spectacles, but they used to at least have some semblance of plot and quality. The filmmakers act like they're in on the joke, but I can tell you Vin Diesel certainly isn't. He still thinks he's pumping out high quality billion dollar grossers, and that is just simply not true. I can't believe we have two more films in this now THREE PART finale.","

"FixedYourEnding","16 June 2023","In Fast X, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) must protect his family from Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa / Aquaman), who seeks revenge for his father's death and the loss of his family's fortune. Dante is revealed to be the previously unknown son of Hernan Reyes, from 2011's ""Fast Five,"" and there is a homage to ""Fast Five"" in the opening safe-stealing scene, which is the best, and possibly the only, 5 minutes worth watching out of this 2+ hours movie.Let me put it straight up front - Fast X is NOT a good movie. Other than the soundtrack that has some nice tracks in it, everything else is either amateurish, in the good case, or absolutely insulting at its worst. Starting from a horrible camera job, through ridiculous CGI scenes, over to plastered acting and useless dialogue, ending in a forgettable and boring story that will challenge you to sit through it, even if you enjoy all the explosions and matchbox-style cars moving around in countless impossible ways. The arguably best character, Dante, is very quickly becomes annoying and laughable.Now let's be honest, the F&F franchise was never known for physical accuracy, it presented flying cars ties to a hook wire, jumping over bridges and multitude of other stunts. However there is one point where too much is just too much, especially if the big budget is thrown at getting big names instead of getting a good production company that can get the top-notch visuals that a movie like that should have, and hire some writers that actually take pride in their job.According to a report from The Wrap, the budget for Fast and Furious 10 was an eye-watering $340 million, the largest in the series. On the flip side, it made $320 million worldwide, so it will be a break-even endeavor. I wish it has lost $300 million, maybe that will bring an end to movies like that, that their entire purpose is to create lines of viewers that look at the impressive roster of actors (don't forget 4 of them previous Oscar winners) but did not wait to read the reviews beforehand.I was not one of the people that formed a line in the theater for a movie like that. For your sake and the future sake of the industry, I implore you not to be one of these, and please don't do that for the unavoidable Fast 11, just wait for the small screen. I was a big fan of the franchise at it first steps, but this movie turned me into a hater. Seriously. Exact score: 41 / 100.","

Vin Diesel is bulletproof with only a jeans sleeveless jacket/vest, who actually doesn't love all of his family equally (shocking!).The first three were something new, after that is just milking the money cow, i.e. Brainwashing stupid people into watching.The only good part of this movie is Momoa's acting which actually stayed the same, while others' just got worse and more cheesy.And the worst part you may ask? There's going to be ANOTHER movie! Talk about an ending... A sub... Are they going to dive to Titanic and pull it up to the surface to sell it to regain the lost money?!

"Braga_HK","9 June 2023","Does it live up to the hype?Unfortunately, the answer is no. Fast X is a disappointing and nonsensical mess that fails to entertain or impress. The plot is thin and convoluted, the characters are bland and forgettable, and the logic is nonexistent. The film relies on cheap CGI, unrealistic physics, and ridiculous coincidences to create its spectacle, but it only succeeds in creating eye-rolling moments and disbelief.The film's biggest flaw is its lack of realism and consistency. The film expects us to believe that Dominic Toretto and his team can survive anything, from driving down stairs, to jumping out of planes, to falling off dams, without a scratch. They can also outrun and outsmart the police, the military, and a global terrorist organization with ease. They can hack into any system, use any weapon, and drive any vehicle with no training or preparation. They can also defy the laws of nature, such as gravity, momentum, and thermodynamics, with their cars and gadgets.The film also expects us to care about the characters and their relationships, but it fails to develop them or give them any depth. The film introduces characters, such as Jakob Toretto (Dominic's long-lost brother) and Gisele (a former ally who was presumed dead), but they are poorly written and acted. The film also brings back characters, such as Cipher (the main villain from the previous film) and Letty (Dominic's wife), but they are reduced to clichés and stereotypes. The film tries to create drama and tension between them, but it feels forced and artificial.The film also tries to be funny and witty, but it falls flat. The film's humor relies on lame jokes, awkward banter, and childish insults that are not funny or clever. The film also tries to be cool and badass, but it comes off as cheesy and cringy. The film's soundtrack is generic and forgettable, the dialogue is corny and predictable, and the action scenes are over-the-top and boring.Fast X is a waste of time and money. It is a poorly made film that insults the intelligence and taste of its audience. It is a film that should be avoided by anyone who values quality cinema or entertainment. It is a film that deserves a rating of 1 out of 10 stars.","

"jtindahouse","17 May 2023","Admittedly I hadn't seen of these 'Fast' movies in a long time, but I'm not crazy am I - the cast wasn't always this strong, was it? There is a truly insane lineup of stars in this movie, and somehow the movie finds a way to give every one of them a purpose.Jason Momoa as the bad guy is worth mentioning as being terrific. He looked like he had a lot of fun with the role. It seemed like he was given a lot of leeway to do as he pleased and he used it wisely. He actually gave me a lot of 'Joker' vibes.The film is long at 2 hours and 21 minutes, but it's a rare time when I felt the film could absolutely justify it. For one thing the pacing is incredible and time really does fly by. For another thing there is so much going on and so many cast members who need time to do their thing that it was absolutely necessary. Actually the fact they were able to cut the run time down to only this was an accomplishment.The action scenes and the story are as outrageous as we have come to expect from this series. It's at the point now where you simply have to sit back, switch your mind off and enjoy the ride. And to be honest it's pretty easy to do with this film. I had a great time. 8/10.","

"chris_rowe-881-168820","25 May 2023","This film felt just about Vin Diesel telling the world how great he is, telling himself he's the best and that this franchise hasn't been irrelevant for atleast 5 years. The self grandeur and narcissism by a guy who is running a franchise into the ground and making it more of a joke out of a legitimate fear now guardians is done, he won't get any big roles.Rightly so, let's say the truth, the guy cannot act, there were so many close ups of his face looking for reaction/emotion, there was none, you could've switched it for a baked potato with googly eyes and gotten more. His voice is almost grating, it's so mumbling and slow, plus the dialogue, this film must set a world record for the use of ""family"". It's legitimately cringe and the reasoning is because they cannot justify keep making these films.The only other 2 I'm not a huge fan of in this are Natalie and Terese, I like Natalie but she just doesn't click with these characters and her delivery isn't the best, her line ""oh I know stuff now"" was just ridiculous, she's talented but not right and hasn't really fit in since she came in. The last acting one was Tyrese, it's interesting the two that fell out with Rock, the second desperately tried to be comic relief and failed, completely terrible at portray the fun guy of the group. The rest were average to good. Always great to see Jason.JM was brilliant and only reason this was a 4 and not a 2, he was silly, fun and enjoyable and kind of saved this movie by playing into the stupidity whilst Vin tries to be serious. Can we also acknowledge that Vin diesel although in good shape hasn't got a top tier physique, so there's no need to purposefully hold his arms wide like a silverback looking for territory, especially when atleast 2 on the film make you look skinny. Again vanity.The action is fine, there's a difference between entertaining and good, the stuff is fun to watch but when it gets too ludicrous it just becomes a bit boring, especially when it's one guy mainly doing the ridiculous. The story was ok, how they did the start was very good though, kinda down hill from there, the tie ins were clever to.Won't spoil anything, I went into this thinking it was the last one and the ending I was like ""huh"" to then find out 1 but potentially 2 more parts are coming is absolutely stupid. 3 films to wrap up this? If anyone thinks it's anything other than Bin desperately trying to keep it alive so his rotten ability doesn't end his career is deluded. That's why every issue, he's involved, if he legitimately thought this was good, it's embarrassing. His performance ruined it, if there was less of him and more of the others then yeah this could actually be fun! It's being kept on life support by a narcissist and means the franchise will end as a joke which people want to die instead of what it could've been or what it was when it started. I knew when PW died that when it didn't end because of that, the only way it ends is when Vin says! Let this sink in 2027 will likely be the third, he will be 60! Ridiculous.","

It is exhausting to see so much action. I get that is the the formula to make box office success but still thinking that there is a better way to make highly dynamic scenes and to balance the whole movie with meaningful plot and dialogues. This big ball-bomb scene in Rome reminded me of a game that I used to play with similar but smaller ball that you had to move to the end. Anyways. A lot of chewed topics. A lot of cringe. Unsuccessful villain and hoping he doesn't become one of the good ones in the future movies. Honestly hoping there isn't any new parts of this torture.","

"jamesfirass","14 June 2023","""Fast and Furious X"" incorporates Bollywood cliches and Bollywood Physics to create an over-the-top, action-packed experience. The film embraces the exaggerated and larger-than-life elements commonly found in Bollywood movies, which may appeal to fans of the genre. However, the movie's heavy reliance on these cliches and exaggerated physics can hinder the overall viewing experience for those seeking a more realistic or grounded film.The plot of ""Fast and Furious X"" likely follows a similar pattern to previous installments of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, with a focus on high-speed car chases, daring stunts, and extravagant action sequences. The storyline might involve a group of charming and charismatic protagonists, a love triangle, and family drama, all of which are common tropes in Bollywood films.In terms of the action sequences, the film may take liberties with physics, featuring gravity-defying car jumps, impossible maneuvers, and unrealistic feats of strength and agility. These exaggerated physics are intended to create a sense of awe and entertainment, but they may stretch the boundaries of believability even within the realm of Bollywood cinema.While ""Fast and Furious X"" may entertain fans of Bollywood movies and those who appreciate over-the-top action and exaggerated physics, it might not resonate as strongly with viewers seeking a more grounded or realistic cinematic experience.","

"and_mikkelsen","19 May 2023","Yeah! His character and performance was without a doubt the best part of the movie! He steals every scene he is in and whenever he is around, the movie is just a little bit better! Kind of like when Dwayne Johnson stole the show in Fast 5 and Jason Statham stole the show in Furious 7!Sometimes all you need in these kind of movies is an over the top evil, insane villain that just does whatever he wants and enjoys everything he is doing! Overall his inclusion helped the movie as it rose the stakes and made everything more personal and dire as we are in the endgame now!The movie also has some great action but not completely ridiculous or out of this world like cars flying in space!The last part of the movie was really good and the cliffhanger ending made me excited for the next fast movie! Something I wasn't efter the last movie!","

"Silicone54","14 June 2023","With many a-list actors and a whole crew of b-list supporting cast no wonder they could only afford to do most of the movie in studio. A majority of the scenes were bizarrely dull and sterile. There was no way to avoid noticing the flat appearance of the sets.The CGI scenes of the chase scenes were plain awful. While they may excite a 7 year old most adults have seen much better special effects. The bombing of the dam was the most ridiculous scene. I've never knew an explosion could cause lava like flames to chase a car down a straight wall. I remember something weird science like heat rises?Jason Momoa's character was kind of irritating because he's supposed to be flamboyantly gay maybe? He and John Cena were the only memorable actors. The rest of the cast were lost in a big whirlwind of car chases.This is Fast & Furious so don't expect an actual story. Its all about cars and explosions. Unfortunately, too many actors salaries and little cash left for real sets made this difficult to enjoy.","

"guybarnes-16389","11 August 2023","Ahhhh furious, you've come along way from innocent street races in the streets of La, fast 9 was hilariously ridiculous and fast X did not disappoint, from the extra cheese family moments and con disels stiff acting like he's apart of a 90's family day time drama, to the bomb that gets found by ludcris that twice the size of the atomic of bomb in the back of the truck that gets loose in the streets of Rome that sets a light and then becomes a rocket league match, Jason mamoas frivilous evil play boy routine and eastwoods line where he's comparing not being able to swipe right on hand profile because the network is down really sets the tone, It's hard to make Charlize Theron bad but fast x delivers! Great watch on a Friday night for a laugh with friends! Definitely recommend.","

"henrik_piano","25 August 2023","I remember when I laughed at Fast 1 for 31 speed gearbox and a quarter mile drag race being 10 miles and a 100 technical nonsense. When I thought Fast IX was so bad it makes Transformers seem intellectual, they somehow manage to go lower. I started groaning at the first car chase. After that it's all downhill.The overall plot is *ahem* fair I guess. You have probably figured out that Jason Mamoa is after Dom & co. More than that is hard to explain without starting to give away spoilers or, more so, start raving about the gargantuan plot holes. James Bond has nothing on Fast X in terms of ""WTF's"". Marvel superheroes? HA! Sissys in comparison! So what spoilers you think if the story is so bad? Well there are a few but they're only surprises because of the lack of any sense of logic.By now you're probably wondering why I didn't give it just one star? There are a few minuscule savings graces. 1) Jason Mamoa makes a descent villain/psycho. Not Hannibal Lecter class but far from bad under the circumstances. 2) The cars. I'm a sucker for old muscle cars and there's plenty of them.I was hoping that this would be the end as Vin Diesel first said but it's obviously not and even if I have a free viewing next time as well I'll spend my time on something more interesting. Knitting perhaps...","

"sscmst","26 July 2023","Can someone please explain how Little B is now black, when neither parent is and when he was introduced in Furious 7 (or 8, can't remember), he was most definitely white??? WTH???Also, read the story synopsis and this movie sounds SO confusing (glad I read that, now I won't waste my money). It talked about villains and stories from earlier F&F movies and honestly, I can't keep up with all the characters/villians. And what's the story with constantly bringing people back from the dead (Han? Gisele?). That gets really old really fast and just not believable (just like a car jumping between buildings in Abu Dabi) 🙄
Now, Vin Diesel says there will be a Fast 11?? When will this all end?? When they are all racing each other in wheelchairs??","

"TomTalksFilms","19 May 2023","You know when a director like Tarantino or Nolan put out a new film and you've had to wait a while so it's a big event..... Anyway this is my review for Fast X . It feels like we've had a new fast and furious movie every two years for forever and at this post nothing is off the table in terms of balls to wall action and stunt work. Fast 9 may have gone up high into space however I think most people are in unanimous agreement that it was a new low for the franchise, despite this the film did well at the box office and well here we are with a 10th instalment and it's more of the same. The story is simple, the villain of the film Dante (Jason Momoa) isn't too happy about something that happened in one of the previous films (no he didn't just waste his time like I did by watching fast 9) and so he's decided to not just kill but make Dom and Co suffer because 'never accept death when suffering is owed'🧀. This leads to the usual over the top action fiasco which we go to see these films for as Dom and Co try to defend themselves. Groups of characters end up getting split up and have their own plot lines however despite there being a lot going on in the film it still feels empty and not several hours after coming out of the cinema I've forgotten most of the sideline plots. Some of the characters also get more screen time than others which could disappoint people who have favourites. That could all be forgiven if the action is good right? As after all that's what people are going to these films to for. The first 90 mins I was throughly enjoying this film, there's a bit of build up then a big action scene (the best in the film) but then it calms down after that and really tries to delve into what little plot there is which really didn't work me. I also felt a lot of the action scenes were spoilt as if you've seen any of the trailers then you can pretty much piece together exactly what happens in the full film. The only thing that was a surprise was the mid credits scene which is worth sticking around for. The first half of this film is enough to make it not the worst in the franchise however it's far from the best and Fast and Furious definitely feels like a franchises who's best days are behind it. As we brace ourselves for two more of these films I suggest we take a deep breath and think happy thoughts of Oppenheimer.... Actually that sounds a bit wrong 😬.","

"Danula_Balasooriya","17 June 2023","Fast X, the latest installment in the highly popular Fast & Furious franchise, unfortunately falls short of its predecessors. This action-packed spectacle, disappointingly, is not worth watching for fans or newcomers.One of the major setbacks of Fast X lies in its weak and unoriginal storyline. The plot lacks depth and fails to engage viewers on any meaningful level. It follows a predictable and formulaic structure, offering no surprises or innovative twists. The narrative appears to be a mere excuse to string together a series of action sequences, ultimately leaving audiences craving for more substance.The acting performances in Fast X also leave much to be desired. Despite the presence of a talented cast, their abilities are underutilized, resulting in lackluster performances. The characters feel one-dimensional and fail to connect with the audience emotionally. This lack of depth hampers any potential investment in the story or its protagonists.While the film does showcase a few noteworthy action sequences, they pale in comparison to the exhilarating set pieces that fans have come to expect from the Fast & Furious franchise. These moments offer temporary excitement, but they are not enough to salvage the overall viewing experience. Fast X lacks the awe-inspiring stunts and jaw-dropping spectacles that have become synonymous with the series.Inevitably, comparisons arise between Fast X and its predecessors. Unfortunately, this latest installment falls far short of the high standards set by the original Fast & Furious movies. The charm, charisma, and camaraderie that made the franchise a global phenomenon seem sorely absent in Fast X. It fails to capture the essence that endeared fans to the series in the first place.In conclusion, Fast X disappoints on multiple fronts. With a lackluster story, underwhelming acting, and only a few redeeming action sequences, it fails to make a lasting impression. As a fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, it is disheartening to see this latest entry miss the mark. I would recommend revisiting the original films rather than investing time in Fast X.","

"mohsinrr","16 September 2023","Here we go again with the family and the cars and men in there late 40s and 50s solving problems by driving irresponsibly. The movie felt like it kept on going and going with no end in sight. Super weak plot, random actors being thrown in at random points in the movie to keep audience interested, clearly no one was even slightly phased. With regards to car stunts, they felt weak or may be we have seen them all so there is no """"ooooh that was sick"" moment. Even the souped up cara that are the focal point of this series lacked performance. I better not see ads for any more of these movies... but I feel like they will reignite the series with brand new cast as they kept referring to ""the next generation"". Stop... please just stop.","

"mohnomachado","18 June 2023","Fast X is one ridiculous ride that requires you to turn your brain off, and then voluntarily proceed to lose brain cells in order for it to be effective. Mamoa tries his best with a laughable script, but this is a mess of a movie to say the least. I'm not kidding when I say one of the plot points is that Mamoa's character wants to blow up Vatican City. His reasoning is simple: cuz why not. And honestly that was one of the more understandable character motivations in this movie. Vin Diesel and the rest of the cast just look tired at this point. I will say that some of the locations were nice to look at, but I'd give this one a hard pass. If you want to save your time, watch Fast Five and call it a day.","

"kjproulx","19 May 2023","The Fast & Furious franchise is one that I have been following since the first film back in 2001. I always give this franchise the benefit of the doubt. I have at least liked all of the movies, even loved a couple of them, that was until F9 in 2021. It has now become a thing to expect that these films will try and outdo the previous installment in terms of insanity, but F9 truly felt like they took everything all the fans had been joking about and just did it all. It went beyond ridiculous to even enjoy. Thankfully, now that Fast X has hit theatres and I had the chance to check it out, it has put the franchise back on track for me, even if it is still almost too ridiculous (stupid might actually be a better word, but in a good way).Directly connected to the events of Fast Five, Fast X picks up ten years later, as the emergence of Dante (Jason Momoa) begins. He is the son of the man they robbed and killed in Fast Five, so obviously he wants revenge. It's actually pretty seamless how they tie it all into that film, reusing old footage and adding new. My only issue with this storyline is that it took ten years for Dante to actually seek the revenge he wanted. Sure, let's just roll with it because if you don't, you'll probably hate the rest of this film too. People have come to expect the ridiculous here, as I said, so as long as that's what you go into this film looking for, you may just be as satisfied as I was.The bombastic action sequences are once again dialled up to a million, but it was nice to see an actual race sequence, even though it felt a little short. The main reason to see this film though, if you're a fan or not, is Jason Momoa. His performance here may just be my favourite of everything I've seen him in. The flamboyance he exudes had me laughing and fearing for the crew all at the same time. I enjoyed the entire cast as always, but Momoa just stood out over everyone else here.I should also mention that you shouldn't be expecting a completed story. Fast X is clearly the start of a bigger storyline to come, as the film ends fairly abruptly with no resolution at all. Almost in an Avengers: Infinity War style, I really want to see what comes next. There are quite a few promises in this film that excite me, so I'll remain optimistic for an awesome conclusion. Let's be real though, Fast X is very, very stupid.This film doesn't hold back in throwing the impossible at you. From Dom flipping over a car with one arm to driving down a dam Hot Wheels-style, it's absolutely bonkers. Again though, it felt like a breath of fresh air compared to the lunacy that happened in F9. Nobody stays dead in this franchise either. There are some big surprises throughout the film, but I'm still not sure how I feel about one of them in particular. It borders on ruining storylines from the past, so there better be a nice explanation in the subsequent movie. Look, I had a great time watching this stupid film with characters I've grown to love, so sue me for reviewing it positively. It has fully embraced everything anyone has ever said about this franchise, so at this point, you should know what you're getting yourself into. If you like these films and are up to date, I say check it out. I had a blast.","

"MaheshPanth","18 May 2023","I just don't like the story. These two stars are only for the action shown in the film. Yeah, if you want to test your patience and keep your brain behind, you can go check out this movie. But, just on the basis of action only, I don't find it entertaining at all. Overall, complete boring film. If there were no bigger stars used in the movie, this would have been a total flop. They sold this movie just on the basis of star power and some action scenes only. I don't know what to write next. I am totally disappointed. The makers invested so much money on the stars and graphics but the movie could have been a lot better if they invested one fourth of the money into a better writer. In the theatre, I was like, how do I even complete this movie? I might offend a lot of fans but personally, I find this movie boring. Maybe, my taste is different to what people see in the west but I watch movies for story. Action, it's cool. But, I can still watch a movie full if there's no action but the story is engaging and interesting. This story I just saw in Fast X, I have seen it many times already, just a slight changes and nothing new. As a movie lover, I didn't enjoyed this movie. Still, hats off to the team behind action scenes. They are the only one who deserve appreciation.","

"themoviedude_2000","20 May 2023","My favorite part of the movie is at the end when the dam exploded and Dominic looks right at the camera, breaking the 4th wall, and says, ""it's a good thing it's Toretto Tuesday"" then puches the water back into the river with his fists then gets into his Charger and does a series of donuts to make another dam saving the nearby village from disaster. The dance number in the credits was amazing as well.Can't wait for the next three to end the series. I don't think this one can be topped however. The water punching and the lasers are going to be hard to beat.Again, the ""It's Toretto Tuesday"" line is amazing.","

"shenamere","23 June 2023","The racy background music starts once the pop music ends. Fortunately, no expletives are endlessly repeated. I guess the movie wants to maintain its PG rating. Fast X plays out like a story line created by 13 year olds. And then, and then, and then. It is SO predictable. The product placements, the locations, the bad CGI, the lame ""acting"" are just good enough to make it an OK movie for a rainy day. Poor Rome, or at least what is supposed to be Rome. The ""go-to"" place for trying-to-be-trendy movies. This isn't a Bond movie and there certainly isn't any class happening by Ian Fleming standards. Why are all the caucasian characters looking as though they have been gilded? The fake tans are just cheap. The heavy eye liner makes the female characters look like racoons. But then again, the movie is clearly targeted to the 10 - 15 year old set and there must be a video game or something to keep up with the score.","

I understand it will continue on in the next movie but so many characters just vanished from the movie without any indication that that would be the last you'd see of them in this movie. And I honestly don't get all the reviews saying Jason Mamoa carries this movie, because he doesn't. His character is such a disaster, he seems to start off as a fairly normal villain then suddenly starts acting and dressing like a 12 year old girl. I honestly thought the franchise couldn't get any worse after fast 9, but boy, was I wrong. Theyre honestly just flogging a dead horse with this franchise now. Completely disappointing.","

"masonsaul","19 May 2023","At this point in the franchise you know exactly what you're getting with a new Fast and Furious film. A previous film will be retconned in some way to make it even more hilariously convoluted, the family will get even larger and whole thing will act like the biggest and dumbest B-movie telenovela currently going.Judged against the other F&F films though, Fast X improves quite a bit over F9, fixing a fair few problems with a superior antagonist and a tighter run time. Even though it struggles to give all of its characters something to do it remains a great blockbusters that's unashamedly silly, loads of fun and gets the franchise into its endgame in satisfying fashion.Vin Diesel gets to show a lighter side to Dom early on that's really sweet before returning to the usual overly serious presence that still works. John Cena is way better here, finally allowed to play to his comedic strengths and his adventure with Leo. A Perry is the most enjoyable subplot of the movie.The standout performance is easily Jason Momoa. He's by far one of the best villains of the whole franchise and possibly the best. So flamboyant, playful and clearly having an absolute blast. Really leaning into his characters insanity and giving the Fast franchise its equivalent of the Joker.Louis Leterrier's direction is really good, he keeps the multiple subplots moving along nicely and overall brings a mobility to the film that avoids it feeling overly familiar or stale. There's also a nice Transporter 2 reference that proves he was an inspired to choice to make one of these as it fits in perfectly with their over the top nature.The CG looks really cartoonish once again and just like last time it kinda works in its favour and makes every set piece even funnier in its absurdity. The music by Brian Tyler carries over everything that was created in the previous score as well as bringing back the themes that were sorely missed in that one.","

"FlashCallahan","21 May 2023","Over many missions, jumping numerous sharks, and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto and his family have outsmarted and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they must confront the most lethal............and campest opponent they've ever faced. Fueled by revenge, and nail polish, a terrifying threat emerges from the shadows of the past to shatter Dom's world and destroy everything -- and everyone -- he loves. It's all about family you know.....The fast and furious franchise is a wonder of creation. The first movie was nothing more than a remake of Point Break, and the first two sequels were pretty bland. But then something almost miracle like happened. From the fourth movie being released and removing the word 'the' they just kept getting bigger, and earning stupendous amounts of money in the process. This never happened to Police Academy......After the decidedly dodgy Fast 9, I thought the franchise has finally ran out of gas (or petrol if you're from the UK). But obviously they knew that number nine was terrible, and decided to go back to the formula that made 5-8 so enjoyable. And love or hate this franchise, its a hoot from start to finish.The script is terrible, and if you take a drink anytime someone says family, you'd be up to your neck in empty Corona bottles. But it's so big, so stupid, so action packed, you cannot help but be pulled into the whole thing. If, like me, you were brought up on a diet of Annie, Stallone, Van Damme, And Seagal, big and silly films are mothers milk to me.The plot is basically Momoa mugging and chewing scenery whilst threatening Dom and crew in the campest way possible. And that's the plot. The gang split into groups to cover more ground and set pieces, and familiar faces pop up every now and again, just to remind you that they are part of the franchise. We get new characters with Brie Larson and Jack Reacher, and to help them, they have a scene where they literally watch clips from the previous films, and it's fine, because it's silly, but somehow absolutely fine.The action is big and as silly as ever, but it's fine, because it's Fast and Furious, and fans of it will lap it up, because they are fans. WE are fans. Non-fans of the franchise won't like it, but they will pay good money to see it and not like it, because some people are just like that.There are a few minor quibbles. Sometimes the effects are god-awful, especially the green screen, and for a film with a budget of $340 million, that could have been avoided. And Diesel looks like he's been de-aged in some parts, especially at the beginning when he is talking to his son.But aside from that, it's a fun night at the movies, and fans won't be disappointed. It's not for everyone, but hey, it is what it is.And there is a wonderful mid-credit sequence, which has been spoiled by everybody, but it's still pretty brilliant.","

"nscoby93","19 May 2023","Part 1 to the conclusion of the Fast and Furious franchise is just bad.I'll make this quick because I don't care to write too much about this film.This movie has no narrative structure, jumps around from a group of characters to a group of characters, with some of these groups serving no purpose to the ""plot."" I use that term loosely because there isn't one.This latest installment in the franchise is like all the bad Marvel films wrapped into one movie with some cool things sprinkled around, and note I say cool, not good things.But it's Fast and Furious. Nobody shows up to a F&F movie for intricate plots and groundbreaking storytelling. We show up for fast cars, action, explosions, fast cars again, and hot chicks.And that is exactly what holds this assault to the senses film up, cool, ridiculous, over the type, and explosions that could almost make Michael Bay blush.Then what gives this movie that extra point and this is 100% a personal thing, but my girl who I thought would never return to the F&F franchise made a five second appearance, and I lost it! I swear I will fanboy over this woman til the day I die. I refuse to say who as to avoid spoilers.Anyway Fast X was everything I anticipated it to be at this point with the Fast franchise over the top, and ridiculous, but even that can't save a poor script, bad writing, and horrible storytelling.IMDb: 3/10

The bad man in this movie (Dante - Jason Momoa) is showing himself happy, trying to be funny, dancing and moving as a comedian. Such acting is not acceptable because this movie is action movie with sad story, we see poor kid. There isn't genre Comedy for this movie.Technically movie looks well, i mean there are explosions, many locations in the world, driving etc. But all this doesn't mean anything to me because Dante's behavior is bad. Another bad part in this movie is that mission for saving kind isn't over, looks like boss of this movie making company wants to create Fast Y.","

Don't they have special forces? So yeah, lower your expectations because I'm glad I did. And it turns out to be more fun that expected. Hear me out, the movie still lacks of logical explanation for its action scenes. Physicists will cry watching this movie. Put your logic aside and watch it for fun, it's great. Jason Momoa's character was surprisingly good! The villain's plan was so much more malicious than previous ones. The soundtracks, like usual, does not disappoint. Cinematography is nice as well!

If you've been along for the ride this far, why would you find anything to moan about now? It all got super silly a fair while ago and if you've decided to stick with it as it gets siller by the episode...well, you get what I'm saying, right?The nonsense inherent in the franchise means that people pop up out of nowhere at the drop of a hat - even characters that have been dead for a number of previous outings! - and characters do inexplicable things for incomprehensible reasons but that's all par for the course and you either buy into it or you don't. I do, and I therefore love these movies for what they are - BIG DUMB FUN!The addition this time out of the scenery chewing villainy of Jason Momoa and Brie Larson as Mr. Nobody/Kurt Russel's daughter work well as do the fun cameos - no spoilers here! - so no complaints from me. Go to the theatre intent on having fun and i promise you that you will. Don't and you probably won't. It's nup to you....","

There is Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) ""talking about the importance of family"".Jason Momoa (Dante) plays his character like an ott Austin Power/Dr Evil but straight faced. The number of cameo appearances may be the best part of this movie & guessing who will appear is a game one can make. This is providing you do not cheat and look at the credits for the answers The storyline is basic but serviceable. It takes a back seat to the action, car chases and explosion scenes.Just like my review, that is just writing enough to meet the character requirements, this film is full of fillers that tick off all the requirements that ""make an action film"". So don't expect this to be a genre changing film and enjoy this as it is: just another fast and furious film.","

"DanMovieReview","12 August 2023","There a saying for this movie:""you can do a bad movie out of a good script, but you cannot do a good movie out of a bad script.""What about when there is no script at all, only a story board of different action sequence that could look cool?I wish I could tell the story is utterly stupid, or made absolutely no sense, but that would imply there is story to begin with! I have absolutely no idea what is going on. It seems the movie just jump to one exotic location to another. How the most wanted people on earth made it to Rome to Rio de Janiro to Portugal to Antartica to L. A. without being arrested? Don't know! Don't care!Vin Diesel is a terrible actor without any range of acting. The only facial expression he can display is a dumb face. He is probably wondering what the hell is going on, where the hell he is, and how could a studio could pour 300 million into his project!The movie is packed with disposable low level vilains that pop out of nowhere, without any type of context, just to get their ass kicked by one or some of the protagonists.I forgot to mention, the law of physics don't apply here. Same for the protagonists. None of them can really get hurt. So, there is really nothing at stake or worth carring in this ""movie"".Jason Momoa is probably the only good thing this movie have. I wish that he is given the chance to play a vilain again in a good movie.","

"rannynm","22 May 2023","Fast X is an unabashed next step in this series' mission to depict escalating vehicular mania. It's certainly enjoyable and even thrilling at points, but it does lack some novelty. As Fast X speeds the Fast and Furious franchise into its final lap, it can't help but feel like we're going in circles.Fast X follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) as they raise their son away from their enemies and the battles that have taken up much of their time for decades. Dominic's friends and soldiers of the wheel-Roman (Tyrese Gibso), Tej (Ludacris), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) -all go on a mission to Rome, Italy, for an underground government organization. However, the mission isn't real and both the agency and Dom's pals are duped by an old foe that emerges from the shadows to exact revenge on Dom and his family. This villain, Dante (Jason Momoa), threatens to break Dom's family into pieces, so the family must figure out how to save themselves from Dante and new government agents who have Dom in their crosshairs.These Fast and Furious characters used to steal TVs off of moving trucks-now they save the Vatican. These movies succeed most when they know what they are and what you want. It's a rollercoaster, so at a certain point you just throw your hands up and enjoy the ride. Dominic Toretto is basically inhuman by now; nothing can kill him and he can bend the laws of reality and science to his will. Action is the primary draw of these films-story has become secondary as the saga of Dom and his band of street racers turned superheroes cruises into its 11th entry. Fast X, however, goes all in on plot, which feels like a miscalculation. Especially as the second half refuses to reach any kind of conclusion, barreling towards a silly cliffhanger that does little to maintain the stakes the first half establishes. None of the racers we've come to know and love are safe, but the way Fast X wraps up, it's hard not to feel like all of them are.Jason Momoa is unbelievable in this movie as Dante. He's easily the best villain Dom and the crew have ever fought against. This level of gleeful, over-the-top evil is hard to find in any movie, but it's a gift in the heightened world of Fast and Furious. He gets all the movie's best laughs-you almost wish he would crush Dominic's world so we could watch him laugh, twirl, and dance as it all goes up in flames. John Cena's a lot of fun, too. He takes a page from Momoa's playbook, an action hero who loses the self-seriousness and has a good time playing uncle to Dom's young son. Tyrese Gibson is ever a delight as Roman. Gibson always has a lot fun with this role, and he understands exactly what energy he must bring to keep the franchise full of life. Practically every time he comes on screen, the audience erupts into laughter.I give Fast X 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, for some language, frequent intense action and some graphic violence. Fast X zooms into theaters on May 19, 2023. Vroom vroom. By Benjamin P., KIDS FIRST!","

"ash_dunn","8 June 2023","This film is one of the best comedies I have seen in years, except it's not a comedy. The writers must have some seriously good drugs to have come up with this film.By now, we are so far from the first film about street racers who are thieves - which was a bad rip off of the original Point Break.It is non stop (ridiculous) action from start to finish and it gets very tedious. Part way through the film in between the action scenes I started thinking about the scene from Dude Where's My Car, when they are at the drive through - ""And then?"" I mean it really is, a ridiculous scene, and then a ridiculous scene.The other issue with the movie is that the cast is so big that no one really has much screen time and when they do, for some, there's no need for it.At this point in the series of films, I think every character who was killed off previously, is miraculously alive.I couldn't really work out Jason Momoas character and to be fair, I was sort of beyond caring after about 20 minutes. Alan Ritchson, who I liked in Reacher, is wasted in this film.The scenes with Jon Cena and his car with what looks like rockets, but I think are homemade cannons is dumb and genuinely I thought they were stealing a renowned Darwin Award story, thankfully they haven't.Ten films in, yes we know it's about family, but this is the most dysfunctional, hybrid family in existence.If you want to part with your hard earned cash, don't want to think, don't care about the plot and genuinely want to watch one of the worst films ever made, this might be for you.","

"D4V1D2411","8 June 2023","I dont know how to feel about this movie, on one side I know I shouldnt take it seriously because it only wants to entertain you for a while and it kinda accomplishes that, but on the other hand, its just not that good of an action movie and even in comparison to its other films, it loses in almost every aspect. The few good things of this movie and the ones it shines in comparison to the other Fast movies, is in its villain, I personally still prefer the shaw brothers a villains, but Jason Momoa brings a different air to the saga and his interpretation is really funny, but this action movie definitely doesnt deliver on the action sequences, it tries to make them bigger and better but given the previous history of absurdity this movies have already gone through, they feel a little boring and not special. I had a little fun time watching it but I dont think I will be watching it ever again.","

"mitchell5954","27 May 2023","Fast X is the latest in the Fast and Furious franchise. It is also the first in the franchise to end on a cliffhanger. This caught me off-guard in the theater. I had no idea this would be the first of a two-parter. In seems like they're going for a Marvel/Harry Potter sort of finale. Every entry in this franchise since Fast Five felt like it would be the last one, yet it wasn't. Here we might actually be entering the endgame, which I hope we are. These guys aren't getting any younger, and the franchise has been in danger of becoming stale for the last couple entries.I've been a fan of this series since Fast Five. I like the first and fourth films okay, but it was the first one that really drew me in. Furious Six is actually my personal favorite. Seven and eight are okay, as well as Hobbs and Shaw. F9 I like, though not as much as some of the others, mainly due to the absence of The Rock.At this point, you should know what you're in for with these movies. These movies are not high art. They're pure popcorn entertainment. There's a bit of character development to keep you invested, but mainly these films are about the spectacle. If you're a critic watching the tenth Fast move complaining it's not an Oscar caliber drama you need to get your priorities straight. They're about nice cars, fan service, the themes of family and honor, a catchy soundtrack, great effects and cinematography, nice locations, and of course fun, high-octane, ludicrous action set pieces (pun intended).Fast X hits all of those beats. Although, none of the action ever reaches the same level of craziness as the previous film. That's another reason why I hope this franchise ends after the next film. We are now at the escalation problem. Each entry has continuously escalated the stakes and action. In the last film they went into space. Short of an alien invasion, there really isn't anywhere left for this franchise to go without becoming standard and stale. We've seen that happen with Marvel in these past few years. In my opinion, the last couple Mission Impossible film have felt that way.There are also other staples of this franchise present that have annoyed me for years. The film, like all the rest, is longer than is needed, with too many subplots. The fact that everything is interconnected. Each antagonist is either directly related to Toretto or directly related to a past villain. Each time a past major antagonist becomes either a good guy or an anti-hero. Last but not least, people can't stay dead. Death means about as much in this franchise as it does in Dragon Ball. A character can supposedly die in one movie, but they return for nonsense reasons a couple film later. We see that yet again in this one. Despite the cliffhanger at the end, I have literally no fear for anyone's life in this. No one ever dies.The best thing about this film for me, other than the action, is Jason Momoa as the villain. I will say, he's probably the best villain in the history of this franchise, which is mostly due to Momoa's natural charisma, much like The Rock has. I still miss The Rock, but Momoa's presence evens things out for me.Overall, there is quite a bit to take issue with. But I still found the film fun. The film looks great, with amazing action, like all the past several Fast films. And I'm a bit excited for how this seemingly final story arc ends. If you're a fan of the franchise I think this is a must watch.","

"vanwel-98077","19 May 2023","I've always been a fan of this franchise, what it lacks in writing, it makes up for with great action set pieces. That being said, I didn't particularly like this entry. The action sequences pale in comparison to some of the previous entries. The fact that it starts off with the fast five vault scene makes it even worse. Coming on the heels of a great action film like john wick I couldn't help but feel bored and underwhelmed by this. Most of the jokes don't land with only a couple of bits with Tyrese being funny. The movie also has no conclusion and just sort of ends on a horrible cliffhanger. I know it's a two-parter but the first film still needs to have an ending, something that a movie like Infinity War handled exceptionally. If there's one thing I had to say I liked was Jason Momoa's performance, you can tell he really had fun playing the role and he delivers an enjoyable performance. Overall it's just a bad movie, even for a popcorn flick.","

"RebelPanda","23 July 2023","Fast X, the not-so-anticipated tenth installment in the iconic Fast and Furious franchise, endeavors to uphold the thrill and excitement that defined its earlier predecessors. Nevertheless, despite its fervent attempts to rekindle the magic of past glory, the film ultimately succumbs to the wearisome aspects of a long-standing franchise.Once known for reveling in its own absurdity, the previous movies fearlessly drenched audiences in jaw-dropping action and gravity-defying stunts that relentlessly challenged the boundaries of cinematic adrenaline. These audacious feats, which were enough to make hearts race beyond the speed limit, have now transformed into familiar spectacles that no longer evoke the same awe and astonishment. Even the once-mind-bending spectacle of Vin Diesel executing a gravity-defying 90-degree angle drive has lost its luster, having been viewed ad nauseam throughout the nine preceding installments.The allure of the franchise's former bravado, which once shimmered with an air of audacity, is now overshadowed by a sense of formulaic predictability that hangs heavy in the air. Fast X's narrative finds itself trapped within the confines of its own legacy, reluctantly recycling well-worn tropes and clichés in a bid to replicate the past glories that have etched the franchise into the annals of cinema history. This reliance on established elements stifles the potential for genuine innovation and leaves the audience longing for a breath of fresh air.Even the commendable attempt to inject novelty into the film through celebrity cameos unveiled via a submarine reveal falls short of resuscitating the once-pulsating nerve of the series. The grandeur and extravagance of these surprise appearances momentarily raise eyebrows, but they do little to quell the creeping sense of déjà vu that hovers over the viewing experience.For devoted fans who have embarked on the tumultuous 22-year journey, Fast X might still offer moments of gratification and nostalgia, serving as a testament to their unwavering loyalty to the beloved franchise. However, for those in search of a rejuvenated and imaginative cinematic encounter, the film's adherence to timeworn conventions and a regrettably formulaic approach may leave them yearning for a fresher, more invigorating direction. As the tenth installment in the series, Fast X stands as an illustration of the inevitability that even the most cherished of franchises can endure the passage of time, prompting reflection on the fleeting nature of cinematic enchantment.","

"ozzybux","28 May 2023","The first movie was grounded and excellent and was Point Break on wheels instead of surf boards. How on earth did this transform into the unrealistic, Bollywood style, everyone is James Bond rubbish that it has been since FF4? The last iteration was just too ridiculous and this one goes a bit further.Just like Bollywood movies, the films have become accustomed to detaching from reality, physics, and human capability. I really can't stand these movies anymore, and would be thankful if I never see another one infect the world in the future.I understand that movies are there for entertainment, but bloody hell, at least keep them realistic if they are based in the normal world. Otherwise just add Sci-fi to the genre category.I challenge you to watch the first movie, then watch the last few and see if it all makes any sense to you. But then again, nothing makes sense anymore in this world, everyone seems to be living in some fantasy or another and expecting the rest of us to accept it as reality.","

They are so over the top that they immediately grow tiresome and cease to be fun. The entire thing is shoddily glued together with inane dialog that pays lip service to ""family"" and scenes intended to maximally trigger whatever fond memories the viewers may have of former entries in the series.About the only pleasant aspect is the colour grading, which is pleasantly oversaturated and bright all across the spectrum instead of going for the blue/orange or some other scheme meant as a simple fix for missing visual style.","

"PeetaFr0d0","16 July 2023","I'm not a fan of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, actually I haven't seen any other previous film of that franchise before, so you might expect my opinion on this flick: a generic actioner that only serves as a pick for an enjoyable movie night. I won't call it exactly as a total waste of money and time, I just believe that you won't lose anything if you don't see it. It has some strengths, like the love for every family member and the willingness for self-sacrifice, if necessary, the performance of Helen Mirren as the beloved grandma of the family, and the happy memories from the past of Toretto family. But, aside from these, it has nothing really special and there are far better action movies out there, if you want to see one, without all of those car crashes, that -to me- become boring and gratuitous after some time. It's not downright disappointing, but I'd say it's only recommended to the fans of the franchise and it doesn't truly have something important to offer, apart from lightweight entertainment.","

"paul_haakonsen","9 June 2023","I have to admit that I was in no particular rush to get to watch this tenth installment in the ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise, as each movie, since the original first movie, have been progressively more and more over the top in a ridiculous manner. And I can't claim that I am a fan of Vin Diesel either. So I only sat down to watch ""Fast X"" when I was presented with the opportunity to do so.And just as I had expected, the storyline in ""Fast X"" was every bit as laughable and over the top as I had expected. The entire story was just whack, and I have to admit that I was laughing several times throughout the course of the 141 minutes that the movie ran for. And knowing that there will be a """"Fast X Part II"" is just sort of soul crushing.It got really monotonous and repetitive to listen to Roman (played by Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (played by Chris Bridges) bickering and sizing up one another, all the while the audience just sits there and thinks 'kiss each other already and get it over with'.And you are by no means in for an evening of Shakespearian theater here, when you sit down to watch ""Fast X"". And watching Vin Diesel mumble his way about repetitive dialogue about family and watching him pucker up and looking constipated in every single scene just also wears thin very quickly.Something that does impress me about ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise is the cast ensemble. Because they have an abundance of established actors and actresses on the cast list. And with the likes of Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron, Nathalie Emmanuel, Sung Kang, Helen Mirren, Scott Eastwood and Jason Momoa in this movie, that definitely helps to lift up an otherwise ridiculous storyline.""Fast X"" singlehandedly belonged to Jason Momoa given his fantastic performance as Dante Reyes.Is it fun to watch Dominic Toretto singlehandedly take on the world and escape unscathed doing so time after time? No, not really. And it is just amazing how the laws of physics don't apply to Dominic Toretto and whatever vehicle he is steering. Sure, it looks good on the screen, but realism is fully and wholly out the window in these movies, and ""Fast X"" is no different.And just what kind of father is Dominic Toretto? I mean, sling-shooting a downed and wrecked helicopter engulfed in flame into a vehicle that transports his son and thus exposing his son to mortal danger. Pretty bad parenting right there. And the fact that everything Dominic Toretto does just magically works out without a hitch is just downright annoying and ridiculous. Or when he also endangered his son and jumped the car over the side of a dam, and somehow bypassing the laws of physics once more, as he effortlessly landed on the sloping side of the dam and used it as a ramp. Yeah, so much for realism, laws of physics and proper parenting.Sure, the visual effects in the movie look great, and no doubt about it that it is the reason for why the franchise stays afloat, because it most certainly isn't because of the amazing script writing. And I will say that the visual effects in ""Fast X"" definitely were great, and they almost were the sole thing carrying the movie, was it not for Jason Momoa and Michelle Rodriguez.I had to go back and check it twice, but the scene where Dante (played by Jason Momoa) is racing after Jakob (played by John Cena) in the tunnel, they blatantly ripped off ""Star Wars"", as the iconic sound of a TIE fighter is being used.There was a time when ""The Fast and the Furious"" was about cars and racing, but those days are long gone. Lo and behold, come ""Fast X Part II"" the characters that were presumed killed off in this movie miraculous return in part II, unscathed and fit for more stunts with no regards for the laws of physics.My rating of ""Fast X"" lands on a six out of ten stars, as it was mindless entertaining that looked good on the screen, plus the fact that there were some pretty good names on the cast list.","

The Fast and Furious franchise abandoned all reason, with the sixth installment culminating with its journey into space with F9. But Fast X strips all efforts to ground the characters, dialogue, or action making this film a mess of CGI and lunacy. I found myself laughing as cheese dripped from every line of dialogue. The films have become a parody of themselves, but at the same time, they're still fun. It's hard not to respect two decades and 11 movies worth of story and world-building. While Fast X was insane, it was fun having characters across the franchise parade across the screen. All the cameos and callbacks to early entries prop this movie up and keep it from an even lower score. The only reason to watch this movie is if you are a fan of the franchise. Otherwise, just pass.","

"OPPATRIA_","21 May 2023","Help! This series unfortunately has no end! Vin Diesel as Dom Toretto must once again defend the family, he is supported by many colleagues who also can not act. ""Fast & Furious 10"" (""Fast X"") is a makeshift continuation of the fifth part: Dante (Jason Momoa) is the son of drug lord Hernan Reyes, who was once treated badly by the Torettos. Dante now wants to avenge his father, who was humiliated in the fifth part of the franchise. He also fights for the family - but for his own. As gruesomely crude and poorly told as the film is, if you look at it as a symptom, you can easily derive a social diagnosis from it: In this film, we encounter people without a world, and in the cinema audiences sit without a film. For dismemberment and fragmentation determine the form and content of this series.The main characters, led by Dom Toretto, are anchored in a world dominated by consumerism and individualism. They act as a private intervention force in a gray area between nation-states, reflecting society's increasing disorientation and fragmentation.The portrayal of the family as the highest good is a central element of the film. The Torettos act in the interest of family, and this is used as a cover to mask their own selfishness and individualism. This reflects late modern socialization, in which more and more people live in a present in which they do not recognize themselves.The film shows a return to barbarism on all levels. The characters are people without a world and the viewers are spectators without a film. This is an expression of the total disorientation and fragmentation of society.Despite its action-packed sequences and spectacular stunts, ""Fast & Furious 10"" is an expression of a crisis of the individual and a crisis of the political. The Torettos are a private intervention force operating in the gray area between nation-states.The film reveals a crisis of critique. Dom articulates a malaise, but is unable to connect this diagnosis to an analysis. He is unable to think in contexts.The film reveals nepotism and clear structures that continue to prevail. The Torettos act in the interest of the family against the family interests of another.The film is an expression of an obscure neo-feudalism in which the attention given to someone is legitimized by birthright.","

"neil-476","26 May 2023","When Roman leads a team to Rome for a mission, it turns out to be the opening salvo in a war where a previous caper (the bank vault heist in Rio) made an enemy of Dante Reyes, who is determined to exact vengeance on Dom by destroying his family and associates.I enjoy the F&F films, but I find them shallow enough that I haven't committed them to memory. Thus, I recognise that this 10th instalment in the franchise has plenty of callbacks to earlier instalments (in terms of both story and previous characters popping up), but don't ask me for specifics.Otherwise, this is largely as one would expect - a couple of preposterous and hugely entertaining set pieces involving fast cars and a wilful disregard for the laws of physics, a strong emphasis on the importance of family - oh, and some plot. In fact, the plot is more complicated than usual, with there being 4 ""family"" groups, one baddie with an infinite number of minions and vehicles at his command, one group of maybes, and an assortment of individuals milling about in the middle. Good luck keeping track!Jason Momoa's performance is hilariously deranged. I have seldom seen an actor have so much fun on screen.The set pieces, as mentioned, are ludicrous, but the visual effects for them are truly remarkable.I have seen speculation that this may be the last F&F movie -- my guess is that there will be another. Stick around for the mid-credirs scene!","

"rosscohen-08568","27 May 2023","While I liked the part Jason Momoa played in this film the whole thing just wreaked. I'm not a real fan of the franchise so I just tried to watch this as an objective moviegoer. All the car chases and action scenes ignore the laws of physics to the point of absolute absurdity. This was more like a clip of Grand Theft Auto than a film, and I wonder who keeps green lighting these. With all the stars this movie had and the cost of all the vehicles and special FX there's no way this turns a profit.The story is as old as the franchise itself, go get the bad guy that's trying to blow up the world and prove to the agency you're innocent. There's plenty of things that can be done with a story like this to make it watchable, they didn't do it here. The part with the kayak turning into a plane? What is this, transformers? It almost had a Michael Bay feel to it. Hats off to all the cameos like Jason Statham and Pete Davidson, next time choose better paths for your careers.If you're a fan of the F&F franchise you'll want to skip this one anyways, but you won't. How many sequels until you say 'enough'? If you're not a fan of the franchise you'll definitely want to skip it. But if you're reading this review you probably watched it and want to see if everybody agreed with you. Side note: my dog had puppies a few days ago and I gave her milk which was a a bad idea. She's been sharting all day long and I cleaned the same spot on the rug like 6 times. So I may have been distracted but I still feel like I didn't miss anything in this one. Why was Momoa wearing nail polish? I guess they wanted him to seem like a real nut case which he did. He was the only good thing in this movie, he was kind of funny.","

Jordanna Brewster pops in for less than 10 minutes to remind us she's still a part of the franchise. What exactly is Torento's car made of? Everlasting Gobstopper metal? Lol.","

"ajschmuhl","10 August 2023","The story line was good but Joseph Mamoa ruined the whole movie with the stupid antics, should have been played by a different actor. Everyone else was good in their roles, The length of the movie was just about the right length. I wish I didn't have to give it one star because I've seen the whole series and they are all great and for this movie to be ruined by one actor is just sad. The ninth one was good story and content except for the going to space, I think that was a bad direction to take the movie to but I still loved it. I hope they straighten up that actor so he doesn't ruin the next one also.","

"wolverinexfitxmma","21 May 2023","ACTION PACKED from beginning to end .... I had low expectations of this movie, knowing their was going to be a second part to this movie told me everything I needed to know. Jason Mamoa was the perfect Villain in this franchise. He topped every villain in the series. Their was allot of stories being done here. Diesel's conflict vs Mamoa, Letty in jail , the 4 in Europe, Cena and his nephew, and the agency. It was difficult to keep up and keep track. Allot of scenes felt unnecessary. It was a all star cast and great actors assembled excluding Cena and a tyrese. And it helped build up to what's gonna happen in the second part.Cena was very annoying, he is a horrible actor when his character blew up, I was cheering it on. Tyrese was also annoying, Ludacris had moments of annoyance but like I've said before and stand by my personal opinion entertainers shouldn't be in film.In short the final review: Mamoa villain portrayal led the film to an 8 his feminine side wasn't really necessary but it added humor to the character and when they explained his past of being nuts it explained him in detail , then Tyrese being annoying brought it down to a low 6, then Cena coming in the scene lowered it to a low 4. And Cena being blown up brought it back up to a high 7 and was the highlight of the movie. Tyrese was annoying the movie and flow. Brought it down to a 6.Don't have expectations when seeing this picture let it happen.","

"Neptune165","13 June 2023","It's hard to describe how bad this movie is. The acting, dialogue, plot and so on are at such a low level that this is some kind of record. This will go down in the history of the film industry as an example of the degradation of cinema. It is better to watch at increased speed and in the background, so as not to spend a lot of time on it. It's sad that society is so willing to consume such rubbish. How did a movie about simple street racing, criminal vs cop get to this point? And how did wonder woman come back into it she died fast and furious 6, no one could survive what happened to her. Oh yeah, she is Wonderwoman that figures. This franchise died after tokyo drift, the rest is just too unrealistic. The part at the end where dom and his kid are driving down the dam being chased by flaming fuel to then use nos to escape is just stupid. And I bet you that roman, Tej and the British woman didn't die somehow. Horrible CGI.","

"arsalanweb","17 June 2023","As a longtime fan of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, it pains me to say that ""Fast X"" falls short of its predecessors. This installment, which was highly anticipated, fails to recapture the magic that made the earlier films so exhilarating. Instead, it feels like a tired rehash of familiar elements, lacking the heart and excitement that made the series iconic.The first issue with ""Fast X"" lies in its convoluted plot. While the franchise has always pushed the boundaries of believability, this film takes it to an absurd level. The storyline feels disjointed and overly complicated, trying to incorporate too many unnecessary twists and turns that ultimately detract from the overall experience. The attempt to introduce new characters and subplots feels forced and fails to generate the same level of investment as the core group we've grown to love.The action sequences, which were once a highlight of the franchise, have lost their luster in ""Fast X."" Gone are the days of exhilarating, practical stunts and thrilling car races. Instead, the film relies heavily on CGI-heavy sequences that lack the visceral impact and authenticity of the earlier movies. The overuse of CGI diminishes the excitement and makes the action feel artificial and disconnected from reality.Furthermore, the once-strong ensemble cast seems to be going through the motions in ""Fast X."" While the chemistry between the actors has always been a key element of the series, this time it feels forced and lacking in genuine camaraderie. Even the typically charismatic Vin Diesel fails to deliver a memorable performance, coming across as wooden and uninspired.Another disappointing aspect of ""Fast X"" is its lack of character development. The film introduces new faces without giving them proper time to shine, leaving them feeling underdeveloped and uninteresting. The audience's emotional investment in the characters, which was a driving force in previous films, is sorely lacking, making it difficult to care about their fates or connect with their journeys.Lastly, the excessive focus on flashy cars and expensive gadgets overshadows the heart and spirit that made the early ""Fast and Furious"" films so special. The franchise has always celebrated family, loyalty, and the thrill of the ride, but ""Fast X"" forgets those core values in favor of superficial spectacle.In conclusion, ""Fast X"" is a disappointment for fans of the franchise. It fails to recapture the essence of what made the series great, relying on convoluted plotting, lackluster action sequences, and underdeveloped characters. While die-hard fans may find some enjoyment in the familiar faces and adrenaline-fueled moments, it ultimately falls short of the high expectations set by its predecessors. Here's hoping the next installment can get the franchise back on track and reignite the fiery spirit of the original ""Fast and Furious"" films.","

"movies_are_life_","19 May 2023","Fast X had a job to deliver an action movie that has great action that is riddled with impossible situations. This is a part of the allure of the franchise that has been the driving force that has led to 11 films with more on the way. It is not without its flaws, major ones at that, but they're the type of issues that get somewhat of a pass due to the type of movie they're in. In fact, the flaws help make the movie fun.Dispensing with the bad, don't expect the plot to make a lot of sense. It's basic, but convoluted to the point where you just go along for the ride. There's 3-4 too many characters and at least 10-20 minutes worth of run time that can be cut out. But the time we spend with these characters and the added run time do not equal a movie that drags or ever gets too boring. What works is the comedy, action, and a memorable villain (that perfectly balanced being goofy but also fearful). It's not a comedy, but some of the characters and the situations they're in allow natural comedy to happen. What's not natural is the laws of gravity and technology. The action scenes that happen can only play out in a movie like this, so when a bomb makes its way through Rome barreling it's way through 10,000 obstacles, we appreciate its ridiculousness that not many movies can provide.If this were a script for most action movies, it would result in a much lower rating. Fast X has a script that could purposely be bad to make the ridiculous action pull can be more easily swallowed. Quite simply, the only way you won't like this movie is if you don't like this franchise. It's better than some of the Fast movies, not as good as others, but is for sure a fun time with some standout action scenes.","

"Movies4lyfexx","2 July 2023","Have you noticed the recent (F9-X) quality drop in this series? I bet you have. What's going on? We'd like to know, now wouldn't we.These movies are supposed be entertaining and fun, but the fast series has been about actual people and real cars. Not this weird super hero vibe invulnerable main characters and out of this world technologies.Realism isn't necessary everywhere but this movie has none.Lots of spoilers here so I hope you've either seen the movie or not planning to see it.The good:I watched this for free. I also thought Momoa was funny at times. I giggled when he said ""oh dommyyy"".The bad:Plot - Revenge! It doesn't matter what happens to anyone else or their families as long as Dom gets his way. Bad guy plays with Dom for the whole movie and everyone's still alive.Cgi - Bad, insultingly bad. You can see the fake flames and cars made with poor cgi skills. Anyone can tell where the budget went (not there).Action - Some cool shots but overall just way too ridiculous. The cringe one liners don't help. Cipher fighting several trained men, even though she's supposed to be (?) a tech expert and not a martial arts master. Driving down the exploding dam near the end was just.. bizarre.Why is captain marvel in this movie? She does absolutely nothing interesting and isn't believable in the least. Or maybe the idea is to end this series with a twist that the whole FF cast is clashing with the marvel super heroes for real.How is Gisele alive? I guess we find out in some ridiculous flashback in the next installment. She dropped on a sofa a homeless person had dragged near the airport? Then she just vanished leaving everyone mourn her. How does she operate a submarine? Where did she get it? Who cares.In a flashback we finally see the guy who actually killed the bad guy's father. The person who actually deserves this revenge. Where was he the whole time Dom was wrecking the city and fighting the baddies? Making sitcoms with Kevin Hart?","

"yeswestan","25 August 2023","I'm gonna tear into this so let's go over some of the positives. Jason Momoa did pretty well in this movie, I felt like his character was unexpectedly delightful in his evil and he was pretty funny. There were a few cool moments in the many action scenes. Jakob and Brian were pretty funny. The titles and graphics were cool. The weird CGI shot that ended the film was cool; at least it was something different. The main women had action scenes that were surprisingly not sexualized (I know, the bar is low, but I expected worse).But let's face it: This movie's writing was awful. The plot holes were unquestionable. This movie was cheesy, predictable, and lacked any creativity at all. The comedy was just bad. This franchise as a whole talks down to viewers and explains every little detail in lazily done exhibitions that spell literally everything out. I liked Momoa, but he basically just played the joker but worse. This movie is so unrealistic but it's based in reality and expects you to believe too many ridiculous stunts; yes, I know it's for fun, and it's not supposed to be believable, but please explain WHY a room full of guards has guns that can be turned off remotely. What are they connected to, the wifi??This movie is a little boy's dream: fast cars, sexy girls, guns, violence and action. But every dream has to end sometime. This movie was long, convoluted, unfunny, and overwhelmingly corny. The budget must be divided between stunts and big name actors, which you can bet leaves absolutely nothing for a good script.","

Seen it all before, done better. And a few CGI stunts are even pretty cheap looking. That's cringeworthy for such an action franchise.Even more bad: how about the car chases? At least those must be alright? Nah, not terrible, but nothing extraoridinary either. I am being honest here.Not any good then? It'll do as a mindnumbing blockbuster for the kids. But even they might get bored by the middle part of this movie with way too many talking scenes.Too much talk. Too little riveting action. No jokes. It'll draw audiences to the cinema, no matter how bad the reviews, that's the power of marketing.","

"BLAlley","12 June 2023","The Fast & Furious franchise became progressively more over the top, transforming street-racing thieves into indestructible, superhuman, globe-trotting super spies. Even so, they remained fun and still retained genuine heart.Fast & Furious 7 was the culmination of that while giving us an incredibly heartfelt goodbye to Paul Walker that should have been the end of the franchise, where all involved could hold their heads high and be proud to have entertained audiences around the world.Nope. They had to keep making movies, except with none of the effort and heart of the first seven. The stories are so dumb and convoluted that boxes of rocks, bags of hammers, and assorted wooden posts all shake their collective heads in dismay.Repeating the word ""family"" and having yet another ""family"" barbecue with ""family"" doesn't imbue a movie with heart no matter how many times you say the word ""family"". If that were true every word of this review would be ""money"".The stunts are even more absurd and poorly rendered, which is made even more obvious by the Mission: Impossible franchise which continues to improve both narratively and with its incredible yet authentic stunt work.To the makers of these movies, please stop.","

Tokyo Drift was a complete disaster for one.However, things looked up after that one with good stories and good cast performance. The story about Letty was by it self awsome. Well. Then something happened. Either the writers just went to sleep or no one cared about the movies anymore. The story took a dip and then no one seemed to care anymore. Add explosions and villians and everything will turn out fantastic. No. That's not how it works.And playing rocket league in rome with a bomb? Sigh..

"Mysterygeneration","11 June 2023","The crazily wild motorized antics of Fast X blast forward without a thought of pressing the brakes. Not many movie franchises last longer than twenty years.This high-octane spectacle seeks, and occasionally succeeds, in obliterating any opposition with its seemingly endless supply of madly comic action and its disarming, absurd, and self-aware doses of usually hilarious camp. It's an occasionally jaw-dropping journey that travels the world in its never-ending hunt for new settings and techniques to up the cinematic ante; in the process, it manages to fall apart and triumph over its core absurdity.Although the fundamentals haven't changed, the scope of everything is unmatched for what started out as a tiny hot rod racing drama 22 years ago. This fast movie features a number of returning cast members as well as some fresh faces. The most noteworthy of the latter is the powerful Jason Momoa, whose irrational attitude as the wicked Dante Reyes makes this by far the funniest installment in the series thus far. This entry gains a much-appreciated new dimension because of the plethora of loud laughter.Most people in the fast-paced world appear to be prospering at first. The few early domestic moments have a family down-homeness to them that helps the audience feel more connected to the people. In this film, it seems that practically everyone who has been in a Fast film and is still alive does so, even if only briefly in certain situations. However, the early jollity is quickly replaced by a natural disaster, a genuine carnival of destruction that Dante launches and destroys everything in its path. It should be observed right away that the effects are mind-blowing; undoubtedly, no one has ever witnessed such immense earthly catastrophe imagined in such realistically portrayed pictures.Ancient sites, contemporary marvels, and global capitals are all destroyed like they were just Cub Scout tents. To use a word that is overused, the attacks are truly magnificent. At least initially, nobody knows how to respond to such aggressiveness, so Dante can get away with it. The culprit believes that nirvana has finally been attained; he positively rejoices in his triumphs and grows more and more destructive, as well as entertaining to watch, as he destroys any old or modern landmarks that happen to catch his eye.The effects are truly - to use an overused term - astonishing from a technical standpoint. The images alone could leave one in awe, but add a rich vein of impudent humor as the destiny of the world's wonders is so blatantly played with, and you have something.","

"Fredolow","17 June 2023","Review (600+ characters):
Fast X is an absolute cringe fest, burdened with a cheese-soaked script, appalling acting, and a director who clearly lacks the qualifications to direct traffic, let alone a feature film. While the first few films in the franchise were watchable, the latest additions are nothing short of a complete joke. It's bewildering that whoever finances this garbage has more money than sense. One can only hope that this insufferable nonsense meets its demise here.It's understandable that C-grade actors like Diesel and his cohorts want to squeeze every drop of profit from the franchise, but it's disheartening to see esteemed actors like Helen Mirren attach their names to this debacle without a hint of shame. It appears that the allure of a hefty paycheck outweighs their artistic integrity.Fast X is a painful reminder of how a once-promising series can devolve into mindless cash-grabbing. The over-the-top action sequences and contrived plot twists further highlight the lack of creativity and depth in the storytelling. The film feels like a hollow shell of its former self, trading substance for cheap thrills and gimmicks.In the end, Fast X is a prime example of a franchise that has lost its way, sacrificing quality for profit. The cringe-worthy script, subpar acting, and inept direction make it difficult to find any redeeming qualities. Let's hope this is the end of this insufferable nonsense, allowing the Fast and Furious franchise to be remembered for its earlier, more enjoyable entries.","

"therealjaysmoke","15 June 2023","Oh my goodness! What in the world did I just watched?! This has got to be up there with the worst movies of the year. Granted it was action packed and any kid will definitely enjoy the adrenaline pumped scenes that we've all come to associate with Fast & Furious. But come on, any adult with a little common sense can easily tell that this movie didn't make any sense and obviously nothing here was remotely possible.I always like to compare movies like this to other movies in the same genre to buttress my point and when you take movies like Mission Impossible or James Bond where you can actually see an effort being made to create believable stunts, with Fast X, it's as if the directors accepted that we know that it's not real so to hell with trying to put in an effort and they just went nuts and created this laughable mess.And not only that, the acting on my goodness, was awful. From every single one of them, Jason Momoa wasn't intimidating one bit, I actually wished the father instead should have come back and played the antagonist. Dude was just so over the place, acting like a homo, a wannabe psychopath whose fear tactics couldn't even scare a 5 year old. As usual Dom was stiff n just unlikeable. I dunno why they brought in so much A-listed actors to play half baked roles that made little to no significant impact on the movie.And to top it all off, after 2hr, they couldn't finish the movie?????? Are you kidding me?! I stared at the screen for a whole minute, mouth ajar, wondering what just happened. To be continued??? Like for real? There were so many unnecessary scenes, I could delete about 30-40 min of unnecessary footages from this movie, and you telling me, there was not enough time to finish this discombobulated story?I know I won't be watching whatever comes next. This must have been written by a 10 year old.","

"TwoTonYoda","27 May 2023","Where to begin on this trash heap of a called film. I have watched every Fast and the Furious film several times. And, for the most part, I have enjoyed them immensely. Fast X is not actually a film, I had to stave off sleep the first 20 minutes of the movie. There is no actual plot to the film and the ending is spectacularly pathetic. I would have been less disappointed if they had turned the film into a telenovela. Though at this point with the constant resurrection of characters, it might as well be. The worst part of the film is that there isn't a single moment that you feel the concept of ""family"" I know all of you fast fans will ignore this review, just like I did, but I guarantee you will regret it. PS Jason Momoa, you have no business ruining good films with your utter lack of skill.","

The action scenes are so laughable that I literally can't stop laughing when I see them. The climax had me bending over from non stop laughter at the Road Runner nonsense. I mean who cheers for this slapstick buffoonery. With the exception of Riddick, Diesel has always been unlikabke and most of the rest of the regular cast are a tough watch. I thought Mamoa might be fun to watch but he's just another dumb acting clown. Littered with incredibly awful rap noise. Seeing Rome destroyed by these Road Runner cartoon buffoons was painful to watch. This series had its peak with V ( not that I through IV weren't as bad as anything ever put on screen ). They've steadily gotten worse since V and have now reached heights of unbelievable dreck. And no I haven't watched a full movie in this series since 8; also not finishing 6. I can't even imagine what low brow person enthusiastically watch these but I wouldn't want to meet them. The actors in these movies should be mortified. And to think there's supposedly two more of these in the absolute worst movie series in the history of cinema.","

"email-714","18 June 2023","Oh, Fast X, the self-declared epitome of cinematic action-movie brilliance! As an ardent admirer of mindless car chases, explosions that serve no purpose, and gravity-defying stunts, this movie theoretically promised to check off all the boxes.Theoretically.But alas, in the realm of reality...The ""plot"" appears to have been conceived by a group of eight-year-old boys, although that would be an insult to their budding creativity. The plot, if one can even call it that, is a grotesque abomination of writing that should have been deleted from the word document after the first few pages by any self-respecting writer.I understand that the Fast & Furious series has veered off into a distant galaxy far, far away from its humble beginnings, transforming into a parody of itself. However, that doesn't excuse the complete loss of self-awareness.Let's delve into the acting, shall we? It is not merely bad; it transcends the boundaries of badness and ventures into the realm of wooden and excruciatingly awful. It's a wonder that accomplished actors were able to deliver such performances. Perhaps the blame lies with the pitiful script, which offers no depth or even an attempt at character development. Who knows? It's just plain terrible.And don't get me started on the stunts and action sequences that seem to have been scripted by a deranged lunatic. The previous film, where a car ventured into space, now appears quaint and normal in comparison to this chaotic disaster. We're talking about gravity-defying cars, levitating children, fire-engulfed 20-foot wide bowling balls-oh, the list goes on, unfortunately.Now, you may wonder why on earth I subjected myself to the entirety of this torture rather than choosing the less-painful option of bathing in acid and performing a naked broken glass dance while belting out ""It's been a long day..."" Well, there is a silver lining to this abomination: Jason Momoa. His character brings some much-needed interest, sarcasm, and humor to this trainwreck. He even blesses us with the profound quote, ""Family... Yeurgh!""Vin Diesel (Dom), on the other hand, resembles that one individual who stumbles into a pub on a Friday night, regaling everyone with his ludicrous tales of self-delusion. No one dares speak up because he may be on the verge of needing professional psychiatric help.To make matters worse, I've heard rumors of not one, but two additional parts to this ""final"" movie(!). Yes, that means there are at least four more excruciating hours of ""ffaaammmillllyyyy!!!!"" ahead of us. May the gods have mercy on our souls.In a futile attempt to assist the writers, I've crafted my own ending. Brace yourself...Dom proceeds to add another 87 bottles of NOS to his miraculously intact car, which somehow survived an explosion and a watery grave. As luck would have it, a troupe of trained dolphins comes to the rescue, gently guiding the slightly-scuffed vehicle back to dry land. Dom, his son, and the entire family then embark on a high-speed journey, shifting gears a mind-boggling 164 times, ultimately surpassing the speed of light and causing the Earth to spin backward on its axis. A few more downshifts lead Dom and his merry men to tear open a space-time rift, propelling their car into an alternate universe where they save Paul Walker from his ill-fated attempt to drift through a tree on November 29, 2013. Thus, they save his life, redeem the plot, revive the franchise, and salvage the tattered remnants of my sanity.In summary, my rating for this cinematic gem is a solid 3.14 out of 10... Hmm, a fittingly irrational number for such a spectacle.","

Honestly, I never intend to watch this Fast X but my friends invited me so I thought why not? But, it is a worst experience, thank God Jason Momoa save the show, his character is so fun to watch. This kind of playful and witty antagonist. The worst thing is the story is still similar, it is the same old story that you have watch since Fast 7. They should stop and make other brand new movie. Stop milking the franchise.","

"simaba","16 June 2023","I'd put this up there with birdemic even. A great bad movie. Hilarious even. So ridiculous that it almost feels like they're mocking the audience, like an experiment to see how stupid and weird this can get before people stop watching it. From the first minute the ridiculousness starts with use of footage from a DEAD actor. Like why? It was so unnecessary and so creepy! And the rest of it is just filled with one cheesy unbelievable scene after the other. Everything is unnecessarily over the top. Till the very last scene where the kid jumps for like 3 meters in the air between two turned cars. Again, very unnecessary. On the bright side I laughed more watching this than one would watching a comedy.","

"gggbkdffn","14 June 2023","The worst fast and furious movie made (yet) till they make the next one. Honestly there should be someone with sense, telling these people not to do this again. How does everyone comes back alive I don't understand. I'm honestly having a hard time refraining from swearing so much, because there is no way this movie makes sense. It's so hard for me because I'm such a fan of this franchise. I have a Paul walker signature on my challenger hellcat ffs. I can assure you they make the next movie and in the end the will show Paul walkers brother as him and want us to pay for fast and furious 13. And since rock and vin can't act together... there will be a separate movie for him. I'm honestly done. I won't even watch it even if they give the tickets for free.","

"rdoyle29","25 May 2023","I've been more or less with this series since the fifth installment. That one was actually a pretty great flick, and 6 and 7 more or less stayed on course. I didn't really like 8, but 9 was so intensely ridiculous that it felt like a bit of a comeback.This is a terrible film. The characters feel like AI generated simulacrums running through a vague sketch of a F&F film. There are big set pieces, but they rarely spring to life and are stuffed with terrible CGI. Many of the scenes with these characters talking to each other among the worst written scenes I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through in the theater.I hate Jason Momoa. I didn't think it was possible to dislike him more than I did before watching this film. It turns out it is.This ends on a series of cliffhangers that are supposed to play out over 2 more films. No way. I'm out.","

"madanmarwah","15 July 2023","The director of a cult franchise like ""The fast and the furious "" while making the 10th chapter has to face the challenge of "" how to make the movie different, fresh and new in respect of the action scenes"" because most of the movie is full action anyway. Difficult to say whether director has succeeded because we have a feeling of ""deja vu"" most of the time. The plot is about the revenge of the son of the druglord whom Vin Diesel had harmed in the past. So we have the same fast cars revving up, racing and screeching about in the city streets at night.Director Louis Leterrier presents the usual scenes including car races, intimidation/ challenges, guys with guns, explosions, shattering glass, shady joints, sharp one liners, rock background music, surprising plot twists etc and all this in international locations like London, Rio, Portugal and Antarctica too. Vin Diesel once again drives off an aeroplane in the air through cargo door at the back, manages to land on an adversary's car shaken up but fine and continues with the action. He has done it in the earlier movies. There is a catfight with hand to hand combat between Michelle Rodriguez and Charlize Theron in Antarctica . To balance all these stunts of the mayhem taking place there are scenes talking of family values and faith. The cinematography is breathtaking as usual with some astonishing shots. Can't have a "" fast"" movie without a car race to give you an edge of the seat experience and so there is one. The cast includes the usual Vin's gang who do almost the same things they have done earlier. A word of praise for actor Jason Momoa who has done the antagonist's role exceedingly well. Watch out for post credit title teaser featuring a top character of "" Fast"" movies.","

"Scar38","19 June 2023","What the heck was that? I mean seriously what the heck was it? It was utterly ridiculous with some horrific acting. Now, first of all I'm a fan of Jason Momoa he's usually really good, but in this he is terrible, it's definitely his worst performance yet. Apparently Vin Diesel has said Jason's over acting ruined the movie, well Vin, I totally agree with you, I cringed every time Jason was on screen, and what's with the clothes he was wearing? It made him look camp, I actually got the feeling he was trying to act crazy, a bit like Heath Ledger as the Joker, but what we got was more like Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther, terrible. And what's with the comedy? It's totally unnecessary, it's why Tyrese's character is so annoying.I was excited to see Jason Statham was back for this movie, but he was in it ten minutes, they completely wasted Nathalie Emanuel, and I saw the Alan Ritchson twist coming a fast and furious mile off.Apparently there is going to be two more sequels before the whole thing ends, if that's true, please Mr Diesel get rid of the comedy.By the way I actually thought Vin Diesel was the best thing about this film, he didn't seem childish, whereas Momoa ruined the whole film..... Sorry!","

"C3Banonymous","7 June 2023","I used to love the fast movies but after 7 its just become to much. The movies are both overacted by certain characters as well as under acted. A few scenes were interesting but overall i was just waiting for the thing to end. As much as they try to make you ""hang"" on your seat, in reality they dont. Its cliche upon cliche. We all get its not real but this takes it really out there. Theres no creativity, no flow, just ridiculous stunts, bad actors, and worse writers. This movie is just a mess waded up upon the success of a few movies. The best fast movie by far with storyline was 5 in my opinion and everything else is just a sad attempt.","

"crowbar-53589","17 June 2023","Quite literally the worst movie I've ever seen. Only giving it a second star cause of Charlize Theron and Helen Mirren. Guess there's a reason it only lasted 2 weeks in theaters before it came out for stream. The only explanation is they're trying to see how bad a movie they can make. Yes, it is that bad. And this is from someone that had ZERO expectations going into it. I know Jason Momoa dresses like an eccentric aunt but this is ridiculous. The whole thing has to be a joke. From start to finish. Then when you think it's over, you find out they leave it open for another. And another. And another. Until the slow release of death comes and takes you and hopefully you can slip to another plane of existence where hopefully Fast and the Furious doesn't exist. Save yourself the time. Go get a root canal or something instead.","

"shubro42","16 June 2023","Fast X, the latest instalment in the popular franchise, fails to deliver on nearly every front, leaving audiences bewildered and disappointed. With a complete absence of a coherent plot, subpar acting, and a lack of any semblance of logic, this film falls flat and fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessors.One of the most glaring issues with Fast X is its haphazard storyline or lack thereof. From the outset, it becomes apparent that the writers took a backseat, favouring over-the-top action sequences at the expense of a compelling narrative. The plot meanders aimlessly, introducing convoluted twists and turns that do little to engage or captivate the audience. It feels like a mere collection of random events loosely stitched together, resulting in a confusing and unsatisfying viewing experience.Unfortunately, the deficiencies in the movie extend beyond the weak storyline. The performances by the cast are underwhelming, with stilted dialogue and unconvincing delivery. Even the franchise's seasoned actors seem disinterested and phoning in their performances. This lack of authenticity robs the film of any emotional depth or connection with the audience, leaving characters feeling one-dimensional and uninspiring.Moreover, Fast X suffers from a serious lapse in logical coherence. While previous films in the franchise pushed the boundaries of believability, Fast X seems to have abandoned any semblance of rationality altogether. Spectacular and improbable stunts dominate the screen, defying the laws of physics without any explanation or context. This complete disregard for plausibility only serves to alienate viewers further and undermines the film's ability to suspend disbelief.In summary, Fast X is a disastrous addition to the franchise. Its lack of a coherent plot, subpar acting, and nonsensical action sequences make for a frustrating and bewildering cinematic experience. Die-hard fans of the series may find moments of enjoyment amidst the chaos, but for most viewers, this film is a regrettable misstep. It fails to capture the essence of what made the franchise successful, leaving audiences longing for the days of well-crafted storytelling and engaging characters.","

"whatgift","5 June 2023","Nothing new of note in this instalment - the additional of several new characters (which are reaching MCU-levels at this point) that don't have much of an impact on the plot, and a laughable villain performance by Jason Momoa - not sure what they were going for, but his ""psychopathic"" performance (possibly trying the channel the Joker) fails on almost every level.The action is still pretty good though, and stays mostly grounded until the ridiculous dam sequence at the end that reaches new lows of believability and poor CGI.It drags out the running time like there's actual plot to fill, and the Roman character still proves to be the most pointless and irrelevant to the series (you have to actually be funny to be the comic relief).Still worth a watch for the action, especially with the cliffhanger that leads us into the 11th (and hopefully final) instalment.","

Even if it is, the people must die from the fall due to the pressure but neither happened so this is bull-sh-it. So not make another movie like this we dont want to see you anymore.","

The action scenes are overrated
Spending a lot of money in movies not getting good outputs to satisfy the audience time and money waste and making sequence by year's
At first action sequence they are playing with a bomb rolling down in a city of Rome to the Vatican they think they are playing foot ball (rolling bomb) with cars how wonderful no logic and no physics simply write script and make movies only in dreams we can't imagine how this thing are happening.Some parts CGI works totally sucks
Dom's all genius family always escape from bullets and blasts overcome every hard situation simply.Whenever they think they can get cars ,gadgets, bombs, guns, tanks, planes, helicopters, submarines, anything in the world they can buy as much power as possible.I hope after the next movie they stop making this kind of idiot sequences to deliver to the audience.Audiences are watching and without giving proper feedback to the movies they make like this way whatever they like
Only feedback and bad comments will improve their making
We must review the movie or avoid it then only the worst movies are not made The director and writer search for new good content and search to satisfy the audience. Otherwise they sell crap but they promote like new.","

"QuintenQunt","14 June 2023","Over the last few months, in anticipation of Fast X's release, I took a Fast and Furious nostalgia trip. The last clear memories I had were up to Hobbs and Shaw, with the rest melting into a sizzling pot of Vin Diesel's grunts, nitrous gas hisses, and endless backyard barbecues. What was once about illegal racing and swiping DVD players has evolved into a self-parody of ceaseless adrenaline and ""family values"".And here we are with Fast X, another round of Fast and Furious bingo where 'family' is a buzzword, cars routinely defy physics, and nitrous saves the day. Yet again. In all probability, this movie will fade from my memory before its successor crashes into theatres. Billed as the start of the final act of the 'Toretto Saga,' my enthusiasm is running as low as a beat-up Honda's gas tank. I'm basically rubbernecking this franchise, curious about how far they'll stretch the plot and their penchant for shoehorning in various action stars. I would not be surprised to see Keanu Reeves as Dominic's father's cousin's sister's former roommate who wronged the family in their high school years in future instalments.It's perplexing whether the creators design these sequels with a wink and a nudge, or if they're earnestly trying to deliver genuine tales of high-octane family values.Fast X brings us Jason Momoa as the vengeful son of a past antagonist, who's as gleefully destructive as a toddler in a Lego store. He's out to topple the Toretto empire, wrecking cities and scenery along the way. The series' rogue's gallery, including Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, John Cena, and now Momoa, typically outshine Diesel and his crew, often to the point of switching sides.In the Fast and Furious Olympics of outrageousness, Fast X snags the gold for being the most preposterous. It offers nothing new, stretches credibility like a well-worn elastic band, and crafts a world that feels like a Saturday Night Live sketch of its former self. The stunts and action scenes, once awe-inspiring, now elicit more eye rolls than applause.If you're a diehard fan teetering on the edge of fatigue, Fast X may well push you over. Here's hoping they put the brakes on this storyline before it veers into a trilogy.","

"Bad_Penguin","2 July 2023","FAMILY!!!!!That is essentially the plot of the entire franchise, however family, while omnipresent in the dialogue and the overarching theme, is very much not present in this chapter. Yes we see Dom's son and Mia and Jacob and their mum, and Shaw and Shaw's mum, and Dante and Dante's dad (retconnnnnn), and Elena's sister (remember Elena who Dom had a son with but that is never ever mentioned afterwards and I guess isn't really part of the family?)... Next thing you know Giselle and Han will reveal they did have a child together but they hid it from the gang but now the child is in danger and the child is part of the family so the cars need to go vrum vrum and the guns need to go bang bang to go rescue the endangered progeny.All of that to say that in this 10th installment, the family is somewhat not very present. It's a bit like nobody knew what to do with the ever-growing number of family members because of course Dom can sort it all out himself (because HERO) and so they're all just scattered around the globe doing absolutely sweet-nothing while Dom and Dante pulverize every continent they step on (Bombs go Boom Boom ).Jason Momoa is the best thing about this film by not an inch but a quarter of a mile. His flamboyant take on Dante's character is sure to steal every scene he's in while Vin Diesel is over there trying to act like he's in Hamlet or smth.John Cena was actually pretty decent too. A breath of fresh air in this over the top franchise that takes itself a bit too seriously while defying all the laws of physics. Annoyingly he doesn't make it or does he? If Giselle's cameo tells us anything is that nobody ever properly dies in the Fast universe. So I'm expecting a Jacob's resurrection in Fast XII; return of the Jacob.","

That a movie can be this bad with such a great budget is just... Ridiculous and lazy. It isn't even fun.Momoa was absolutely horrendous in this film. However, sadly, he was probably the best part of this film. He at least made me chuckle a few times.I fell asleep near the end of the movie only to wake up and realize they brought back Gal Gadot's character from the dead. Yeah... This is getting to MCU levels of low stakes...Also, the whole 'family' aspect of this series is even more of a joke now than it was in the earlier ones. Dom is an asshole who constantly gets his 'family' killed (but not really because they all turn back up eventually) so he can make money that he absolutely doesn't need.","

"audavo","16 September 2023","As awful as the writing is, I did manage to learn a few things. For instance I didn't know that all roads in Rome lead to the Vatican and are sloped downhill at such an extreme angle that a rolling ball bomb will roll continuously and never lose momentum no matter what. I also learned that a 1970 Dodge Charger has more traction with its rear wheels in the air than two helicopters have lift combined. And speaking of Dodge Chargers, all model years are indestructible. Seriously, they don't have airbags because they can't be destroyed. You can drop em out of a plane, hit 'em with a crane, if you bet against them, you must be insane! I heard Boeing is going to use dodge Chargers for their airplane black boxes. And think I also heard that after watching Fast X, the Army is retiring the Abrahams tank and awarding the contract to Dodge. I'd say I'm done with this Fast nonsense but I'll watch the sequels because I've watched every other sorry mess from the start. But I'll wait until they're on cable.","

"thesar-2","26 August 2023","Originally, I thought it was a massive mistake in not naming this simply: FX. But then I saw how laughably bad the FX were in this movie and they did dodge that bullet.WOW. With Fast in its title, it was anything but. This movie broke the one rule you don't wish to with an action movie: it was BORING.Bad script, sure - that goes without saying for this dumb monkey series. Beyond that, it's badly paced, all-over-the-place with a 170-person-cast and while I did appreciate the butch, manly-man villain stepping out of the stereotypical macho man role, I couldn't tell if he was gay or mocking gays. Also, he really sucked as a villain.The Super Spy team must split up to all corners of the globe while Dom is all about Fam again. Meanwhile, Part V's villain's heir is hellbent on revenge.This franchise should've been G. I. Joe instead as it fits the same universe as the Transformers with this scattered, unrealistic and humorless screenplay. I will give them props for having Charlize Theron, Jason Statham and Helen Mirren back again - I'll never complain about seeing them. Plus, Sung ""Han"" Kang is really hot. At least he's something worth looking at.The first 75% I was giving the movie credit for not going too overboard with the moronic stunts...and then the climax hit. Listen. I watch Mission: Impossible for the real, crazy and fun stunts. I watch the Fast & Furious films to laugh at the grade-school kids' ideas for live-action cartoon stunts. Well, I used to.About 2 movies ago these stopped being so-bad-it's-good. And #9 just made me hate life with how STUPID the stunts were. This movie tricked me into thinking there weren't any braindead stunts until the climax.Why don't these characters just simply learn how to fly? I mean they break every other law of physics.Mercifully, I already knew this was part one of two of what I believe is the final two movies. I only watched this one thinking it HAD to be better than 9 and what the hell, I'm a completionist.Quite frankly, I watched 11 of these movies now and I don't think I can take another one. I honestly don't care what happens in the climax. I've seen them all and I barely know who any of these people are. Nor do I care anymore.***Final Thoughts: I've only seen each one once and a ton blended into each other, but from memory, here's the best to worst for the F&F franchise:1.

3. The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift
4. Fast & Furious 6
5. 2 Fast 2 Furious

His performance is akin to a grade 9 high school drama class production. I guess is all you want to see is fast cars, explosions and unbelievably cheesy dialog then this is the movie for you. But unlike most action movies, it requires a special level of 'dumbed-down' mentality to get through the entirety of this movie.

"blueplaza","21 May 2023","Yet another installment in the Fast franchise. First, why this movie gets a 6/10 when it probably shouldn't even exist. Simply put, they deliver what the masses want: 2+ hours of over the top action. This movie delivers nonstop explosions, fight scenes, car chases, all while defying physics. On a base level, this movie will satisfy people's desire for mindless action.Now, for what was wrong with it. I start with the high level plot. Referencing back to possibly the last good movie (Fast Five), Vin Diesel stitches together what feels like an anthology of different plots: escape movie, comedy, buddy road trip, spy movie, with the spotlight squarely on Diesel himself. It's hard enough remixing old movies, as they tried to do here with Fast Five, but to attempt to do so in such an audacious and nonsensical way was... an unfortunate decision. Also, not allowing Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) to die signals they know they've departed far from what initially brought audiences in. At this point, just hoping they don't try to use CGI to bring him back. Would be misguided.Now, into the specifics. The movie begins with the classic family barbecue. They introduce a character I didn't know existed (fine, I'll ignore for the sake of ""family"") but then, for all the talk of ""family,"" we never actually see all the characters in the same scene again for the duration of the movie. That's right, not even a single moment where they all get together in a room to come up with a plan together. Why? Because they likely filmed this movie as several separate mini-movies that they then edited together without even trying to sync the actors' schedules. As for introducing characters, I'm not going to go into all the ridiculous and seriously confusing new characters. There are several articles on this I recommend looking up.Throughout the 2+ hours of senseless action, no scene made me feel anything besides a brief moment as we arrive back to Rio into what harkened back to the early days of the Fast franchise. For a brief moment they gave us cool shots of cool cars with cool music and cool people having a good time. They even give us a hint of a straightforward street race. Simple. It's what fans fell in love with in the early 2000s. But then they reveal high tech bombs under the cars in the race, and worst off, they didn't even finish the race. If you're going to go a different direction, fine, do the space and jumping through buildings thing, but don't pervert the street race.This movie had no substance nor depth. It's movies 6 through 9 on steroids.In sum: watch this movie for free at home when you're in the mood for a couple hours of mindless action while you scroll on your phone or chat with the people sitting through it with you.","

"dironda","18 August 2023","Yes, you read it right. I have chosen to watch the whole franchise in a couple of days. Call me stupid (cuz I do), call me brave, but I did it. And an hour ago I finished this last one and from the heart and whilst having strong emotions I am writing this review.So I had not seen 9 before, and there was reason for that. The series lost their appeal over the years. But now 10 became available to me and I figured I might give it a go, which meant I also needed to watch 9 (because they are all linear in their story). But as I forgot quite a lot of the previous ones, let's just start at the beginning. With the first installment that got me hooked in the first place. Why is that important for a review about number 10? Bear with me.Back in 2001 I was in my mid-twenties when the first F&F came out. While I never said it was one of the best movies I had seen, it did touch something within me. The simplicity of it all, the shiny cars, the excitement of this unknown underground scene, the attitude of Dom... it opened a world I had not experienced in that way, and I fell for its charms. As guys in their mid-twenties tend to do. Me and my best friend watched that over and over again, could quote Dom hardstyle and he even went so far as to start tuning his car, adding these fun lights to it, rock a spoiler that didn't quite fit.The family thing worked, the group of actors worked, the storyline to connect the action worked, tho thin, but grounded and believable. You felt like the characters were in real danger. There was tension, heroism, even somewhat believable (tho cheesy) lovestories. It kinda had it all.Then the filmmakers discovered this scene had a market, and they decided to milk it. Unfortunately they milked in classic Hollywood style, where every new installment had to top the previous one in grandeur, action, explosions, A-listers, etc etc. And while the movies and the budgets got bigger, the distance to their core and heart got larger.As much as the first movie showed a world where you might want to be a part of, the sequels grew further and further away from a world that comes across as even remotely believable. Dead characters started returning, villains became bloodbrothers within an hour, and in all culminated in F9, where we saw the two funny characters (not so much skilled, but there for the lolz) ""drive"" their car into space to ram a satellite and save the world yet again, all the while never being in any danger. What the hell were we watching?Now for the final installment. Fast X. It was fast in the sense that a lot of poor decisions in filmmaking were glued together in a chaotic rampage of scenes. It was not so fast to watch, in the sense that it was a tough one to sit through. The director said he wanted this thing to be more grounded as he figured out that going into spaces may have been a step too far. Also, by the original Hollywood philosophy of always going one step further than the prequel; where does one go with a carmovie after you have circled the earth, ramkilled a murderous satellite and parked on a spacestation? So as much as I appreciate Leterrier understanding there are limits to what you can do, you can't ground this thing anymore. Fast X still was a collage of poor characters, all playing James Bond, in almost non-existent written rollercoaster of nonsensical movement. I wish it wasn't so, but in nothing I saw I felt the integrity that the first episode had. That pure love for cars, or simple storytelling of ""just a nice action movie"". Bigger is not always better, and this finale of the franchise being expanded over three movies? Why? I can write all that matters about the plot on one sheet of toiletpaper.So, why write the review from the perspective of the franchise? Because with bringing back all these old characters and keeping this stuff like family still being so much the focuspoint of these movies, it's clear they aim to provide lipservice to the original fanbase and keep them onboard. You need to watch all of them in line to clearly see where they keep changing it into some bizar parody of the original, and where they cling on to familiar things that really have less and less a place in new ways of approaching F&F. Everything is meant to be a way to please their crowd. But as I painfully discovered; I am not that crowd anymore. I am no longer that 20-something old kid that was aroused by the fast life of streetracing, gorgeous girls, tough men, and fast cars. I am a 40-somethig dude who still liked the first installment best, because it was the best movie. The horror that is Fast X, it isn't for me. Going one step further; after watching all of them again, I found that even while being this 40+ year old geezer, I still got excited about the same things in part 1 I was excited about decades ago. Simple as it was, it appealed.Grounding something is keeping it relatable. I read some positive reviews about this movie where people said you have to take it for what it is. The term ""suspension of disbelief"" is essential here; stuff is happening that makes no sense, but for the purpose of enjoyment we just try to not see that. However, there are limits to what you can do in an action movie with regards to... let's say... natural laws, or what a human body can deal with. I can forgive an action movie for doing that a little. I can't call it a movie anymore if that happens for two hours straight.I also read a lot about Jason Momoa being the only savior of this otherwise bad movie. Granted, for a moment I was stunned and intrigued by the way he played the villain. I had not expected a Batman villain from the animated series to enter this ""grounded"" flick. Overacting can be fun, but it took me all but a few minutes to wonder where he got his superpowers from to be able to all he did. Knowing everything that will happen, where it happens and when? And where did this traumatized, socially ill Brazilian rich kid learn to better at everything than all the specialists in Dom's team? Again, it goes beyond suspension of disbelief what they ask me to accept. In next episode of this grand adventure I expect him to be able to fly like a bird and change water into wine. Nothing less. You can say that's creative writing, but just adding superpowers to a character to make more explosions and plotchanges happen is really just lazy and poor writing.So is Fast X maybe for a new generation? Fun question, sad answer. My daughter is now almost as old as I was when I first watched F&F. This was the first F&F she ever watched, she's seen none of the ones before. And mind you, she likes tough guys, beautiful women, fast cars and exciting action. And she felt this movie is bloody horrible. Nothing made sense to her, and she knows none of these people, or why they do what they do, nor did she manage to get a connection with any of them. However... she did love it when out of nothing came Wonderwoman in a submarine. Wonderwoman. In a submarine. Out of the blue. Because why not. Made no sense, but it was extremely funny to her.While she laughed, I could only cry.","

"viewpointstudio2013","21 May 2023","This so-called movie is an absolute abomination that insults the intelligence of anyone unfortunate enough to watch it. From start to finish, it's a mind-numbing exercise in unreality and absurdity. It's as if the filmmakers decided to throw logic and physics out the window and replace them with mindless CGI stunts and laughable plotlines.The characters in this disaster of a film are nothing more than one-dimensional caricatures with zero depth or development. They spout cheesy one-liners and engage in over-the-top action sequences that defy all laws of physics. It's almost as if they possess superhuman abilities, defying gravity and surviving ridiculous crashes without a scratch.Speaking of crashes, the CGI in this travesty is so blatantly fake that it's impossible to suspend disbelief for even a second. The explosions and car chases are so poorly rendered that they look like they were created by a middle school student experimenting with basic video editing software.As for the plot, if you can even call it that, it's a convoluted mess of contrivances and predictable twists. The writers must have been running on empty when they concocted this nonsensical story. It's riddled with plot holes big enough to drive a tank through and relies heavily on deus ex machina moments to keep the flimsy narrative afloat.To make matters worse, the acting in this disasterpiece is wooden and uninspired. The actors seem to be on autopilot, delivering their lines with a lack of emotion or conviction. It's clear they were only there for the paycheck, and their performances reflect their disinterest in the material.In conclusion, ""Fast and Furious: The Fake and Furious Nightmare"" is an insult to cinema and a waste of time. It's a mindless spectacle that relies on cheap thrills and flashy visuals to distract from its complete lack of substance. Save yourself the agony and skip this abysmal excuse for a movie.","

"aarnetprofile","21 June 2023","Where to start?.
This movie is for those who have IQ score in negatives. Why?.
Gravity doesn't exists anywhere in the movie. For that matter, entire Science principles have been ignored..
Heroes' car will crash 50 times on iron machines, other cars, concrete, tar roads, flip over 20 times, tires burned but still will run at 100 mph..
Their idea of saving Rome is to destroy half the city and kill all those who happened to cross their path. But they did manage to save a lady and her two pet dogs. Bravo..
Cars defied gravity even when driving at 90° angle. Cars even carry iron vault (older version in series) and big iron ball with bomb inside and are capable of pulling down two military helicopters..
None of the good guys are impacted by car crash, automatic machine guns, fire, bombs or even tear gas. They didn't even need a band aid..
Lot of familiar faces in leather jackets who think it's cool to utter cringe dialogues. The rivalry between two coloured character is the worst..
Bunch of ladies have a side track in 'b' grade movie sci fi scenes ending up in submarine in arctic. If they do submarine flips in the next version then not even God can save them..
We all know that with the departure of Paul Walker the good part of the series was over. But this X version is the lowest they could stoop..
Usually we have film age rating as PG-13, U, U/A, A. This is one is MR - mentally r3t*rded.","

The cars can change and explosions and yes, that will please some, but for those with half a brain maybe not.The film has a weak bag guy, a poor plot, our dodgy good guys going up against someone who has just stole a powerful computer system basically which can hack, track etc, so of course the fast crew do nothing to prevent such attacks.No protection on electronics, no hiding their faces. No wigs or disguises. Etc. I honestly struggled to continu watching this as the writing and acting was so bad and is not like your dealing with talented actors to begin with.Like any franchise, you push the same stuff to long, people get bored and writers gets lazy.","

Dom is just a Superman, and never got a single stretch after car crashing?! And not to mention his cloth is always clean?! This just makes the plots unreal. How could you rationalize the killing of those people from agency? Are they all bad people? I almost feel all of this family need to go to jail at this point... it's pathetic that I feel I start to hate the leading actors after watching the movie. You could sell the family love and love between the father and the son, but sorry, I, as an audience, really don't feel this way. Such a bad movie. Hopefully it goes to streaming directly for the next one, not worth the big screen.","

The special effects maybe $1m (they aren't great), Vinny probably got $10m, script writers about $250, so where did the rest go?A few familiar faces pop up for a quick pay day, but this adds nothing to the story. I literally had no idea what was going on after about 15 mins and I'm not an idiot (or maybe I am for paying for this crud). Everyone is starting to look really old and most of them still can't act.I only rented this for my 15 & 12 year old sons and even they thought it was dull and stupid.

Hollywood finds a target audience with an IQ barely that of a mental defective, and milks it until not a drop remains, all the time raking in millions upon millions of dollars, and subjecting audiences with a modicum of intelligence and good taste to this circus of atrocious acting, bad (barely there) dialogue, non-existent storylines and more special effects and ""stunts"" than should be inflicted on any human being with a respectable upbringing.

"aaravsengar","24 June 2023","Fast X, the latest installment in the long-running Fast and Furious franchise, promised to deliver another high-octane, adrenaline-pumping experience. However, despite its potential, the film ultimately fell short of expectations, leaving me disappointed with its overall execution.One of the main issues with Fast X was its lackluster and convoluted plot. The story seemed to have been sacrificed in favor of extravagant action sequences and over-the-top stunts. While the Fast and Furious series has never been known for its complex narratives, Fast X took this to a new extreme. The plot felt disjointed and predictable, with little room for character development or meaningful emotional arcs.Another letdown was the characterization. Fast X introduced a few new faces to the franchise, but they failed to leave a lasting impression. The characters lacked depth and were overshadowed by the grandiose action set pieces. Even the returning cast members seemed to be going through the motions, delivering their lines without much conviction or enthusiasm.Moreover, the pacing of Fast X felt uneven and rushed. The film jumped from one action scene to another without allowing for proper build-up or tension. This resulted in a lack of suspense and made it difficult to become fully invested in the events unfolding on screen. It felt as though the film was trying to cram in as much action as possible without considering the overall flow and coherence of the story.The storylines feel disjointed and poorly executed, lacking the cohesiveness and thrill that made the earlier movies so enjoyable. Rather than presenting a cohesive narrative, Fast X seems to jump between unrelated events, resulting in a fragmented and confusing viewing experience.One of the most disappointing aspects of Fast X is the overwhelming abundance of clichéd and cringeworthy moments. The dialogue feels contrived and forced, and the attempts at humor often fall flat. These cringe-inducing scenes overshadow the few genuinely entertaining action sequences, making the overall viewing experience tedious and frustrating.","

"parksiet","24 May 2023","I genuinely have no business reviewing Fast X. I'm not a big fan of the Fast and Furious movies, and really only saw this one because I was curious to see how truly ridiculous this one would be after F9 took some of its characters to space IN A CAR. Needless to say, I don't think very highly of these movies to begin with.On the positive side... it's a little better than the last few movies, and a little less crazy and ridiculous. However on a more negative note... it's an absolutely horrendous garbage movie; it's a complete mess of a film. But... I don't regret watching it because I had a completely good time while the movie was on screen. I was dying of laughter for most of the film alongside my friends - the movie was hilarious...ly bad. Alas, we were all laughing AT the movie, not with it. It would have been fine if this movie was intended as a comedy... but the fact it asks us to take it seriously when it's essentially an unintentional self-parody of the franchise makes it quite problematic. It's a fast-food movie, and quite forgettable, but I can't say I wasn't entertained while watching it.But you can be entertained while recognizing the movie you are watching is absolutely a piece of crap at the same time. The only reason I gave it this high a rating is because of how good a time it let me have with my friends. I can guarantee if I was to have watched this alone... I would rate it much lower.I know I am part of the problem here, but I really hate that audiences today are so accepting of movies that really don't try. This movie is so ridiculous and stupid that it is entertaining, but it has absolutely no story, no characters, and nothing to care about to back up the mindless action we see on screen. Why do we assume you can only have one or the other? Why do we just accept being given one or the other? We can have a good movie with strong writing while also having great, bombastic action! For example, Mission: Impossible - Fallout, or even Captain America: Civil War gave us riveting narratives, wonderful twists and turns that made sense, multi-dimensional, layered characters with beautiful inter-character conflicts and they did all of that while also giving us big bombastic set-pieces, great action, and great fights. So I don't know why when it comes to this franchise we as film audiences just accept being handed half-assed mediocrity. I expect better. Heck, in the last year we've seen better: John Wick 4, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Top Gun: Maverick, or even Avatar: The Way of Water. I would love to enjoy Fast X as the filmmakers intended me to, but I can't when all they offer is mindless, ridiculous action with no semblance of depth, story, or character. They gave me absolutely no reason to care. If they want me to enjoy it as a comedy, fine - then I'd say this was an effective movie. But the fact that they ask us as the audience to take it all seriously... it makes me truly want to laugh at the movie. Because they didn't do the work to earn my emotion, my attention in that regard. Sure, there were redeeming qualities and I had a good time laughing at it with my friends, but that doesn't let them off the hook for making a terrible movie.I mean, when half your movie is shot without a director, and when you eventually hire one, you only give him 3 days to prepare before shooting... I don't know what else you expect to get besides a mess. This film was probably doomed from the start, and even if Louis Leterrier did try his best to save the film, there is absolutely no way he could have saved it with the circumstances he was put in. Considering those circumstances... maybe this is a decent film. But it shows why movies need a director at the helm - it is very clear that many sequences here were shot without clear direction and vision. They are all over the place, with many different tones and visual languages. It really feels like an instance where there were too many cooks in the kitchen, and that is likely because Leterrier was brought on too late. The film is just all over the place and I can't say it ever felt cohesive. Plus, as part 1 of a larger story, it falls into all the traps that a part 1 could: it's all set up, no resolution, it has really dumb twists leading to an unbelievable cliffhanger that I couldn't take seriously, and most of the plotlines in the movie just felt like filler. It also really tried to copy the Infinity War template, splitting up the crew into groups on different ""missions"" (I say it in quotations because really only Dom had a plot where he had to do things, the rest of the characters were just running). The story as a whole is nonsensical and is riddled with plot holes and misleading moments that don't make sense when the twists are revealed. It also has some pretty horrible dialogue... like Star Wars prequel levels of awkwardness. Even the humour didn't land. At least the action was exciting again, even if it was still quite silly and ridiculous. (The crane scene in Rome had me howling... you'll know it when you see it).BUT... Jason Momoa was goddamn fantastic in this movie! He was the highlight for me, and would be one of the only reasons I'd ever rewatch this one! Momoa knows what kind of movie he's in from the start (seems to be the only cast member who knows), and he just has fun with the role! I loved how he played it, not taking it overly seriously and delivering one of the best and most memorable villains in the franchise because of this. I loved his energy and how bonkers of a performance he gave - despite giving a very silly performance, he commanded the screen with it! If only more of the cast could have fun with it like Momoa did!I'm finishing writing this review a day after I saw Fast X... and I gotta say... I can barely remember what happened. It's a very forgettable movie that left no lasting impression on me. For a movie that cost $340 million to make (where'd that money go??), you'd think it would have offered up something so incredible, so memorable. Instead... it's just 2 and a half hours of mediocrity that is really only fun if you're with a group of friends. Sure, it might be the best since Furious 7, but that's not a very high bar to beat. The movie is pretty bad.Maybe Part 2 can be better... but at this rate, I don't have high hopes.And yet, I know I'll be there with a group of friends laughing at the ridiculousness on screen, just like with this one.It's really the only way to get through these movies.","

We even learned that ""you don't need an oxygen when you have a family"", but now it will also remind you really old movies where car chase was shot in low speed but has been played twice as fast in the movie in order to look like high speed chase...Personally, I can say two good things about this movie:
1. It is a sequel and therefore all your favorite cast is back and they even remind you characters you liked in previous movies.2. I liked Jason Momoa's distinctive character he is playing.","

"spencermcook","22 May 2023","Part one of two films (or three apparently) to wrap up the Fast and Furious franchise, but then again I'm not sure we can trust that either. These stories continue to move away from the foundation of practical racing paired with building relationships, and move more and more toward explosive action comedies ultimately watering down the development of the characters we used to care about. Each scene transitions quickly making the production feel rushed and scattered out of place. Jason Momoa is eclectic in this over-the-top role as the main villain, however he adds a refreshing flavor to an established group of recurring characters. The film relies on its previous success stories and less on future possibilities, keeping the ambition of storytelling contained and absent from this project. It's Fast and Furious and you get exactly what you expect.","

The movie has become monotonous and fails to offer anything fresh. Furthermore, the actors appear weary and have lost their passion, which further dampens the overall experience.

The only thing I can say good about this movie is that Jason Momoa carried, and that he is a great villain. Momoa is an incredible actor and his character is actually interesting and one of the more memorable villains in the franchise. And John cena AAing someone through the house was quite funny. Having said that the plot was just boring. The fast franchise really needs to focus on going back to its roots when the story was about street racing and actually about cars. Not whatever it is now. I was extremely disappointed and was expecting it to be a lot better.","

This something (u cant call it a movie) its an insult for any decent person with a brain. Stop it!I remember the first FF... it was sooo nice! Still a popcorn movie but nice! It was something new and people loved it...
I dont understand why would you do a movie like this in 2023!?!?!And Momoa its like a very bad copy of Joker (Joaqin Phoenix) ... keep him Marvel movies, please!!!The story its soooo bad, its sooo unrelistic and even for an 5 yo child its stupid!Stop making stupid movies!!","

"rbrt_gilchrist","27 May 2023","The fast franchise jumped the shark well before this entry. But it won't stop people from coming out to see what Dom and his crew are up to.The biggest problem with this film (and there are many) is that everyone seems to be in a different movie. Even sets seem to be composed into the background from time to time. It wouldn't surprise if there were three different locations filming at the same time in all of the tax havens for films.The car stunts which are a big draw even are obscured by filming them tighter which almost leaves you feeling what is the point. Also, I feel there were more CG cars than normal for a fast film which was a little disheartening.BBBUUUUUUUTTTTTT, Jason Mamoa saves the film single handedly. You haven't seen a villain quite like this before. Everything about his character Dante is cranked up to 11. He is the drawcard of this film and his backstory is woven clunking into the fabric of Fast 5 but at least drives the story forward consistently.Louis Leterrier is a fine directer given the right material and tone. Unfortunately Fast X isn't one of them. It would have been a very different film with Justin Lim at the helm considering his visual action chops.If you like the fast films it's at least better than number 9.","

"arod_85","4 June 2023","Okay...so this should be the last installment but the movie is obviously part one of 2 so none of the 100 storylines are tied up by the end. After that, I hope this is the ""last ride"". The endless explosions, the unrealistic defiance of physics, and bad acting from even the main cast had me checking my watch several times. It was overstuffed, with character after character, new and old from previous installments, however, many were not even vital or relevant to the plot. They even brought back characters that were killed off in previous movies with no reasonable explanation for how they survived (again). A franchise should do this on occasion, but when you continue to do it, it just gets silly and the audience thinks ""why bother?"" The plot was simple and redundant. A previous villian's family member comes back for revenge. Didn't they do this several times already? Oh wait, and a new friend of the ""family"" is secretly working for the bad guys. Hasn't that been done several times in this franchise too? Also without a reasonable explanation. I was a big fan of the franchise probably up until the 5th movie, where the movies just became downright unbelievable and laughable. We were very bored so we went to watch it, but if I were going as a fan, I would definitely skip this because you will be dissatisfied. There was one highlight to the film. Jason Momoa was a delight. He was probably the only bright spot in this mess of a movie. I could have watched him prancing around for two hours and been more entertained.","

"batistamitja","20 July 2023","I had fun watching the movie. But eventually the resurrections are just way too mutch. It certainly feels like the Avengers infinity war of the fast franchise. The performance from Jason Momoa was the best thing about the movie, he gave me Joker vibes(Heath Ledger) and it felt nice. The movie gave me goosebumps somethimes but some cringey oneliners that were said very very often brought me down and sometimes even into laughter. The post credit scene is very nice to see. I knew that the movie is just part one(like the infinity saga) of the finale. After the movie ended I honestly burst into laughter because the deaths in the franchise became meaningless and even the charecters that died in this movie didn't hit because they'll probably return in the end... Conclusion: fun to watch, cringey, meaningless!","

"davidtresmat","13 June 2023","It's crazy how bad it is this thing. And i don't get the reason of why people still paying for this.I'm not asking for a ""good movie"". I'm asking for fun. They keep pushing the dredful """"""""jokes"""""""". There is a pointless scene with marihuana jokes included for MINUTES. No laughs, no nothing. Feeling dead inside and watching the movie at x1.5, sometimes jumping 10 secs or more and STILL FEELS TOOOOO LONG!!! This movie is almost 3 hours. Why. They are justifyng the second part??? Supposedly, when you do movies this long and with a cliffhanger is for build some tension.There is no tension, no thrill, nothing. It feels bald, empty, a cashgrab for paying Diesel's retirment becouse he can't do anything interesting. He can't act. And in action movies, this isn't necessary a bad thing if you know your limitations.Don't pay for this, for real. Don't go to cinemas. Just stop it. I enjoy action movies. This is not enjoyable anymore.","

"kpanditrao","17 June 2023","I see there are hundreds of negative reviews for this film but yall forget one thing. Problem isn't these pathetic Fast n Furious movies; problem is you people still watching it in theaters which led this movie to earn some $700 million at Box Office, and I am pretty sure FnF 11 will be huge at Box Office too.So, what's the point of giving it negative reviews? It's kinda shi!ttt but yall are the ones thats eating this sh!ttt so producers don't give a sh!ttt about logic or quality of the movie. Just do random weird action scenes and people will throw money at this garbage. These FnF movies won't stop unless there's a massive Box Office failure but I doubt that will ever happen because world is stupid just like these movies.","

"askeland89","9 December 2023","Fast X, the latest addition to the legendary Fast and Furious saga, left me utterly speechless. From the heartwarming family reunions to the mind-bending physics-defying stunts, this movie is a true testament to the laws of gravity being optional.Vin Diesel, thespian extraordinaire, delivers a performance that will surely be remembered for generations to come. His emotional range is so vast that you can practically feel the intensity of his facial expressions through the screen. It's like watching a master class in emoting while driving a car at 200 mph. Who knew family values could be so closely intertwined with drag racing and explosions?The plot is a rollercoaster of surprises, twists, and turns that will leave you questioning the very fabric of reality. The intricacy of the storyline is matched only by the subtlety of the dialogue, which is so profound that you might miss it if you blink. The film is a symphony of profound insights and thought-provoking conversations-truly an intellectual feast.Let's not forget the breathtaking cinematography that captures the essence of speed like never before. The camera work is so seamless that it's almost as if the cameraman strapped themselves to the hood of a speeding car just to get that perfect shot. A sacrifice for art, if you will.In conclusion, Fast X is a cinematic marvel that defies conventional storytelling, effortlessly blending family drama with vehicular acrobatics. Vin Diesel and his co-stars have once again raised the bar for what cinema can achieve. I left the theater with a newfound appreciation for the complexities of life, family, and the laws of physics. Truly, a film that will be remembered for generations as a groundbreaking masterpiece in the world of cinema. Or not.","

But the problem is FF should be real in some sense!This is not a super hero movie, the reason people loved FF1 , 2, 3 is because there are real cars with real people. People do get hyped up watching how characters interact with situations but not tanks and planes and beyond!Tokyo drift was a great show because its about people, real people!!!!The new series is ruining the previous reputations... To be brutally honest, how many people grown from the FF1 wants to watch this space ships and submarines non-sense??Clearly Gen Z dont know what this franchise came from too??Can you please at least respect the works done from the begining!","

"Terrorformer","30 September 2023","Like c'mon... if you're watching the tenth Fast and Furious movie, you know by now that these movies are stupid. They don't need to make sense. They are very self aware. I honestly have come to expect them to be more ridiculous every time and welcome it.I have to say I was pretty surprised by this movie. After Paul Walker died I wasn't sure if they would be able to keep me interested. The last 2 movies (8 and 9) were pretty uneventful and I was kinda struggling to care. I think Charlize Theron being the villain had a lot to do with it. Never really cared for her as the antagonist.Here we get Jason Momoa, whom I'm not a fan of at all to be honest.. but I actually enjoyed how cartoony and over the top he was. I think it's what this franchise has needed for a while. Basically Joker...But yea I also liked the cliffhanger ending. Left me with something to kinda sorta look forward to in the next one.Again. I'm not saying this is a good movie be any means. But it's serviceable if you're into these mindless action movies that you watch while stuffing pizza in your face hole.","

"Svenstadt","19 May 2023","I was pleasantly surprised by this. Anyone who has seen the prior movies will know what formula to expect. As the series is about to wrap up, expect many characters to start to get killed off. This really surprised me on many levels. It isn't just more of the same but keeps things interesting. There were several surprises throughout. It wasn't quite as corny or sappy as prior iterations. My all-time favorite was ""The Fate of the Furious."" This was about female empowerment, which was the overarching theme of this one. Dom kinda played a supporting role while letting the chicks in his life do the storytelling.","

"Fizgig777","16 January 2024","I've followed the Fast 'n' Furious franchise from the beginning.... The movies were fun, not overly complicated to follow, mostly mindless escape from reality.... That last on in the franchise that I actually enjoyed watching as Fast 5..... It's been going downhill all along, yes, but each one after Five hits a new low....Then you have something like Fast X..... They drag in footage from previous movies, but they don't really interweave into the story .... So much so that they're virtually pointless with the small exception of using clip from a previous movie to build the background of the new super villain.And that new villain is more of a psychopathic joke told by a comedian who's had a lobotomy. Not a fan of Momoa, nor do I particularly dislike him... What I can say after having seen about 50% of his See series (got bored with it), is that this type of movie is out of his range as an actor. The character wasn't believable in the first place and his acting didn't help things. The attempts at humor just fell flat..... And the scene with the dead guys propped up in lawn chairs, what was the point? What was funny is how utterly ridiculous Momoa looks in pigtails.The CGI work in this one, you'd think would have been better as the tech. To create it has gotten better by leaps and bounds..... Nope..... It's terrible! I mean, like 1990's CGI terrible. Doesn't even come close to appearing like a finished product, much less appearing believable..... In some of the gun fight scenes, bullets can be seen ricocheting off people, for pete's sake -- one off the torso and another off a foot.... Didn't anyone edit the movie? C'mon now..... And it's noticeable first because the CGI is so bad and second because the movie is actually boring..... Way too many scenes of blowing stuff up and shoot outs that drag on and on and on and....Some of the hand-to-hand combat scenes were well done, I'll give them that.The car crashes and wrecks and bombs that just ONE car survives.... Gimme a break! I get it, action movie, not supposed to be real, but, seriously, there is a line that is supposed to be toed.... Once they crossed it, it looks more like a very bad sci-fi movie attempt. They're not just asking the viewer to suspend reality, but to throw it under a flaming bus. Doesn't work. What made the first few movies fun was the possibility of reality..... The type of driving featured, the effects, could be possible, they worked....And the scenes where people are leaning out car windows or sticking arms out of said windows during high speed chases..... C'mon.... They're so badly done, that no even the clothing on the ppl ruffle in the breeze.... Seriously? You lean half your body out the window of a car doing 100+ mph, you're not going to survive, period.... No matter how muscle bound you are.This movie shouldn't have ended in a way that required a sequel..... Really, they need to just stop making movies in this franchise.... It's time to call it quits.... The actors are REALLY showing their age and not in a good way.... It's just not believable to cast them in these types of roles anymore. The G-forces you'd have to survive with so many major car crashes alone --- a body that age wouldn't survive, much less walk away without so much as a limp.Terrible movie..... Feel sorry for anyone who got suckered into paying to see it.","

This movie makes the first Fast & Furious look like an Oscar winning movie by comparison. Where did all the heart go? Where did all the love go? Are these tentpole movies nothing but CGI these days? I don't mind big block busters, but please! For the love of god... write a story the audience will emotionally connect to. Make them laugh. Make them cry. Make them sit in the edge of their seat during the car chases. Failing to do so with the budget they got is an epic failure in my option. Make them feel SOMETHING. It's not only about family. It's about telling a good story, and these producers and directors behind these movie clearly lack the understanding of storytelling to make that happen.","

The deep personality of Han is gone. Dom's sorta brother who was trying to kill him a movie ago is here as a joke.The whole thing is just fan-service delight, to it's detriment.What makes it all the more unsavory, is it takes Fast 5, arguably the best film of the franchise and retcons it to create its new villain.When you start to cannibalise your own material, you need to just stop FFx.Oh, and we get another death resurrection.","

Vin Diesel returns once again as Dom Toretto, the one-time street racer and DVD player hi-jacker, who now had evolved into the dare-devil super spy,Fast X picks up after the gravity defying events of Fast 9, but the plot and characters are springboard off of the now ""classical Fast 5, inserting new addition, Jason Momoa into the footage of the previous entry. The Fast series loves to play fast and loose with continuity, inexplicably carrying on as though Paul Walker's Brian is still alive in the Fast Universe, despite the actor having died in a fiery and harrowing automobile crash in 2013.The Fast crew is now up against Jason Momoa's Dante, the son of the Fast 5's previous victim. Dante is channeling Jared Leto's Joker, a conniving and manically clever criminal out for revenge against Dominic Toretto and his band street racing super spies.At the end of the day Fast X is yet another nonsensical actioner that gets really big and stupid in the end, but it can be a fun ride if you turn off all but one or two brain cells.","

"bottomline","22 May 2023","I'm glad we got free tickets for the 2 + hours of our lives that we wasted watching Fast X. The whole storyline was a mess, and just an excuse for actors like Helen Mirren to appear for a few minutes and pontificate about family. And why was Charlize in this - just so they could throw in a meaningless fight scene. It looks like the writers took all the best elements of the previous movies in the series, chucked them in a blender and hope the end result would be palatable.Well, I can tell you, a Kale smoothie is more exciting than this movie. Having said that, the last 20 minutes or so weren't too bad, and The Rock turning up in the credits was probably the highlight of the whole movie - and maybe even a reason to watch the next instalment. Let's all just hope, pray and keep our fingers crossed that it will be a whole lot better than this disaster.","

"TheDanishMovie-Nerd","12 June 2023","Despite my general adoration for the high-octane franchise that has been the bedrock of action movies for nearly two decades, the latest installment, 'Fast X', feels like a muddled fusion of speed, space and absurdity that overthrows the laws of reality and the franchise's legacy of semi-believable thrill.While previous entries have cleverly balanced the line between outlandish and engrossing, 'Fast X' boldly and unapologetically tosses any vestige of reality out the window. The plot, a madcap scramble of outrageous stunts and over-the-top drama, is exhaustingly ludicrous. As a seasoned fan who even forgave the franchise for launching cars into space with duct tape in the last movie, I found myself straining to keep my disbelief suspended this time around.The underwhelming CGI work and the rushed execution of the stunts further dull the sheen of the movie. These aspects, traditionally the series' strong points, ironically end up being its Achilles heel. The vehicular acrobatics and death-defying stunts, which should provide heart-pounding thrills, come off as half-baked and hastily stitched together, relentlessly pulling the audience out of the movie's flow.The performances range from perfunctory to wooden, with even stalwarts of the franchise seeming to succumb to the weak screenplay. The dialogues, contrived and at times cringeworthy, often feel like clumsy tools to set up the next unbelievable action sequence.However, amidst this chaotic wreckage, there emerges a bright spot - Jason Momoa. His turn as the villain is arguably the movie's sole redeeming aspect. Momoa's portrayal is a masterclass in controlled ferocity and charisma, cementing his place among the franchise's finest villains. This, probably the best performance of his career, almost salvages the movie from the abyss of its own making.In essence, 'Fast X' feels like an unchecked rollercoaster that has thrown caution to the wind, derailing what we've come to love about the franchise. Despite Momoa's commendable performance, the film fails to deliver the expected charm and thrilling fun of its predecessors. It's a letdown for fans, as it pushes the envelope too far, resulting in an entry that is more ridiculous than it is thrilling.","

But previous movies at least had a good writing behind it, and most effects were practical.Here?! CGI everything, even some parts of the buildings are CGI, you can see stretched out low quality texture when Dom stands and looks at Rome from above.The CGI in some parts made me want to scratch my eyes out - like the scene where Dom rides down the stairs in Rome.I thought F9 was the limit, but no... This franchise just keeps going down and down, and despite the fact that this movie was better than F9... It's dumber than F9.I hope that F11 is going to be the last, because Paul Walker, deserved better than this.","

"ashfordofficial","11 June 2023","The first 10-15 minutes or so was enjoyable with nostalgic and emotional moments that reminded me I'm part of the family, again. Unfortunately after that, the story and the direction felt unsatisfying and disappointed. Bizarre character choices and decisions, convoluted twists and turns that felt airless and many characters aren't given much screen time or development. Brie Larson's performance was like someone forced to do something that they're incapable of. She can't act. Jason Momoa is a powerhouse with his tremendous screen presence and infectious charismatic performance. His performance reminded me of The Joker.Unlike previous installments, this film conceived as the first part of a finale with a cliffhanger ending. By doing so, they did some rushed ""shocking"" reveals that ends up confusing and not in a good way.Universal Pictures needs to cut back the budget they're spending on these movies. They could've easily made this movie in $200-250 million range and they opted to settle with $340 million. Also the VFX was most of the time were cheap and phoney looking for an eighth-most expensive film ever made. At the end of the day it's all about profit and I want more installments from Fast & Furious family.","

In any case the special effects team did a very very bad job, I can create more realistic effects in a simple tiktokclip. If you want to make another police academy movie then do not brand it as F and F please. Everything about this movie is wrong, from the characters to the script, the plot, the acting, the story line even the music. It was very painfull to watch after going into the theater with a real F and F mindset. There was not one moment in the movie that was going into a direction that would save it. A perfect way to kill off an A status brand. I surely hope they skip the sequels. Just make a good movie that's all we ask for...","

"jer283","21 May 2023","Even ""Hobbs & Shaw"" had more energy than this movie, and that's saying a lot, considering that movie was somewhat of a flop.I've been watching the Fast & Furious series since it's inception in 2001. At first, it was just street racing with a ""Point Break"" style twist. Then they became more and more like crime thrillers with racing mixed in. Then, it devolved into completely unrealistic crap. The stunts went from exciting to laughable, and this one really took the cake.Jason Momoa, normally a decent actor, is supposed to be the worst villain of them all, but he is laughable as well - playing a flamboyant son of previous Rio crime boss Hernan Reyes. He is not scary - he's just annoying.I'm very disappointed in this series. After Paul Walker's death, it's like they gave up on making these movies likeable. A $300 million budget and still disappointing. What a shame.","

"CinemaClown","13 June 2023","The first in the three-lap finale of the Fast & Furious saga, Fast X does scale back on some of the over-the-top action set pieces that the franchise has indulged in for the last few entries but it continues to retain the ridiculousness of it all, for everything about this latest instalment remains bland, superfluous & unstimulating, only exception being Jason Momoa's manic input that makes this silly ride quite enjoyable.Directed by Louis Leterrier, the story opens by retconning the ending of the best chapter of the series so far to bring its new antagonist into the picture before returning to Dom going on about his moronic sermons on family. Everything concerning the reprising characters is uninteresting, nothing about them makes you care anymore, the stakes don't matter and even the camaraderie of the group has also gone cold over the years.The action often surfaces out of nowhere, for no damn reason and then dies out just as abruptly. The dialogues remain cringe & corny, the supporting cast is more or less a distraction, and the dramatic bits are hilariously awful. Vin Diesel continues to be a lifeless stone as expected. Performances from the rest are just as forgettable. Momoa however brings a magnetic energy and is the only one having fun, as evident in his gleeful rendition.Overall, Fast X is another insipid, incompetent & ineffective sequel in the blockbuster franchise that steers past the previous disappointment solely on the strength of its unhinged villain and makes for a mostly bearable & self-aware chapter despite the hollow & forgettable execution. The film is at its best whenever Momoa is on screen and the actor embraces his role with full understanding of the assignment to effortlessly steal the show.","

"namob-43673","18 May 2023","This movie is messy, and as with most of these Fast movies you cannot expect anything fantastic. But this is also pretty fun, and for a franchise which has got both stale and over the top this is not too shabby.What really save this movie, and elevate it above most other movies in this franchise, are the two additions to the acting team: Brie Larson and Jason Momoa. Both are excellent and show how great actors they are in comparison to everyone else. Brie especially is so good she almost destroy the movie because once you put a Oscar winner and one of the best actresses alive today next to the rest in this movie the other actors almost look amateurish in comparison. Plus Momoa look like he is having a ton of fun. So together those two bring this movie up one or two notches.Another thing which is good (for me) is that the action is more down to earth and ""realistic"" in comparison. To some I assume that is a negative, but for me watching them fly cars out into space and flying between skyscrapers it is very refreshing to almost see something believable for a change.Otherwise this is pretty typical fast and furious and this movie will never win any awards. This is not great nor amazing. This is fast paced loveable F&F fun and entertainment. If you love the previous movies you will definitely love this one too.I give this a very generous 7/10 but at least one extra point for Brie Larson whom I would watch change socks next to a wall of drying paint without feeling shame.Probably second or third best of the franchise and very entertaining, but nothing really special.","

"jimsalter-19695","10 June 2023","For a series that started out fantastically the last 4 were absolute drivel & ""Fast X"" is no different.Apart from the poor acting (particularly when Dwayne Johnson joined) in the series it seems like these people have become super heroes of some sort.It was possible to suspend disbelief at some of the stunts in the earlier movies - at least they were done in real life & not on a green screen with heavy CGI.It seems like the later movies were written & directed by 10 year olds for 10 year olds. No story line of consequence, unlikeable & unbelievable characters, laws of physics don't apply, how do these keep getting made?This instalment is nothing more than a green screen & CGI explosions which look fake. Also a schizophrenic movie which is like 3 different movies that don't work well together.The lack of writing & directing skills in Hollywood is clearly evident in this movie (& the previous 4) along with piss-poor continuityThe only saving grace for this movie is Jason Momoa - he is fantastic & probably the role of his career. He reminds me of Heath Ledger as the Joker (and before anyone has a hissy fit, I'm not saying he was as good as Heath by any means, I'm saying the character reminds me of Heath's character).","

"evilfinal-81386","18 June 2023","First of all, I've never expected anything from this franchise than a popcorn movie, even though it's a big disappointment. The latest installment, 'Fast X,' takes the franchise's descent into chaos to a whole new level. The plot is an absolute mess, resembling a hastily stitched patchwork of half-baked ideas and absurd scenarios.From the opening scene, it's clear that coherence and believability were not priorities for the filmmakers. Instead, they opted for a series of vignettes that lack any narrative flow or logical progression. It feels like the script was written by tossing random ideas into a hat and picking them out one by one. The result is a convoluted and disjointed story that leaves the audience scratching their heads in confusion.'Fast X' is also filled to the brim with ridiculous scenes that defy the laws of physics and common sense. While the franchise has always flirted with over-the-top action sequences, this installment crosses the line into absurdity. We're expected to suspend our disbelief as cars jump across skyscrapers, defy gravity, and perform impossible stunts with ease. It's as if the filmmakers threw any semblance of realism out the window in favor of mindless spectacle.Character development takes a backseat in 'Fast X.' The ensemble cast, which has been a cornerstone of the franchise, feels underutilized and lacking depth. Instead of exploring the dynamics between the characters and their motivations, the film focuses on flashy action sequences and explosive set pieces. As a result, the audience is left disconnected from the characters, unable to form any emotional attachment or investment in their journey.While the 'Fast and Furious' series has always thrived on its entertaining and adrenaline-pumping action, 'Fast X' takes it to an extreme that borders on self-parody. It sacrifices substance and storytelling in favor of excessive spectacle and mind-numbing action. What made the earlier films enjoyable was their ability to strike a balance between thrilling stunts and engaging storytelling, but this latest entry abandons that formula altogether.In conclusion, 'Fast X' is a disappointing addition to the franchise. Its messy plot, vignette structure, and nonsensical scenes leave much to be desired. Fans hoping for a return to the franchise's roots will be sorely disappointed by this lackluster installment. It's a prime example of a series that has lost its way, prioritizing spectacle over substance. Unless you're solely looking for mindless action and can overlook glaring flaws, 'Fast X' is best avoided.","

"mzr-04629","9 June 2023","Ok so I'll try to keep this short,
Thank you to whomever wrote the script and all for keeping the dialogs to a minimum, it kept me from cringing too much.If you got time to kill, if you won't be bothered with ridiculous scenarios and unrealistic action sequences and also no knowledge of computers in the whole team working on this movie. Watch it, it'll help pass the time.Where do I begin?Seeing this movie was like watching a pro gamer use tricks in a video game that make your car fly, help you swim for miles without taking a breath, and spawn back to where you had progressed if you died!!It was basically on the ""it's so idiotic, it's somehow enjoyable"" line.Jason Momoa killed it as a villain, Vin Diesel (I don't know if I'm spelling it right) was more of a Vin Diesel than ever(as in the acting was really bad), the others, well, they were okay on average.The plot would have worked, even with the really silly actions and physics of the movie, if only there was some sort of emotion in the script for the actors to show, I mean why is everyone always calm and collected? No trauma, nothing!!!!Anyways, as I said, it's not bad to kill time if you have enough of it to spare.","

"andrew-87-904401","24 May 2023","I've always been a fan of the franchise. It started as an enjoyable low-budget action flick, almost gritty. The customisation and cruising scene. Point Break with cars. It lost its way a little with parts 2 and 3, which were decent films, but each going in different directions, then found its rhythm with part 4. Parts 5 and 6 were the sweet spot, by which point it had become more of a rival for James Bond or Mission: Impossible.Parts 7 and 8 were more ludicrous, moving into cheesy, Marvel-style, comic book fantasy, but were still entertaining. It was now a completely different animal to what it started out as. Part 9 took that further - into space! - which brings us to X.Unfortunately, this is so ridiculous as to be almost meaningless. There is no tension, consequence or engagement as people and cars can do anything. Physics and mortality do not exist in this cartoon world - characters return from the dead, enemies becomes friends. Without a framework of any kind, not even a coherent story, it's mostly pointless. That's not to say it's unwatchable - with that much money on the screen, it passes the time. But the franchise is well past it's best and I don't see any way for it to recover.","

"arungeorge13","11 June 2023","Wow, they really decided to give this the Avengers: Infinity War treatment with a cliffhanger ending. The emotional stakes in the Fast series is at an all-time low post F9, and that's somewhat the case here too. I'm no longer surprised at dead characters being brought back with silly, non-canonical explanations, and Toretto's godforsaken family is bigger than ever. Foes from past entries becoming friends in the present is just a running gag at this point. After Justin Lin backed out, Universal took a safe bet with Louis Leterrier; someone who's known for fast-paced actioners with a studio backing. He does what he does best - the action is almost relentless, and while it's as over-the-top and unbelievable as it can get, Fast X never falls short of uninteresting (like F9). The set-pieces, though bizarrely inventive, are CGI-heavy, making them flashier but a lot less impactful.The abrupt ending is not the usual route that these films have taken, and that mid-credits scene came off as a surprise. I'm not sure the box office returns have been up to studio expectations, and given the massive $340 million budget, they'd expect at least one of the sequels to make close to a billion. The task at hand is certainly going to be a difficult one, especially given how interest in the franchise is consistently on the decline. The writers really need to work on the cooldown scenes - more than just offering comic relief and describing plot connections from earlier films, audiences need to feel invested in the fates of these characters. At least, they've got a pretty solid antagonist in the form of Dante (Momoa), who always seems to be two steps ahead of Toretto.","

"FilmMining101","4 June 2023","Reviewed by Filmmining101: Two years after the ""Fast 9"" (2021) disaster, ""Fast X"" (2023) in typical franchise fashion, seeks to extend and retcon even further the storyline of the ""family"". Amidst creative differences and ego clashing that led to previous helmer (and screenwriter) Justin Lin resigning, Universal's insistence to make this franchise their own ""Infinity War"" (2018) is pretty clear.Come to think about it, never before has a film series evolved (or devolved depending on where you stand) the way ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001-2023) has. Starting humbly as a street racing and VCR stealing ""Point Break"" (1991) rip off to a blockbuster series filled with drug lords, thief gangs, assassins, dodgy government agencies, warlords, tech billionaires, robbers, globe trotting hackers, Russian armies, and ex-mercenaries is as bonkers as you think it is.Erasing any valid dramatic stakes, every ""family"" member is a superhero, the bodycount and civilian casualties higher than John Woo's ""Hard Boiled"" (1992), nobody is truly dead and each antagonist exists for the sole purpose to join Toretto's ""family"". ""Fast X"" might have a better pace than its predecessor and Leterrier's direction is chaotic enough to at least make this ADHD picture show mildly enjoyable but to describe its paper thin plot will be a testament in vanity. Stretched over two hours and a half, the movie features an amazing amount of filler, gorgeous moments of stupidity (e.g., everyone communicates through the same walkie-talkie including the villain(!), Theron and Rodriguez gas scientists in one moment but there are no bodies afterwards, a car spins around with two helicopters attached to it, shifting gears while on free fall is faster than the gravitational pull of the Earth) and non-stop praise to Diesel's Toretto as the epitome of modern day Jesus, the way Steven Seagal wants it.Do not expect to find the wow factor of the ""Fast Five"" (2011) vault chase or the police car flipping moments of ""Fast & Furious 6"" (2013). Leterrier tries his best to keep things together but he lacks the visual panache of James Wan in the franchise peak ""Furious 7"" (2015). Despite a somewhat entertaining Rome bomb chasing set piece and several mano a mano fights under an endless supply of goons and cars (courtesy of our villain), the rest of the action is infected with blurry and obvious CGI shots.Any charisma that Diesel had is now gone, replaced by gruff delivery and road puns making it impossible to take anything seriously. The rest of the cast act as if they have been handed the roles of a lifetime, their natural comedic chemistry in the earlier installments not present anymore while franchise favs Deckard Shaw and Han are sidelined as extended cameos and nothing more. Amidst this orgy of vehicles, characters and tonal inconsistencies, Jason Momoa's sexually ambiguous and blowing raspberries villain Dante (with an always good view for the on-screen mayhem) is perhaps the most entertaining aspect in ""Fast X"". Yet, as the plot unfolds to reveal a nonsensical ultimate plan, his performance deteriorates feeling direction-less and in the wrong film.The American saying of ""if it is ain't broken, do not fix"" is true and in the case of ""The Fast and the Furious"", Diesel keeps the pedal to the metal where bigger is merely a point of contemplation. Surrounding the audience in a cacophony of vehicular chaos, pseudo life philosophies, flat performances and a villain scheme trapped inside its own impossibility, ""Fast X"" does not have enough gas to finish the race. The retconning of the meaningful and heartful moments in the previous entries through a labyrinth of inter-connected and convoluted plot lines that aim to create a Shakespearean drama based on wheels (really) provides a basis for a cop out. It is time to smile and wave boys, smile and wave goodbye.","

I think it's well time to stop this 'F&F Saga' farce, referring to bombastic special effects, and repetitive obsession concepts (""family"" ...) , in order to catch some new paying spectators. Knowing that there will be some continuation(s) is even more painful.There must be a limit imposed by good taste and certainly by common sense, but I am afraid at Hollywood they ignore such word...","

"subxerogravity","19 May 2023","Even the credits felt like a Marvel movie. This was another milestone for the Franchise like Fast Five in which they officially become Superheroes. Jason Momoa, puts a little too much pineapple on that spices ham but as villains go the Fast & The Furious franchise are definitely Avengers level (in terms of quantity of big bads)
Momoa plays the family of a past Big Bad and in very Helmet Zemo from Captain America, the Civil War way, he puts together a devious plan to destroy Dom's family like Dom destroyed his.Has all the marks for a Fast Formula. The Gang's all here and everyone gets their moment to shine bright which is amazing cause the gang gets bigger every go around. Including the Big Bad from the last movie becoming part of Dom's family.But the best part...This movie is truly like a car going 240 miles an hour and never shows any sign of stopping. The action sequences are epic. This time around Vin Diesel plays more into Dom's impossible feats as they become more normalized in this film.Granted the only downside is that if you've never seen the previous nine movies you may not get everything, but the action is too fantastic not to sit back and enjoy the ride.This totally makes up for Fast 9 which I did not get into, but I think I got to see this movie again and again before it leaves the theatres.","

"mustafadirek7","5 August 2023","Having been a long-time fan of the Fast and Furious series, I eagerly awaited the release of this latest installment. Unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. The film had a number of scenes that dragged on unnecessarily, disrupting the fast-paced tempo I've come to associate with the franchise.What particularly disappointed me was the ending. An ending should ideally provide a satisfying conclusion, resolving plot lines and giving the audience a sense of closure. But in this case, it felt like a letdown. It was, in my opinion, one of the weakest endings in the Fast and Furious series.All in all, this was not the adrenaline-pumping, high-stakes action film I was hoping for. While the film may appeal to some, it did not live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. Despite my disappointment with this film, I remain a fan of the series and look forward to future installments.","

The last films were surreal as well but this was on the top. Because of that, you can't take this movie seriously. Also, its not always the best idea to bring all the stars and characters together. If films wouldnt contain a lot of cliches like 'i know a place', 'just believe and it will happen' it would be more exciting.I enjoyed fast and furious parts for a while but this is the right time to finish the series after the next episode. It is more than enough and they can have a happy ending.","

"jackwoodrup","17 June 2023","Ok Fast and Furious Logic Question.Gal Gadots character was apparently killed in FF6 where she fell and landed on the runway from a great height where the FF crew were trying to take down the cargo plane and The First Shaw Brother (Stathams character Deckard Shaw - the vengeful brother first appeared in FF7).Upon successfully taking down Shaw and the plane the crew later meets up somewhere and are all sad because Giselle (Gadot) didn't make it.However - at the end of FF X Gadot rescues Letty and Cypher (Theron, C) in the submarine from their Arctic prison base.So did the FF crew not go and retrieve Giselles body off the runway after taking down Shaw and his plane in FF6? Did they just get back in the cars and leave and nobody went ""should we check and see if Giselle actually died? She might just have broken legs""All the action at the end of FF6 occurred on the runway, that was where all the crew were and it was where Giselles body would have been.All this talk of family, but not if you die on the mission apparently. In that case it's ""screw you and your corpse, we don't care anymore"".Obviously FF movie logic isn't to be examined too critically but this needed to be said.","

Fast and Furious X is now a product devoid of originality, they always repeat the usual plots. Fast is now an old and overused product. Fast X is repetitive. An overall bellow average movie in a franchise that is way beyond its prime and runs purely on nostalgia.A forgettable film, nothing memorable, disappointing, nothing more to add, they made 10 films of which at least 5 are bad films, this Fast and Furious 10 is yet another bad film in a saga that got tired, a confused saga that I haven't liked for some time, a saga that is disappointing.","

Was there not even one single person to realise that the laws of physics are broken every 5 minutes in every action scene of this movie ??? It can't even be categorised as a sci-fi or a fantasy genre, because the cliche-subject is brought to a ridiculous level. Not to mention, the movie could have been launched during Easter Holidays, because of the resurrection of Gisele.In my opinion, in order to make the future last part to be remembered as the best, I propose to bring into the script The Expandables, Suicide Squad, Avengers and Justice League. It would guarantee the biggest income ever... 😉","

Anyone that hated this took it to seriously and they probably aren't fun to be around Fast X is the ultimate action extravaganza and Jason Mamoa is one of the best villains I've seen awhile. Louis was perfect as director for this since he did The Transporter 1, 2, The Incredible Hulk, Now You See Me and Unleashed all these are great movies that I'd highly recommend! I loved this movie a lot more than expected to, it's got massive budgeted action in the bulk of it, amazing humor, and emotional impacts plus one of my favorite things is when a lot of audience reacts loudly that's worth going to the movies for that.","

"basementbrotherscollectibles","19 May 2023","4/10 @best and that is being kind. It did at least commit to being an absolutely over-the-top ridiculous film, but it made no sense.Here's my ten quick points on Fast X. Mild-spoilers.1) The dialogue is utter garbage. Not even memeable jokes.2) Too many characters. Dom plays his character straight. The women characters are played straight. The other male characters are tag-alongs or campy mccamp, especially Jason Mamoa, who may earn the Razzy for this performance.3) Terrible writing, even for a FF film. I understand this is a FF movie, and I know to lower my expectations, but it seriously does not make sense. You probably have to watch all 9 films right before you go watch Fast X to understand what's happening. It is more of the ""And then, and then, and then, and then"" writing.4) The editing SUCKS. This film was sliced and diced and sewn together with barbed wire. So many scenes have hard cuts to different angles where the characters are in mid-movement, change with jarring facial expressions. It is awful.5) Queen Brie really seems broken by Hollywood. She's still as wooden as they come. How did this lady ever earn $1 billion at the box office and how did she win an Oscar. Zero charisma and zero gravitas.6) The stunts were lacking and resorted to terrible CGI. Worse than even the most self-indulgent Michael Bay films.7) There is a plot line with a kid that really just doesn't fit at all. It is cringe. The kid was fine. He acted like a kid. The situations he's put in by adults are stupid.8) Too long. I started to feel tortured by the end. There is a mid-credit scene that will make your eyes roll into the back of your head and down your throat. NO END CREDITS SCENE.9) I felt some resentment from the people who made this film. Not any of the actors. I legit think they tried their best with what they were given. But I think this was Hollywood saying ""fine you want mindless entertainment. We'll give it to you, and you'll eat the absolute garbage tier we serve you."" They are so bitter audiences don't want their dramas and politics shoved down their throats.10) I will be shocked if domestic tickets sell very much. The only think that might save this film (and franchise?) is the international market.","

"bololsyahputra","23 May 2023","I think most of us don't like fast 9 because it's to nonsense, i mean like really a car that go to space? And guess what they still make things nonsense in this movieAs i said the action is pretty much nonsense, a car that playing with a big ball, a rocket car as you can see in the trailer and other dom's crazy action with his charger. It also extend to the fighting action where a character like Ramsey can take down a fully armored military.The story also feel mediocre, in this movie there are (i think) 5 different POV, but 3 of them is either not interesting or just useless for the story. And sadly the car is nothing special tooAnd the worst part is the ending. Yes the ending isn't there, we don't know if dom died or his team died or what, like they force us to watch the 11 one after this dissapointing movie? For the 11 i will just wait for the pirate or waiting until it show on the tv.","

"alindsayal","1 June 2023","We are finally here, 10 Fast & Furious films have finally hit and can we believe it that Fast X is finally here and I watched it today. This is another of those franchises with interconnecting films and that has made this franchise a bit confusing but here is my review for Fast X. The premise of the film sees the family under attack by a crazy criminal who wants revenge.Main Character
Vin Diesel once again reprises the role as Dominic Toretto. He is exactly what you would think, he says a bunch of silly one liners and he won't stop talking about family. At the end of the day, I just found this performance as functional, it isn't particularly good but you know exactly what you are going to get and we have to deal with it.Supporting Characters
This is one of the biggest supporting cast of all time so I won't be going through everybody just the ones I thought was important.Jason Momoa plays the main villain an I have to say I thought he was the best part of the film. Some will find him so annoying that it goes too much but considering everything else in the film I enjoyed his character and thought he was having a blast on screen. It is nice to see a villain realise how ridiculous this premise is and live up to it in the craziest way.The film spoiled that John Cena would be reprising his role as Jacob from Fast 9 but as a good guy. It has been clear recently that Cena has become a stronger actor, with humour added and he was strong here. He has a great dynamic with a certain other character and it was fun to watch.The issue is that everybody else is pretty pointless. The crew of Han, Roman, Tej and Ramsey is so dull to watch and it is clear that they had very little for them to do but had to force them into something. They even introduced Brie Larson and she is fine but her character is given not enough to work with at all and that is a big let down for her star power.Story
The story does an effective job of showing the mindset of the villain and why he is after Dominic Toretto and the family. It is escalated well and watching this confrontation was what I enjoyed over the majority of anything else here. The film just has way too much into it, mainly the story with the lesser characters such as Roman and Tej which was so dull and mind-numbing, the crew are split up and that is one of the weaker elements of any of these films.The ending though is pretty interesting and I actually thought this had me leaving the cinema in a better mood then I originally was regarding the future of the Fast & Furious franchise.Script
The script doesn't have much too it. The best thing is the guts they show with their storytelling aspirations at the end of the film and the fun that Jason Momoa is having, though I doubt it had much to do with the writing. The film just has all the clichés and for the most part I just think by this point in the franchise it never hits the levels that it has hit in the past.Style
The Fast and Furious franchise has always been willing to push the envelope in terms of big action sequences and although this is one of the calmer films of recent years, it was still fun at times to see things explode for no reason at all. But the pacing of the film is missing, the film tries to do so much that it doesn't do an effective job of making the audience care about the majority of the characters.Overall
Overall, Fast X is an average film. As we get towards the end of this franchise it makes you wonder how they got so much out of it and unless you are a fan of this franchise it most likely isn't worth a watch.Rating - 5/10.","

"colby-32701","16 June 2023","The fast and furious franchise lost all its credibility maybe after Fast 5. The plots, scripting, and acting all became embarrassing, continuity was just non existent and the films just started to become, well boring ... yet we all still watch them. And that is the key reason as to why they keep making more of these moviesFast X is the worst fast film of the lot. Nothing makes sense, everything is defying physics or just plain logic. We all like an action movie, especially the ones that bend the laws of physics but there is a line and this film crosses that line by a mile and is just full on cringe. How many characters keep coming back from the dead in this series ? How many NEW family members are going to appear out of the wilderness, have some sort of beef with Dom and then suddenly become integral to the films ? How many Hollywood superstars are going to make an appearance just for the sake of it ?EVERY action scene in this film has at least one moment of being completely unbelievable. The acting is worse than that of a school play. The 'funny' scenes just make you cringe...I can't even be bothered to continue writing this review as I'm sure most will agree with some of what I'm saying.Once a great set of films has become a laughable and nonsensical series and doesn't deserve the viewing figures it gets.","

Unreal to a point where at times I lost track whether I was watching Fast & Furious or Transformers. The next scene would be from Matrix, then the third from Harry Potter. A mess that only a high schooler would enjoy. Excuse me a high schooler with bad taste. Okay so that would be considered entertainment as well, I agree, but I was least entertained. The drone enabled photography was excellent though, a new genre might be emerging there. Also it was advertised that this is the last sequel. Fast & Furious has mostly been a great show in its past where it portrayed muscle cars and muscle men, but then fell to marvel comic fantastical illusions. If this mayhem was to prevail then thank God it was the last. Down with the curtain now, forever!","

"jp_91","30 May 2023","""Fast X"" is a movie that manages to improve compared to the ninth part that was lousy. This tenth part is bad but manages to entertain in some scenes, the script is flat and with a typical and illogical story that fails to start and ends abruptly without telling anything new. The performances are normal, highlighting only Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster and Jason Momoa as a very peculiar villain. The cinematography is run-of-the-mill without any appeal, the soundtrack is an aural pain, and the digital special effects are pathetic. In short, ""Fast X"" is a bad movie but it manages to entertain in a couple of scenes, this saga should have ended a long time ago.","

"kapikiko","6 July 2023","Even worse than the last one, this time they make the unthinkable and the unnecessary happens in order to inflate the narrative.Momoa is the best at scene despite the ridiculous role given to him. The first half of the film is tiresome the second half, if you get there is even more stupid. The machines (cars etc) are the supporting actors and, together with Momoa, make the rest of the cast completely disposable. Iam trying to remember something to like about this film but they use so many cliches and ideias from the previous chapters that I do not know if I will mention this one or one of the previous ones. Good luck.","

"endemoniada-1","17 May 2023","Yeah... no... I have zero problem turning my brain off and enjoying some stupid silly spectacle, but even then there needs to be something *there*, and in this installment, there just isn't. While Momoa's eclectically metrosexual villain is a treat to watch, stealing every scene he's in, the rest of the cast get absolutely nothing to work with, including Diesel himself who has do his best to look like he's acting while reciting some of the cheesiest, laziest and most unbelievable dialogue of any movie I've ever seen.As for the cars, well... as usual, it's nice to see real cars get real driven, but that just makes it so much more noticeable when the action goes to 11 and the cars are suddenly visibly CGI. Most glaringly, the physics of them are all wrong. Yes, I know what this film's about, but most previous films have had the cars behave like you would expect, no matter how fantastically unrealistic, whereas the cars here feel like they're either weightless or weigh 20 tonnes half the time. It just feels *off*.So all in all there's the usual visual spectacle, albeit with even worse fight choreography and editing than usual, but the script makes the whole thing still feel more like any given episode of some 80s network action TV show. It just isn't good, not even for a Fast & Furious film, and that should tell you something.Might as well wait until the ending trilogy is finished and watch them all in one go. At least that way you get to see the ending this film was rudely robbed of.","

"svanotten","27 May 2023","The last few movies in this series are terrible. The first 6 or 7 movies in this series are worth watching, and many in that group are worth rewatching. This is the first FF movie I ever considered walking out of... and I kept thinking about it throughout the movie. Save your time and money. The cars were not even that cool. They should have stopped making this movie series years ago... but, I'm such a fan of all the first 6-7 movies, I go to the next one just to see what happens... no more. Putting out this bad of a movie mean I'm done ever watching this series. I think 10-12 year old boys will like this movie. I like movies that are plausible, or possible to be real. That make them so good and so fun! This movie everything is SO fake and over the top, we just rolled our eyes and looked at each other all movie long... and I mean that movie was long, terrible movies last for what feels like 5 hours. I wish I had not held it all movie, and just gone to the bathroom... at the end of the movie (with a terrible ending by the way) we looked at each other a sad said, that's it!?!? Skip this movie, pull weeds, and clean out your closet, you will be glad you did.","

"battlecrusadersgames","6 June 2023","This is the 10th + likely last instalment of the popular car franchise, that sadly has got less and less about cars as the series has gone on, but despite that, i had quite high expectations from this. I shouldn't have.The story, (for what there is of it), revolves around Jason Mamoa, coming after Vin Diesel because he killed he's Father 10 years earlier, (or maybe he didn't idk) during the vault heist of the 5th movie, so this movie picks up from that point, sadly that is the best part of the movie, because at least Fast 5 had originality and felt worthwhile, whereas this piece of garbage was a waste of time.Whether you'd enjoy this completely depends on what you want from a movie, if you want action + special Fx, then this is right up there with the best, as the action pretty much never stops the entire way through + the SFX are off the chart, it really is a visual treat. However if you want anything else from a movie, forget it. The story is wafer thin, the acting is sub par for the most part, especially Diesel who seems to drift more into modelling instead of acting with each film. Someone please tell him snarling at the camera is not acting. Worse still is the script, it's so cliche, it's cringy. F+ F has always been a bit tongue in cheek, but this time , it's just embarrassing. However of all of those issues, the biggest problem i have is the ending + without spoiling too much, it's a disaster that left me feeling robbed of my cinema entry fee.On a side note, there's several cameos that are fun.Overall though, despite this having some fantastic action scenes + blisteringly good SFX, when you think of how much is wrong with it, you realise the action just doesn't matter anymore. I think it's time to put this franchise to bed now.","

The special effects in this one devoid of any physics, took the cake.I kept saying RIGHTTTT! Like that action scene is indeed possible. Am i watching a fantasy car ride and why are theses cameos popping up everywhere.So it seems they left it wide open for more sequels and god help us that we need to continue to see this franchise live for another movie.","

"1rxhmdxhm","18 July 2023","I've been a fan of this franchise ever since going to see Fast 1 in theatres with my brothers as a kid. I've stuck it out regardless of how cheesy, unrealistic, and cliché the films have gotten, and despite the fact that everyone around me stopped getting excited for the releases the way I still do.I don't mind the callback to Fast 5, but Jason Momoa's character was laughably bad, even in a franchise that's gotten as out of hand as this one has. He felt more like a clown than an intimidating threat. Brie Larson's character also felt like yet another A-Lister just forced in with no real purpose or benefit to the movie itself. I don't have an issue with the character of Dom's son but I was losing my mind every time they called him Little B, it felt so forced as if he didn't have an actual name, or they legally couldn't call him Brian lmao. They must of really thought they nailed the family feel with that nickname.As I always am for these movies, I'll be stoked next year when the second installment of the finale comes out. It'll be bad, but its still Fast so ill watch and hope its at least better than this one.","

That I never saw it coming and all the references to the past are very cool If you are a fan of action movies or this franchise it will not be disappointed.

"illmor-814-204784","18 May 2023","After previous movies going to space you know before enter the theater that this franchise turn into an ode to exaggeration. And with this movie is exactly what you get. Hyper exaggerated situations but according to the spirit of the movie, is very entertained. If you want to go to the theater to over analyze a plot looking for an Oscar worthy story, save your money. This is about explosions, fast cars and nonsense action scenes and you will be rewarded nicely in such apart. Said that, I lower my rate because of the effects that look kind of rushed (not all of them). Not bad at all, but does not feel precise, does not feel well curated as we are getting accustomed from other action movies during last years. I saw the movie on Imax, landscapes and colors looks fantastic, sound is good but timing of the effects is the bigger sin of this movie in my opinion, no matter how fake you expect this movie could be. The plot is simple but has a very good addition in the role of the villain that for sure is a plus. Is the one that steal the show. Other additions like Brie Larson and Alan Ritchson are welcomed too. The usual crew deliver well and there are some funny moments with Rome as expected. Worth of seeing on theater? Yes. Is very entertained if you are clear about what are you paying to watch for. Worth of any kind of prize? Not at all. There is only one post credit scene but worth to see it. In summary, a popcorn flick for a couple of hours of nonsense entertainment.","

Standard police cars faster than modified super cars. The stunts just get more and more embarrassing with each instalment, not better or more spectacular.It's time they called it a day, but they won't because I'm going to watch the next one no matter how much worse it'll be.","

"Leofwine_draca","8 January 2024","You know what, I've enjoyed this franchise over the years. The last four sequels have all been consistent in terms of quality: they're not great entertainment but they're fitfully engaging and they hold the viewer's attention. Not so with this tenth, criminally bad instalment of the by-now ailing franchise. The pacing is sluggish, the writing particularly poor, and half the film seems to have been made without a director. There are random cameos from returning cast members who have no place in the narrative (hello, Charlize Theron and Jason Statham) and a sprawling, international plot that's merely a backbone for a series of nonsense CGI action set-pieces. And don't get me started on Momoa's annoying villain. I'm glad there's only one more.","

You know it is not action, because in action we are talking about human ,and it's not fiction because Dominic does things out of human ability! He changes physics laws. I am just happy he is dead (of course I wish he is dead). It's Just stupidly ridiculous. I mean for action you can't change physics laws, or this is fiction so in this case Superman can fly instead of driving! I just wish I haven't seen this spending my time on a nonesense . It doesn't matter how much money you spend or how many cars you destroy, you should be believed by the people, and this is not real for a grown up person.

Be warned, this movie is part one of a three part finale of the series-yep, they are going to drag it out a little bit-so it ends on a cliffhanger to set up part two in 2025. Like usual, the stunts are completely outrageous, but they are incredibly fun to watch-remember, it's not a documentary. Newcomers include Brie as the daughter of Mr. Nobody-the head of The Agency that Vin & crew have worked with on occasion-Alan, the new head of The Agency and Jason, the main villain. Jason is the son of a drug lord that Vin & family took out in a previous movie and Jason now wants revenge. Well, he wants to make Vin suffer first and then kill him and Jason plays the part perfectly. He is a great villain and pretty much steals the show. There are some surprise cameos, one in the scene during the end credits-nothing at the very end.It's rated PG-13 for violence, action and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 21 minutes.I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.","

The last good one was fast five, anything else from there was just another movie, another story, another idea but with the same actors and new ones. This is by far the worst, fast 9 was horrible. My god they ruined the franchise. They have to change the titles of the last 5 fast and furious movies, making gravity a joke, CGI and heroic dumb unlogical stunts. I watched it with low hopes and expectations because i know i'm watching a different movie.","

"ajleong-98725","21 May 2023","The storyline is super-thin. It's more like deliberately finding a reason to trigger a series of actions!The pace is good, with continuous action to keep you on the edge of your seat. The fast-moving actions keep the pace real tight!In terms of actions, as usual, FFX delivers what fans have come to expect! It's filled with high-speed chases, gun-shooting scenes, and daring rescues with massive vehicles. However, perhaps we have seen too many of the same kinds, some actions are no longer 'wow' and impressive anymore. In other words, the actions lack innovation and surprises, and are getting weak in visual excitement.There are a total of 4 DC + 2 Marvel actors and actresses in this movie! Cool huh? Due to the big number of casts, the director could hardly give each character substantial time and growth, making some roles redundant. The women are extra, appearing for fun, I supposed! Of all the characters, Jason Momoa carries his role well by creating different a vibe! Without his funny personality, the movie could be plain and boring!The chemistry among the members is somehow lacking. It is more of a solo movie by Vin Diesel, as the gang splits up too fast with fewer actions. Also, the movie emphasizes too much on actions, leaving no time for the storyline and emotional depth.I gave 2.5/ 5.0 mainly for the actions! The series is getting exhausted and weak, without anything new and impressive! For action-goers, it's worth your money to watch all the big actions! BUT if you are demanding for contents and emotional values, it will be a disappointment! Bcoz it is an action movie with hollow content!","

The film fails to overcome the limits of the genre and limits itself to repeating the same situations and the same characters as in the previous episodes. The film is not very credible and not very original, with a plot that merely repeats the same situations as in the previous episodes. Furthermore, the film is not very balanced in the management of the characters and their personal stories. Ultimately an uninvolving film, a film that limits itself to repeating the same things over and over again, nothing new, nothing good, nothing beautiful. Toretto and his family are better off retiring.","

You can fly, fall from the sky and you'll be alright cause the kid said so. And if in the previous movies they did like one or two crazy things per movie, in this one they are doing it for like every 15 minutes. Dumb action just for an action. And only the CGI allows them to bring their crazy ideas on the screen cause there's no way you can film something like that in a real life. The only thing I liked about this movie was Jason Momoa and the way they've written him into the story. At least they've explained why he's a villain. His face during the movie described my every bit of reaction to this ""peace of art"" - I was laughing throughout the whole film. Damn, I just don't understand why people keep making this crap.

"dombernetti","23 May 2023","It is disappointing to watch. The complete escape from reality really ruins a lot of the movie for me. I completed turned off my brain and lowered my expectations but I was still disappointed. 75% of the movie was cool with awesome cars, cool fighting scenes and at times funny jokes. I don't understand the need for these insane scenes of jumping out of planes and other impossible scenarios. They really diminish the rest of the movie for me because I am constantly waiting for something dumb to happen and takes away from the intensity and seriousness of the scene. Every tough situation that would carry a major impact due to the connection you have with the characters is undermined by this insanity they they will escape even the wildest of scenarios. The emotion has complete left the movies due to over the top super hero feel of a once realistic series. Even in super hero movies characters die but in this series you simple will be brought back. Overall I feel these aspects ruin what I would have thought to be a solid movie. The cars were cool, Jason Momoa performance was great and the only reason I gave it 3 extra stars. If the series could get rid of the extra bs make it about racing, chases, fighting and not making the characters immortal it could restore the series to what it use to be in the first couple of movies.","

It is not believeable and the series has gone further and further into just implausible stunts that defy physics and logic. No, two muscle cars can't tow a giant vault (from the earlier movie this one flashes back to continuously). You'd get burning rubber and a rock solid vault. Cars can't fly forty feet in the air and land without smashing their suspensions. Nope nope nope. OK, it's fun, but you can only go so far before it becomes tedious and repetitious. Spoiler: only one, this movie doesn't have an ending. It is totally open to a sequel, and people in the theater I was in actually groaned and started talking at the end, because they couldn't believe it left off the way it did. Very disapointing, and you left the movie on a downbeat. This isn't ""Dune part 1"" where you know up front this is a two parter. It's a gimmick which leaves you frustrated.","

It's really action scenes one after another and the stakes aren't really there since we know Dom and his crew will always come out unscathed.However, Jason Momoa is hands down the best villain in the franchise. He is comical and threatening. Cipher and the Shaw brothers really aren't as threatening as Dante.

Personally, I like the character of 'Jason Momoa' but that's it.

Dom, who again reasserts that his no 1 priority is protecting his family (despite constantly placing them in danger?) goes on the run after being framed by Dante for a terrorist bomb explosion in Rome but looks to seek out Dante.I still enjoy the ludicrous car stuff - boy the suspension on those cars - and this episode is of course full of amazing stunts and effects. The story such that it is featuring endless cameos in seemingly pointless little sub plots is lousier than usual and seems designed solely just give everyone on salary something to do rather than contribute anything to the very basic plot. The whole thing builds to a completely ridiculous climax which is actually a bit meh lining everyone up for Fast X Part 2. Diesel's face and emotions stay, as always, unchanged for the run time in sharp contrast to a wildly over the top pantomime performance by Momoa.

Enter the days of 'let's shoot most things in front of a green screen"" with fake explosions and where everyone are superheroes who escape the most crazy situations, without a single scratch, like being a a car that rolls over 10 times.At least we don't get a car in space this time.They should have stopped with Fast 7, like the 80's huge rockbands, like Guns 'n Roses, Metallica etc should have stopped touring long ago.But I guess another huge paycheck still trumfs integrity and legacy.","

"cgvsluis","23 September 2023","I love the Fast and The Furious franchise but I feel like this film let me down. It is not a standalone, ending in a massive cliffhanger and leaving many loose ends...it felt very much like an in between film, having no real story of its own. Patched together, is the best way to describe this film.So far I have enjoyed every actor brought to the franchise...The Rock, Helen Mirren, Jason Statham, John Cena, Nathalie Emmanuel, Scott Eastwood, Sung Kang, Kurt Russell, etc. I have even enjoyed the villains, like Charlize Theron. This film however introduces two characters that for the first time I didn't like...sadly the first is played by Jason Momoa, who I generally like as an actor but didn't care for in this Chaos or Joker role as a character named Dante and the second is Brie Larson, who played this very flat and boring character named Tess...I am still not really sure why she was added or what she brought to the film, she seemed wholly unnecessary.The locales were not new and interesting...in fact we just revisited places we have already been (Italy, Brazil, Antarctica)and even stunts are revisited...didn't we already see a car driving the wrong way down a dam???My husband pointed out that they have done the dead-not-dead trick one too many times in this franchise. It has really lost its impact.Spoiler*******
Also, I thought the death of John Cena's character, Jakob, was fruitless as he sacrifices himself for what is essentially nothing, it saves neither Dom nor his son...nor does it take out the main bad guy. He seemed too smart to basically commit suicide for no reason. It didn't even take out enough minor bad guys to do any real good. ?!?!?The other aspect that was really disappointing was that our team or ""family"" that they spend the whole film talking about and referencing spent the whole film apart, which as a fan isn't what I want to see. Remember this started as a small crew who pulled off robbery heists together, lived like a family, and had a passion for fast muscle cars.How far we have gotten away from what it's all about...and for me that isn't a good thing. I thought the last film might be the worst of the bunch...but I may have to offer this one up. Not a recommendation unless you really are a hardcore fan of the franchise, like me. Oh! And if you are going to use a giant rolling ball bomb you should really have the brand Acme painted on it and have Wiley Coyote involved in the dastardly plot.","

This storyline is terrible, the writing is so cheesy and awful it feels like it was written by a second grader, the acting was absolutely trash and the cgi was that of GTA San Andreas. I also don't understand what the point is of making these movies so unrealistic it would barely make sense in the marvel universe. Please don't go see this movie, it is honestly disgraceful to the original films.","

"wvwwbzbxtq","23 June 2023","I don't even know where to begin. I have loved all of these movies from the beginning, albeit the last one got a little too comedic and stupid with the whole pace aspect. They should have called it quits after that. This movie literally feels like a Fast and Furious parody! Ridiculous story lines, generally good and some great actors who forgot every acting skill...you might have to watch it to really believe how bad it is....even Paul Walker is embarrassed! There aren't many movies that I can't make it through, but this was painful. We put on Extraction 2 instead, so I highly recommend that if you are looking for some quality acting and edge of your seat entertainment! P. S I still love you John Cena.","

"noawareness","11 June 2023","This franchise used to be stupid yet fun, now there is no fun. You can just feel how much control Vin Diesel has and how invested he is in his character and image, which seems to be the basis of these films these days.I can't bear how there are no consequences. Everyone who has ever died, comes back to life, everyone who was once bad is now good and no one can ever get one up on the absolute genius that is Vin Diesel.Jason Mamoa does his best to kill off anything redeemable that this franchise had left by channeling the Bollywood rip off of Heath Ledgers Joker and fails in every single way. This franchise literally has nothing left and as long as Vin Diesel holds as much clout as he does, it will only get worse. I absolutely hate this film and anyone who has any form of intelligence should hate it too. I'm convinced that the only type of person who could genuinely like this trash, is the type of person who doesn't have a brain to switch off.","

"housermichael","19 May 2023","I am not a huge fan of ""The Fast and the Furious"" series but I did see ""F9 the fast saga"" two years ago when it came out and thought it was fairly entertaining and a good action movie.Now we have ""Fast Ten"" and I thought it was a better film than the previous entry. As an action movie it is not as good as ""John Wick Chapter Four"" which I think is the best movie of this year so far.This movie was directed by Louis Leterrier who directed the remake of ""Clash of the Titans"" from 2010 and ""Now you see me"" from 2013.The large cast includes Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Jason Statham, John Cena, and Jason Mamoa, who makes a great villain.Plus four Oscar winning actresses; Charlize Theron, Rita Moreno, Helen Mirren, and the beautiful Brie Larson. The actors are likable and charismatic.The plot is just an excuse to set up the action scenes. And there is a lot of action. Car chases, hand to hand combat, shooting, and lots of explosions. The action is outrageous and nonsensical and borderline cartoonish. But also entertaining.The film is kind of long at almost two and a half hours. But it keeps moving and is worth seeing on the big screen.","

"nogodnomasters","2 June 2023","SPOILERS: The film opens with a redo of the vault scene which ignored all drag coefficients. Inserted into the sequence (which BTW flashes back to Paul Walker again) is Dante a flamboyant criminal played by Jason Momoa. He wears a bun and likes the color purple. He doesn't have a wife or girlfriend if that means anything. He is the son of the Brazilian criminal we didn't know he had, like when they suddenly tossed John Cena into a film as Toretto's kid brother. We then jump to the sickening sweet family diner scene which is normally at the end of each film (bad omen) where they hug each other and say they are all family. The action starts when Cipher (Charlize Theron) arch enemy of the group shows up at Toretto's door. She lets him know that Dante is after him and anybody he knows. Dante says, ""I don't want to control the world, I want to punish it."" Part of the crew is in Rome on a fake mission set up by Dante. They race there to help as the film splits into subplots.Dante stays one step ahead with his planning and Torreto's ability to react saves them at the last minute. If you watched or heard about ""John Wick 4"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy 3"" then you know this series is part of the trend to end current series either in their present form or permanently. This film appears to be the first part of such a film as based on what we see in this film, it will not go back to the way it was in the first nine features. Brie Larson has a role as the daughter of the former head of the agency which BTW has ours heroes wanted for what happened in Rome. Brie is acts as the same self-assured talented character as Captain Marvel. I really expected her to show off her driving skills. The film still has the funny banter as the others in spite of the tragedies.Guide: unlike Wick or Guardians there is no swearing.","

The cars driving in the tunnel as Mamoas character steals the Son, TIE FIGHTER sound effects.How they just straight up using very obvious Star Wars sound effects in the movie.The movie itself is just so disjointed, what are half the characters even doing, one minute dim is being told Brian and Mia are safe, but the next scene Mia is with dons son at his house and get attacked. Where's Brian?Jason stathum turns up for a scene, loads up a lot of guns says a ""cool"" line about killing people. But he's out of the whole movie now.Cars fall out of planes from great heights, dons fine tho, car isn't wrecked either.And the kid KILLS a lot of henchmen, and laughs about it with his uncle Captain invisible. Who dies in a fireball. Oh well he will be fine and back next movie along with every other character who dies and comes back a few movies later.Seriously after going to space I didn't think the logic would get any worse.

Not sure they add anything to the final product. The writers have made a mash of a story, very lazy. A few good comedy scenes, but not really enough. The action scenes are good but the stunts have become so unbelievable in the last couple of films. The writers have tried to keep to how the Fast and furious series has become, but still the ending ruins the film for me. Doesn't even really complete the story of this movie, leaves it without a real ending. Hopefully the sequel will be better.","

The plot is nonsensical, the characters are bland, and the action scenes are boring and repetitive. The movie has no logic, no emotion, and no creativity. The movie is so bad that it makes Poop look like a masterpiece. Poop, at least, had some humor and originality in its premise of a sentient feces that tries to save the world from an evil toilet paper company. Poop had some charm and wit in its dialogue and animation. Fast X has nothing to offer but cheap thrills and clichés. It is a waste of time and money that should be avoided at all costs.

"kosmasp","24 May 2023","No pun intended - and I have to give credit where credit is due: the summary head line is one a very famous interviewer for BBC 1 came up with. He does some great interviews which can be viewed on Youtube too. He asked some of the cast if they'd consider calling the tenth installment ... well you see what. 10 movies - that does not include the Hobbs and Shaw one off or spinoff or whatever it is called. And as far as I understand, there are supposed to be more spin offs in the future ... until then Vin Diesel wants to finish off the main story.That said, this was supposed to be ... well there was only supposed to be another one of these. So 11 should have been the last one ... Vin suggested that there may be a 12th. I know that some have become numb and feel indifferent about the franchise. And that is ok - for me, they grow on me. Actually I may even rewatch the other ones and rate them a bit better than I did after the first time I saw them. If you think this is not for you, there is a simple solution: do not watch them.And hey I would get it ... there are so many things that don't make sense (laws of physics be damned and many other things that just wouldn't happen in the real world) ... and then there are story threads that are just left ... to die alone I reckon? There are recurring characters here that I assume most would not expect to see again (unless someone spoiled it for them) ... and then there are characters in this, that are in it for a minute and then they seem to vanish ... Scott Eastwood ... there may be some deleted scene that explains his situation, but ... well the good thing I reckon is, that the movie is quite fast (and furious - and crazy by the way) ... so you may not notice. If Speed had the bus going 40 or so miles an hour, this one has quadruple the speed ...or more. Not all the time - it starts off with reminiscing or rather rewriting one of the most insane scene the franchise has given us ... well which one do I mean? I know there are so many ... well it is the safe scene and if you are aware of the franchise you know what I mean.It is about introducing Aqua... I mean Jason Mamoa to us. He is quite ... well he is not right in the head. There is an evaluation that we hear during the film ... but we don't need it. And Jason has quite a lot of fun with his character. Which is love it or hate it ... really out there. Again do not try to make sense of his masterplan ... you won't be able to do that. You might be surprised about a particular scene of his though ... that is quite dark - didn't expect to see something like that in a PG13 movie ... not complaining, just baffled it made it through ... rotten and dark humor setting a tone for him ... not consistent, but that's also a consistency I reckon.Family is a big part ... and the extended family is again in danger ... but the movie is aware of some of the criticism too ... and plays with that ... well people being friendly with our crew ... or dare I say family? I mean we have come to love them, haven't we? No matter who and no matter how they were introduced ... and how they turned out ... this installment feels like it has more hand to hand combat (or feet for that matter) than previous movies. But I may be wrong about that ... what I do know: it ups the ante once again ... and we do end up on a cliffhanger ... almost literally. That said, be aware of another mid credit scene (the one from the last movie does get picked up upon and resolved during the run time this time around) ... the stakes are high ... and there is another pun here that I won't touch, maybe your mind is as twisted as mine and you can see it for yourself ... which is also true for the movie ... it can be fun if you let it ... take the passenger seat and go on a ride ... the road to the end begins ... or something like that, right?","

"ykjdh","19 May 2023","This is the kind of movie you already know what you're seeing walking into it. The series has been going on over 22 years now and basically has not only become a lesson in believability but a commercial for the latest Dodge cars and trucks. Is it bad movie? I'd go further and say compared to what? This is an action movie loaded with bad guys vs good guys, good fight scenes, hot chicks, stunts and a decent soundtrack. If you're expecting believability and are just a sensitive spazz then this one isn't for you.For the rest of us who just want to enjoy a movie without comparing everything to Shakespeare then you'll have a good time. This time around the villain is clear if you've watch the trailer. Not to give much away but where Jason Statham was supposed to be a supervillain, Jason Mamoa has him beat. Dude is relentless in pursuit of revenge for what happened in Fast Five except it was Hobbs who was responsible for everything. I mean Vin and crew did steal 100 million but they didn't kill the dad of Mamoa's character. Bottom line this is enjoyable and sets up the finale which will be out in a few years. Btw stick around for the end credits.","

Don't get me wrong, I don't like the performance of Jason Momoa either. I think he is trying to imitate Jack Nicholson in Batman, but he's totally wrong for the job. It is one of the worst movies of the series and I am convinced that the sequel will be the same, unless some miracle happens. The only gratifying moment was John Cena's scene on the freeway.This proves that a large number of movie stars does not guarantee the success of the picture.","

"demonblade-37792","20 May 2023","The first impression of Fast X is that it is very entertaining to say the least. The cinematography to cars driving insanely fast to almost every part on the world and cars blowing up is visually pleasing. The acting and choreography by everyone is entertaining especially Jason Momoa. Jason Momoa delivers the antagonist role very well that he is a memorable character in the Fast franchise. A con that I have with the movie is that half the action scenes are unbelievable. It defies reality that it is stupidly insane and cheesy at the same time. Director Louis Leterrier made sure that Fast X was going to be a memorable entry in the franchise with surprising cameos. I cannot wait for Fast 11 on the way. Overall, Fast X is good with its acting, story, and entertainment. I would recommend it to watch it in theaters for a good action watch.","

"FeastMode","19 May 2023","I am a huge fan of this franchise. Here are my ratings for reference:(1) Original - 8 stars.(2) 2 Fast - 7 stars.(3) Tokyo Drift - 3 stars.(4) Fast & Furious - 7 stars.(5) Fast 5 - 8 stars.(6) Fast & Furious 6 - 8 stars.(7) Furious 7 - 4 stars.(8) Fate - 8 stars.(9) Hobbs and Shaw - 2 stars.(10) F9 - 1 star.The headline to my review for F9 is ""R. I. P. To a fun franchise."" I had originally intended not to watch any more sequels. I reluctantly gave Fast X a chance. But I went in with rock-bottom expectations.To my surprise, I enjoyed Fast X infinitely more than F9. It hooked me instantly and I found myself smiling quite often. They do a great job setting up a cool and memorable villain. He may be borrowing a little too much from the Joker but I found it entertaining.I was about 45 minutes in and nothing outrageously absurd had happened. By comparison, F9 had around 18 eye-rolling moments in that timespan. Now we do start to see it in Fast X. There are multiple scenes that had me cracking up at how dumb it is. But overall, I see it as 30% of the absurdity from F9.Now while I was entertained for most of this movie, there are multiple other flaws. There are numerous moments that look so fake with obvious CGI. So much that happens makes no sense if you think about it for more than a second. It's written stupidly frequently and they assume people won't notice or care. CinemaSins will have a field day with this one.But my biggest issue with this movie is it's not a whole movie. I find out after that it's meant to be part of a trilogy. But I've seen trilogies before. Usually each movie is able to stand on its own. Fast X is part 1 of a really long movie. The next two should not be called Fast XI and Fast XII. They should be called Fast X part 2 and 3.I was wondering why I couldn't tell where we were in the movie (ie. Middle of second act, start of third act, nearing climax, etc). And when the credits popped up, I was completely stunned. So much is left unresolved. It's not just a case where they maybe spent too much time setting up the sequels. There are entire plot threads dangling. It doesn't have a conclusion. Nothing feels finished.Even with all that complaining, I came out of this much happier than I expected. I think I will consider everything beginning with F9 to be non-canon, especially with how they keep messing with past story details. If you liked F9, you will probably love this. Just go in knowing you are watching part of a movie. Hopefully it makes it easier to digest.(1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 5/18/2023)","

"southdavid","10 June 2023","I've lost track of how many more films there are going to be in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, but I made it to the cinema this weekend to see the tenth film (not counting ""Hobbs and Shaw"") and, whilst it doesn't have an actual ending, it was again a good time.Cipher (Charlize Theron) arrives on Dominic Toretto's (Vin Diesel) door to warn him that Dante Reyes (Jason Momoa), the son of former adversary Hernan Reyes (Joaquin De Almeida) is out to destroy his family. Upon learning that a mission that Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludicris), Han (Sung Kang) and Ramsey (Natalie Emmanuel) are undertaking in Rome is, in fact, a trap, the rest of the team try to save them but are framed for a terrorist act and driven underground. With the help of Mr Nobody's daughter Tess (Brie Larson) Dominic is given a chance to go on the offensive.By now, we're at the point when you know what you're going to get from these films. Expensive stunts where the laws of physics don't really apply, lots of mumbling about family and a villain who will be their best friend in the next one. That this film actually calls itself out on some aspects of this predictability is probably to the films credit, and there is a twist in this, using this prior knowledge, that I genuinely didn't see coming. The stunts, visual effects, etc all are reasonably good, even if perhaps some of the fire effects are a bit disappointing.The story divides all the 'family' up into their own subplots, some of which are better than others. John Cena inexplicably (but welcomely) decides to forget the personality he had in the last film and instead play his character like Peacemaker and his scenes are great. Contrast that with the Roman, Tej, Han and Ramsey scenes, which involves some of the least natural and least compelling banter ever committed to celluloid, and that's before the highly unwelcome Pete Davidson cameo. The films MVP though is Momoa, who plays his character like he's the Joker. Undercutting the pretend masculinity of the series, with a fun, occasionally psychotic and always camp performance. He has one scene in this film that I think is perhaps the most surprising thing that the series has ever done.Overall, I feel positively about the film, even if the decision to split this specific story over multiple film feels unnecessary and there are bits of the storyline that work better than others.","

"grlym-46849","10 June 2023","To preface:I really enjoyed the original movie. The 2 sequels after were sounds great. I love you. See you later, but not spectacular. So the franchise reinvented itself into a spy / marvel movie universe. And in the beginning it was great, but then lunacy of just how far unbelievable could go....yeaSo I take these movies for what they are. They turned into 80's macho movies. And I'm ok with that. Hollywood has always delved into the absurd and unbelievable. Then the movies morphed into marvel esque superhero stunts and abilities and I still enjoy them. Are they fantastic movies ?....no. But they entertain. An inclusive cast has made more people become fans and that keeps them going because Hollywood can't ignore profits like this.Just wondering why this movie had no ending given the fact this was supposed to be the end.The post credit scene with the Rock...shows that money grabs are more important than a diesel- rock macho feud. And with no ending, we are forced to watch the next movie with the rock...which Honestly is good for him...since he has come off bad a person since destroying DC movies and some careers. But regardless, as long as he makes good movies, we will all watch.All that aside,...it's a good action flick. Decent effects. Very long movie but doesn't feel like it because of the pace.This is definitely an ""Expendables"" movie as nearly every very big name gets a role in This movie.I just hope they don't spend with a Shaw movie. As Hobbs is just the rock playing the rock. And I've seen that movie to the T too many times.","

I was very wrong. I was bored and waiting for it to be over. Rolled my eyes at least a dozen times. Stolen lines from other movies, bringing long since dead characters back *AGAIN* and what exactly were we meant to think at the end? What a terrible way to end a movie - presumably to create another - which I won't be watching.Been a fan of Jason Mamoa since SG1 and I've never watched him as a villain.

"julianvargas-216-67657","28 May 2023","Fast and Furious, once a franchise that promised high-octane thrills and heart-pounding action, has now become a victim of its own excessive ambition. With each installment, the series seems to detach itself further from any semblance of reality, resulting in a mind-boggling experience that borders on absurdity. Regrettably, the latest addition to the franchise, deserving a meager 2 out of 10 stars, follows suit in this regard.From the outset, the film throws logic out the window in favor of extravagant stunts and physics-defying maneuvers that are far beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelief. The spectacle, initially amusing, quickly becomes tiresome as the story progresses. Characters survive impossible situations unscathed, and the laws of gravity and common sense are blatantly disregarded.What was once an entertaining escapade with a touch of reality has transformed into a circus of spectacle, where the boundaries of possibility are stretched to their breaking point. Fast and Furious, in its relentless pursuit of delivering jaw-dropping action, has lost touch with the core elements that made the earlier films enjoyable.While some may argue that the franchise embraces its own brand of over-the-top entertainment, there comes a point where the lack of coherence and rationality become downright ridiculous to the eye and mind. The filmmakers seem more concerned with pushing the limits of plausibility than crafting a compelling story that engages viewers on an intellectual level.In conclusion, Fast and Furious receives a disappointing 2-star rating out of 10. It is a prime example of a series that has lost its way, prioritizing mindless spectacle over a coherent narrative and believable action. Unless you're a die-hard fan of the franchise or seeking mindless action devoid of logic, it's best to steer clear of this latest installment.","

"AlexLyh","22 May 2023","In short: Jason Momoa mocks Jack Sparrow. Good guys are invulnerable. Action is pointless and doesn't give you any feeling of compassion..
SPOILERS ALERT
.The first act must have shown us how evil and dangerous the bad guy is. But his evil plan didn't kill any person of the Dom's team. Zero! So why should we even be scared of the bad guy?!.
After the first act we see a bunch of pointless fights that we don't care about. Everyone fights with everyone. Tyrese Gibson fights with Ludacris. Charlize Theron fights with Michelle Rodriguez. Jason Statham fights with Sung Kang. And guess what - we don't care..
Finally, we have a messy third act that ... doesn't end. Jesus on the wheel, will we have Fast 11?!?!?!!? No, God, please no..
And yes, nobody died. It seems that Jason Momoa is a dvmb bad guy because he spoke so much and eventually didn't kill anyone. Ha ha..
Okay, one guy died, but again - we don't care because he appeared only in Fast 9..
P. S. I'm curious whether the director understands that his audience is adults, not teenagers, that grew up on this franchise..
Small example: in the third act, he spectacularly showed how nitrogen is released into the engine and gives acceleration. Such a special effect worked in Fast 2, but not now, when we are already 30-50 years old. The director absolutely does not understand that his audience is adults. That's why Tom Cruise will succeed.","

"Drawmort","18 December 2023","I hope that one day there will be an action movie with the same spectacular sequences that Fast X has, but with a smart plot. This movie feels like an eternal (because yes, it's very long) collage of many action scenes with no coherence between them. The action is entertaining until it becomes too far-fetched. The plot is a mere decoration and excuse to show the millions of dollars in CGI, cars, explosions and cameos that contribute to the emptiest vanity of cinema. The acting is terrible, with the exception of the main villain, who, don't get me wrong, is far from anything remarkable, but at least he is a cut above the rest. By the way, that character development is the weirdest thing I've ever seen.Now, as incredible as it may seem, I must highlight something. The direction is quite interesting. It enhances in a good way each adrenaline sequence that the film calls for at every moment. The soundtrack is also quite decent and well, I think I have already praised the visual effects quite a bit.Recommended to leave the background and peek out only in the noisiest scenes, as it's surely due to some visual spectacle full of cars and explosions.","

"dps-87187","30 June 2023","I've been a casual fan of the Fast series for some time. Not a die hard, but I've seen about 6 of the movies with Tokyo Drift being my favorite. My wife and I have been huge fans of the 4DX experience and thought a movie like this would benefit from that kind of viewing. The newest Jurassic Park and Top Gun were awesome in these venues.Now I realize the Fast series isn't at all some Russian-novel-esque kind of plotline but the movies always had a decent undertone despite all the flamboyant action. We got NONE of that from Fast X. This movie was so poorly written, we actually left 30min before it ended. It had no plotline that was any bit interesting to have you care about what was going on. I'm kind of sick of them trying to make Jason Mamoa a thing, he's good in small doses in movies but I really don't think he's meant to hold a role this big. He's lately just playing the psychotic bad guy now that he looks like a grizzled biker gang guy, a big departure from his early days on GoT when he was some heart throb for the ladies.This movie was incredibly disappointing as it felt like the action scene was written first and they filled in whatever dumb back story could mildly work to support the scene. I give this movie 1 star as even watching it with all the glitz and action of 4DX couldn't save it, I couldn't care less how it ended hence why we just left before it ended. Do not waste your money and see it in theaters unless you have an IQ of 80 and you're fine with no tangible plot.","

"furiousdevi","9 June 2023","I was really looking forward to the new Fast X because i was hoping they learned from past mistakes and take the series back to where it belongs - with cars as main focus and maybe lead into a new story, a new beginning - because thats what we fans want!Instead we get a horribly written story where alot of things dont make sense - at all!And on top we get laughably bad animations at least when it comes to cars (like when they drive down stairs etc.).A real shame that the series still keeps getting worse ... they keep ruining it and it hurts.4 Stars is really the maximum a fan can give here - its so hard to watch. Someone who does not know the previous (good) movies in the series its probably more like a 6/10.","

"nadkarnisumeet","21 May 2023","Fast X review :First things first. The Fast and Furious franchise is critics-proof as its strong fan base would anyway watch it without bothering about a review. Quite like a Salman Khan film of Bollywood! So, digging deep in to its 'intolerance' towards logic or physics would only be an exercise in futility!!This time, the focus is on family apart from the regular car chases. Trust me, you will hear the word 'family' at least ten times during its two hours of runtime. Vin Diesel has certainly come a long way from part one of this series, which always manages to up the ante on the action front with every sequel. The action sequences are truly awesome with the plot cleverly woven in to an emotional bond between Diesel and his kiddo. Jason Momoa as the main antagonist, is fantastic.As an icing on the cake, there is a wonderful Paul Walker tribute and a surprise package in the end credits which indicates a further sequel. Bring it on. Fast!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.","

"Hussain-AL-Naseer","27 May 2023","Fast X stretches the already far-fetched franchise to its limits with nonsensical actions and an overemphasis on mindless action. Characters die and miraculously return with every new movie no wonder Vin Diesel would bring Paul Walker for the finale part. Jason Momoa's villainous role showcases his screen presence but uncomfortably resembles the Joker, lacking originality. The film becomes a below-average entry, offering nothing new to revitalize the series. It disregards physics entirely, pushing the boundaries of believability to absurd extremes. Fast and Furious 10 relies heavily on familiar tropes, delivering a predictable, formulaic experience.","

"cruise01","20 May 2023","5 out of 5 stars.Fast X is an awesome action film that is big and over the top insane. Fast X is the beginning of the end for the series. Which the plot is coming full circle. With a new villain Dante (Jason Momoa) who is hellbent on destroying Dominic (Vin Diesel) family and causing chaos to whoever gets in his way. Dante is coming at full vengeance to see Dom suffer. While Dom and his team are trying to survive being betrayed. Chased and while trying to protect each other.Jason Momoa is an awesome villain. Who is like the joker for the Fast series. The action sequences are big and over the top insane. If you can set aside logic or laws of Physics cause its like the previous films. You can enjoy it for what it is. The visual effects are good. The music score and soundtrack is awesome. The climax of the film is more personal with its action scene only focusing on Dominic and Dante.The cast ensemble is great. Bri Larson and Alan Ritchson is also good. The film ends in a cliffhanger for a sequel. And a surprising ending on one character. Which is better to keep an open mind with these kind of films. And a mid credit scene that just adds more to the surprise.Overall, Fast X is an exciting thrill ride that is a perfect summer blockbuster.","

"A-Lost-Soul","1 January 2024","It is not like the previous movies have been amazing but this one was so bad that no one who was involved should have made money from it...not including my $3 rental cost. This was like a recipe made by someone who has never cooked and guesses at the ingredients and portions after sticking their finger to taste it. How about this for the next movie, we find out Hobbs is really the father of Little B?Nothing made sense about this movie. Frankly sick of how Mia is always involved but never her and Brian's kids which would have actually made sense to play with Little Brian when he was at her house. At least bring back Owen because he was more of a competent villain since you brought back Gisele but somehow left out Elle - was she not tough enough.Since you added Brie Larson, how about have Nick Fury show up with her Captain Marvel costume since doing stupid is the premise for this one and the plan for the next. Here is one even better, let's have Paul's brother join the cast and say Brian had to get his face changed since her was a UC and needs to protect his family. Here is another idea, Twinkie and Sean are now selling flying cars and have started...wait for it...space wars. Oh yeah, we have to not forget that Dom and his son will grow gills and swim underwater while waiting to get picked up by the sub that comes all the way from Antarctica. If looking for more idea, you know where to find me you sumabitch.I am knocking this movie down another star for the inconvenience of watching the forcing me to write this review.","

"ArunWalls87","26 May 2023","Why do they do this again and again. It's no more about the original intention of the movie anymore. Fast cars and family.I think they lost it after the tokyo drift. The movies from there on is more about money heist, anti-gravity, breaking all the laws of physics.It's unreal action. Unreal scenarios. Guardians of the galaxy is a much more watchable movie considering the fact that this franchise has jumped the genre.Heard that this was the first part of the last movie.Should have stopped with this. But considering the fact that there is only one more to endure, just bring it on and be with it.","

"Hey_Harry","19 May 2023","Fast X is reportedly the first in a three part finale and it definitely shows. Fast X spends a bulk of its first and second act setting the stage for the next two films in the series introducing new characters as well as bringing back characters from the previous films. The pacing in the first and second half are all over the place and it's really not until the third act where the movie starts to pick up and it feels like the movie is going somewhere. Unlike the previous entries in the series, the movie barely focuses on Dominic's gang doing heist missions and instead focuses on the personal vendetta between Dominic Toretto and the series' new villain, Dante Reyes, played by Jason Momoa whose larger-than-life performance helps reinvigorate the franchise. Overall, Fast X is not perfect but still contains plenty of cool cars, slick action, stylish editing, unique set pieces, as well as some decent character performances to keep the film on track.","

"mason25","23 May 2023","I can fully accept it being a popcorn action flick, but it's deviated so far from the first installment that it's not even funny anymore.I seen the first one something like 9 or 10 times in theaters, absolutely loved it despite it's few minor realism flaws, but now we've gone to outer space and back.I can even accept the ""re written"" history to give us our evil villain in Momoa, but what the actual F were they thinking making him be Jack Sparrow????? It simply didn't fit at all.All of the globe trotting was utterly pointless, and there was next to no sense of belonging or attachment in any place.Brie Larson came out of nowhere, and simply didn't fit.Ditto for Momoa.Aimes, anyone could've guessed he'd be a traitor, no issues with that but you can't tell me that the shadowy board of figures didn't know who he was all along.... maybe they just like handing out cutting edge technology (as exhibited on Mr. Nobody) to random terrorists, but it makes no sense.Jacob coming back was great, his death was beyond stupid, to say nothing of his car ""mods"".Speaking of cars.... in a franchise that began all about cars, and until now had more than a few throw away lines on WHAT they were driving, and how they had been modded, they're now just relying on us to KNOW what's on screen at a glance. Which for myself is great, there's hardly a car shown that I can't at least put a manufacturer's name to, if not an actual model with rough hp/tq figures. But what about folks who are just coming to see an action movie??Also there's never a single moment where there's any feeling given for any of the cars, we go traipsing around the globe at a breakneck speed yet somehow everywhere we go, there's for sure a dozen or more 1000 hp cars available.... are we to believe that the team has these cars pre modified and sitting around just waiting for them to land at every airport.... OR that extensive highly technical mods have been performed all in the time frame of said flight from A to B...Momoa had his stuff all planned out, so of course he's got his things around the world (ridiculous but ok), but in every other scene he's got a new jack Sparrow outfit on, and he's more flamboyant than a drag show of craziness.Gisele is back because she only fell out of a plane from 30 or so feet up, maybe more maybe less, I'll even accept that she landed in a pillow factory on that 30mile runway. But where tf has she been all this time? You can't tell me that they didn't go back and recover her body to actually confirm that she was dead/alive....The long term fans will definitely finish out watching the series, because why wouldn't they, they've been with it for 20+ years, and we do like action flicks, but they certainly won't be going back again and again to see it like I did with the first one. It's a watch it and forget it popcorn movie.","

"statuskuo","29 May 2023","Anything that uses the Roman Numeral (Oooooh I get it now) ""X"" as a sequel indicator is bound to go all camp-out (""Jason X"" anyone).So as the 10 year yard mark hits, you would expect this flick to be a lot more...groundbreaking. It isn't. It's a very straightforward, sometimes dull ""family"" diatribe story. Of revenge from ""Fast V"" (see what I did there?)
Here Toretto seems to have short term memory. And also never mentions Brian (Paul Walker). Though he's featured in the opening sequence. The character of Dante (Jason Mamoa) seeks revenge after these two street racers kills him by swinging a safe and hitting a car into his Pop. Seriously.That said, Mamoa is flat out the best thing in this. He seems to understand the joy of camp. He's effeminate without being obnoxious and swings as a person who is sociopathic. He takes glee in his revenge plan. Though the stunts he sets up make zero sense. Supposedly he is a computer genius and a street racer. But he does have help, which is suppose to be some kind of surprise.This entire movie felt like a reveal that, if you aren't a follower of the Fast series you wouldn't know why they were important. Also, I can't remember which franchise John Cena is in. But he arrives with a bang. As does Charlize Theron, as does Jason Stratham, as does Helen Mirren (really after the bang) as does....etc...I think you see my point.The core support group Tyrese, Ludacris, some British hottie chick and Kang... they seem to be on their own adventure. Not sure why this adventure starts with Tyrese trying to be more a leader. There is a cameo of Pete Davidson that falls flat. And has no other reason to be in the movie that is already bloated as Vin Diesel is getting. Ooooo...catty of me, I know (think of this in Dante voice).Any way, Universal is clearly shoehorning their superhero franchise into this over 20 year silly concept. Is it smart? Kinda. They have nothing else. And the dead keep rising. And people betray each other (waiting for Michelle Rodriguez to turn on ""the family"").Ridiculous as all of it may be, you know going into it, you turn off all sense of science.I hate movies that aren't complete. ""Mission Impossible"" is going to do the same thing. It's painful. Just stick to television if you're going to pull that.","

"gojosatoru-90006","5 July 2023","Honestly the movie is good to kill some time. The problem for me is how introduce relatives of characters without even being mentioned once. The acting was good by the actors but the CGI in so many places was so bad it was hilarious. And just let dead characters stay dead would you. It's like they have dragon balls or some something. Next up let me guess Shaw or Hobbs will come rescue Dom using a telporting car or something. When Dom said it about legacy they should act on it pass the torch down to someone else . And let Dom actually take care of his family after saying Family for over a million times. Honestly this series should have ended with 5 or even 7 or 8 even that would be fine but now it just feels like they are dragging it out. The most senseless thing is why Dante would wait 10 freaking years before going for Dom? Was he waiting for Dom to have a child or something? I just hope they improve the story if nothing for this story.","

He was a camp, ballet-dancing, insane psychopath; which is weird, but he made it look awesome.Now onto how disappointing the movie was.It felt like they got scenes from Fast 7, 8 and 9 and put them together, there was nothing new, just the same old; we're family, over-the-top CGI and action scenes.There is one thing; I will have to watch it again when it comes out on FREE streaming because I did fall asleep repetitively and missed quite a lot. Almost every time I opened my eyes I just saw the same long, boring scenes.Next time I'll watch it with a large jug of coffee to keep me awake.","

For a 2 hour movie, it definitely felt longer to a point where we started to fast forward the movie to skip many of its boring scenes.While reading through the bad critics that Jason mamoa recieved, i cant agree. He contributed to comical lines, funny gestures and a new character which we havent seen really in the franschise. Despite his contribution, he couldnt really save it.My advise, save 2 hours and do something more beneficial than wasting it on this piece of trash. The franschise should have ended with Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift.","

"Stewart_Anthony","16 July 2023","Yep.I rolled my eyes so much throughout this film that I'm considering suing over the eye strain. No really. I don't know was worse, the ludicrous stunts, the terrible over-the-top antics of Drogo, the overall revenge plot, or the fact that the film franchise insists on keeping Bryan alive despite Paul Walker's passing, while putting so much focus on family that he's just the crappiest person in the world because he has nothing to do with his family. I mean, he's babysitting... really? ? Kids that are older than Dom's and are so far removed from this that if they stood in front of the bad guy, he wouldn't know who they were. But somehow, given the massive pull that would be for the bad guy to round up Bryan & Mia & their kids, he never will... because the franchise won't let the man pass on.But to this story... why even bother? I mean, folk have been saying to let it die for several films now. So, instead of listening, you plan a trilogy of an ending based on the slapstick antics of a bad guy getting revenge. A bad guy that had to be retconned into the film. Then you pull every ounce, scrap, meager relation that you can find for Dom (but the biggest, of course) from out of every nook & cranny then threaten & threaten & threaten.... & never deliver. The only FAMILY member that dies is the one that sacks theirself to save others...
Meanwhile you've set up the next gen sequels with more kids of kids or sisters or cousin's uncle once removed on the.... who the hell knows? And how many times (58 someone said) can you beat a person to death with the idea. I mean, hell...

Dom Toretto and his family are targeted by the vengeful son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes.The high-octane summer flick distributed by Universal Pictures was directed by Louis Leterrier. Writing credits go to Justin Lin and Dan Mazeau.THINGS I LIKED:
Just like the movie itself, the cast is stuffed. The awesome cast is packed full with fan favorites: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Charlize Theron, John Cena, Brie Larson, Scott Eastwood, Jason Momoa, and SO many more!It takes only a few minutes before the first car chase and action sequences begin. After that, it's pretty non-stop adrenaline.We get a lot of fun cameos, so no spoilers!Jason Momoa/Aquaman is hilarious and awesome as an over-the-top villain. His changing hairstyles and gold fingernail polish kept me entertained as he shined on the screen and stole every scene he was in. He looked like he was having an absolute blast making this movie.It's great to see Rita Moreno. She looks fantastic, as always.Helen Mirren! Yes! She's such a national treasure.Lots of visual and spoken humor.Almost non-stop action with entertaining and sometimes cool fight sequences.We get to travel around the world in the movie. I always love that.If you're a fan of this franchise, you'll be happy to know there WILL be a sequel.Keep watching during the final rolling credits for another scene with important information for the next Fast installment, and a fun cameo performance.The movie is delightfully self-aware, as well as completely cognizant of what the fans want. For that, audiences have awarded the film a high 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, film critics are less impressed, scoring the movie a low 54%. What did YOU think?It definitely feels like a summer blockbuster with all the epic scenes and big moments you'd expect and want.Congrats to the stunt team for their excellent work.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The movie ends abruptly without resolving everything. The film felt unfinished even though it was SO long.All of the main characters get their moment in the movie; however, not all of the characters' situations are resolved. Some characters get completely dropped after their moment and we never see them again.SPOILER: What happened to the traditional Fast and Furious with the family all eating together at a BBQ? The movie ended more like the Avengers Endgame with characters scattered all over the place.There are a lot of flashbacks that might confuse new viewers about the timeline.There are a lot of characters to keep track of. Newbies won't quite understand how everyone is connected, nor appreciate their backstories.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Profanity
Destruction
Lots of violence
People in perilous situations
Violence with weapons, as well as hand-to-hand combat
High dead-body count!","

"willz187","21 May 2023","I didnt love F9 but it had a comprehensive story possessing some plausibility. Jason Momoas character is a Heath Ledger Joker style god in this that defies logic. He's everywhere all at once, he's able to predict the future, indestructable, able to get to anybody even Cyphers goons - which in my opinion the first and most unrealistic part of the movie - and all without any money! Since it was all stolen and burned from their family in the other Fast movie this is an extension of. How did he also put a bounty on Queenie with no money? How did he know where Cypher was before attaining the Gods Eye? How is he equally a tech genuis and enforcer? And how did his mole get to be the head of Nobodys super agency? Its all so insulting. On the good side there are some welcome faces that returned and one and only one sort of good action scene. The rest of it was ludicrous, like snatching a kid from a moving car and pulling him into your speeding car. And getting a car to jump a barrier just by accelerating. And who cares about the fighting between Roman and Ludicris? These characters should be axed.","

There is too much CGI that I suppose was required if you're going to blow up a damn and detonate a nuclear device in Rome. The acting is wooden which is to be expected from Diesel, but not from Theron and others. Jason Momoa chews enough scenery to rupture a colon, vomits it back up and eats it again. Same for John Cena, although that's kind of his MO. The best character is Statham's who is on screen for maybe 5 minutes. And The Rock - who gets about 15 seconds. That ought to tell you something. Now I feel sucked in to watch the two.","

When ever i look back/rewatch the original movie, i can't help but notice that the story line was better and it wasn't packed with an excessive amount of outrageous CGI and stunts. The older movies were a better balance between the action/ story and I wish Universal take these movies back to the basics, making Fast and Furious films like they used to. Like I said, the newer ones have just been way too over the top and I feel le it's only going to get worse with the next two coming.","

"isaiahwilson15","19 May 2023","Star Wars Episode V, The Matrix, Avengers Infinity Way, Spiderman Into The Spider Verse. These are just some of movies within the world of fictional fandom that serve as tentpoles for millions and further more inspired me personally. Fast X has Nitro Boosted its way into the pantheon as it takes its place as not just the best Fast & Furious movie, but serves as a pendulum swing for the world of cinema.It starts, ends, and ultimately prospers because of FAMILY. Fast X specifically pulls the family apart yet closer together than ever before. This widely diverse group led by a half-white, half-black, yet full ""Latino"" superstar in Vin Diesel feature his Latino brother played by John Cena, his half black son Brian, and a plethora of other A-list actors & actresses (special shoutout to Missandei)!! The film somehow manages to perfectly juggle 4, even 5 plot points at a time with all 18 characters getting their proper arcs within the 2hr 20min runtime.While the franchise may have been built on family, it is defined by its cars. As Vin stated in the press lead up, this one really returns the franchise to its grounded, practical roots. Mechanics, aerodynamics, and physics are carefully kept in mind throughout the films and as an engineer, I can confirm the feasibility of every stunt. Not to mention every main character now displays expert capabilities in martial arts combat against full grown individuals in proper ballistics gear. There is a brief moment that requires a minimal suspension of belief involving an 8-year-old being able to perform donuts in a Dodge Challenger, but aside from that one moment, those who crave a return to form for visceral, practical action will not be disappointed.And just when you think the elements of family and cars are there to make for a perfect Fast & Furious movie, in typical F&F fashion they once again take it to a 12 with Jason Momoa as the primary antagonist. From the opening scene, the manic, psychopathic, yet charismatic energy can be felt every moment he is on screen. While Dante Reyes brings such a terrifying presence that actually feels like he could be the one to take this family down, Momoa takes a page from the Thanos in making an antagonist that still seems so relatable and even right at times. To then tie it all together, not since Infinity War has a movie left on such a cliffhanger that has not only made me want 2 more movies to follow, but truly makes me wish this series carries on for the next 100 years if not more. People may deny, say this review is a lie, but to quote my brother Dominic Toretto ""Ride or Die""!!!","

"dereckemt","29 June 2023","Can we just get a movie at Race Wars? What happened to the cars and racing.I get it was never about the racing but its what they loved to do initially.Is it too much to ask?Stop with the cgi stunts and all this nonsense. Bring back tokyo drift and fast 1 vibes.The cast is good enough to make an entertaining movie. But i just dont understand where these directors heads are at.Make a good action movie but call it something else for f sake.Peoples intellect are questioned when watching this stupidity they have going on now.Just give franchise fans a racing movie with some action? Simple!!!!!","

"samqsells","15 June 2023","About average for The Fast an Furious series. However, it was difficult to believe a White and Hispanic couple, Dominic and Letty had a African-American child. How did this happen? Did Letty have an affair with the milkman when Dominic was away. I wonder how many Hispanic and White child actors got passes over so Hollywood could fill their new diversity rules. Sadly, this will not get people back out to the movies.

"shishir-khan115","9 June 2023","The franchise is based on family... but every new movie is too much about family..
We becoming irritating about their family..The best thing is every charcater in this franchise is superhero.. they doesnt die.. they always come back in next film..So dont show any emotion if someone dies in the film.. it will be reveled in the next film how he escaped death..And torretto in last moment in every movie..
You always know.... what he will do.. he always will be in his car.. doing his stunt..Its like you can already write the 11th installment by your own.. its so predictable now..We wish it were like the first 4 movies.. why it became popular....","

"uthman252","6 August 2023","Saving the world by some reckless people who break the law. One of them is a technology expert, the other is a camouflage expert, another is good at mixing with others, and a person who exaggerates the importance of his relationships. It has become a stupid fashion in western movies. Bringing the dead characters in the first parts of the film series back to life has also become a habit for Western cinema. I don't know if the writer is unable to create a new character, or is he forced by the producer to bring this character back. The stories of this series of films do not fit into reality or even fantasy. I don't think it's even suitable for car enthusiasts.The same story is repeated in every part.As for the main actor, Vin Diesel, unfortunately, he is no longer good at acting. He began to play the same character during the last period of his career in all his other films.","

"sstidham-4","21 June 2023","There's no stories left, yet they're still making these.Expect Momoa to play himself again and again and isn't really acting, but that is not why you watch him in anything. His borderline homophobic scenes are to be laughable?Groot shows more emotion in his recent outing than Vin Diesel throughout this entire film (franchise).Somehow all the previous bad guys are good and even if they die we can expect them to return on the opposite side next film or so.There's suspending disbelief then there's the Fast films.This whole thing feels like an advertisement for a drone company. Cheesy shot after cheesy shot.","

"mmysttp","22 May 2023","I am a huge fan of the first couple of fast & furious movies, I have watched them multiple times and really loved many things about them. But even I hated this movie while going in with low expectations. 1) the plot is almost non-existent 2) the action is so unrealistic that it's pretty much a sci-fi movie.. the only good thing about this movie is briefly seeing the old cast and even that wears off. The Rio race vibe was good but lasted very short, it's not worth watching the movie for. Honestly absolutely freaking horrible, started looking at my watch and just wanted to get out that cinema. My rating of 4 feels generous.","

"toofancorp","27 August 2023","Major hits In the directing and editing department. Far too hyperkinetic and not in a good way. The camera NEVER lingers on anything, soooo many cuts all the time and it's awful. Pedal smash, wheels spinning, bomb rolling, Dons face, someone else's face, drone shot,...in like 5 seconds...and it goes on like this indefinitely for all the action sequences and even the talking scenes...the editing is fast and furious and it makes the movie terrible. It's borderline unwatchable which is sad because the action scenes are actually not completely ill conceived.The story is just as stupid as any Fast movie, but I don't think that's a shocker. The characters play their parts just fine for what it is.","

"creedreaper","20 May 2023","If you can trash Fast 7, 8 and 9 and just go from Fast 6 straight to Fast 10 would make this a heck of a series. I think Justin Lin exiting as the director was just what this franchise needed. This new director Louis Leterrier gave all types of Fast audience what the love. It had a good storytelling, a good balance of action vs comedy vs emotions, and aloooot less of the ridiculousness like a Pontiac in space crap. It still had over the top scenes but well balanced. And for THE LOVE OF GOD THANK YOU FOR FINALLY ADDING A STREET RACING SCENE. That's true essence of Fast movies, I wish it was bit longer. It was great seeing more new cars instead of typical Dodge charger edition. I wish more JDM and German were added, but hopefully in the next one.Jason Momoa - I was totally surprised by his character which I was completely not expecting but was really surprised by Momoa's charisma of showing his colorful feminine psychotic side instead of the normal Alpha that we all know him as. I was super invested in his character throughout because it was different, unique, and unpredictable which kept me on edge.Some characters from Fast 7, 8, and 9 are washouts and just needs to be sweep. I am really hoping to see this franchise end on a high note and with more of Momoa changing the course of this Dom's Family.Thank you for finally listening to the OG fans. Looking forward to the next!","

"SnoopyStyle","11 June 2023","This starts with the memorable vault heist chase through the streets of Rio. Dante (Jason Momoa) is the unseen son of Hernan Reyes. After his father's death, he vows revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his FAMILY.I see what Jason Momoa is doing. He's trying to create this franchise's version of The Joker and I like it. He has a solid origin story which ties directly back into the franchise's most outrageous chases in a franchise full of outrageous chases. He is the best part of this movie. On the other side, the worst part of this movie is the writing of the Rome part.I'm not sure if I should be demanding good writing from this franchise, but Rome is the inciting incident for this two movie run. It needs to be tightly written. I don't get why Dom and his cohorts are automatically outed as the villains almost immediately. There is a bomb rolling down the road and the cops are all shooting at Dom like that's going to stop it. There are all kinds of questions being ignored by the authorities and the media. The premise is problematic at best even with the eventual reveal about the new character. He doesn't control the Roman cops in that chase. I can see what Dan Mazeau and Justin Lin are trying to do. It's falling a little flat although this one has to do some heavy-lifting storywise. That's not this franchise's strong suit. I'm not even going to touch the resurrection. This franchise doesn't care and the audience should know better than to question it.","

It's taken insane and entered cosmic levels of stupidity.The random game of Rocket League in Italy somehow got topped?!. It's like a hot wheels, rocket league, avengers mash up.Vin Petrol has turned Avenger or sith lord. It's nice that while protecting his son. He kills countless of people just going about their daily commute as he destroys highways, towns, cities and a dam of in fiery explosions in the name of family. Think he'll give superman a decent run for his money given how indestructible he is.Should have stopped 5 films ago.","

"Shoaib007Rehman","10 June 2023","Hold on tight, because we're about to take a thrilling ride through the cinematic masterpiece known as ""Fast X""! Now, I must say, this film is truly a work of art... if your definition of art involves cringing, eye-rolling, and an intense desire to hit the fast-forward button.First things first, let's talk about the plot. Oh wait, there isn't one! It's like the writers played a game of Mad Libs and just filled in random car-related words to create a story. Who needs a cohesive narrative when you can have endless scenes of cars zooming aimlessly, right? I'm still trying to figure out if there was a script or if they just handed out car keys and told the actors to improvise.Now, let's discuss the characters. These masterpieces of depth and complexity are truly unforgettable. Well, maybe not in a good way. They possess the emotional range of a rock and the depth of a kiddie pool. You'll find yourself rooting for the cars more than the cardboard cutout characters attempting to deliver lines with all the charisma of a damp towel.And let's not forget the dialogue, which can only be described as a breathtaking symphony of clichés and one-liners that make you question the existence of intelligent life on Earth. It's like the writers collected every cheesy catchphrase from the last decade and crammed them into the script. If you're in dire need of cringe-inducing quotes to use as punchlines at parties, this film has got you covered.But the real star of the show, of course, is the mind-numbingly excessive action. It's like they took the laws of physics, threw them out the window, and laughed maniacally as cars flew through the air like superhero acrobats. The stunts are so outlandish and ridiculous that you'll find yourself questioning the very fabric of reality. I mean, who needs logic when you can have cars defying gravity and defying all reason?","

"Motion-Picture-Watchmen","10 June 2023","The concept of a franchising, which is not as fresh phenomenon, took different turns with the success of the MCU.But while the implicit deal between moviemakers and filmgoers, that is that the franchises are financially lucrative and narratively captivating, might have worked earlier, it does not anymore. Not at all.The narrative is dead. In this case, it was replaced by a futile soap drama, where the extensive net of characters is convoluted and the viewers emotional engagement of the story is zero. One of my friends fell asleep in the cinema. The cliffhanger handing is also frustrating.The action does not feel as exciting, because not only is there too much, but also too much too fast. Furthermore, the CGI has taken all kind of thrills of it. It has become completely unrealistic.Jason Mamoa is as random of a villain as he is lackluster and forgettable.The rest of the cast is also mediocre.While F9 was a parody, Fast X is a parody of the parody. In sum, that gives a cinematic catastrophy that was a waste of money.",NA
"Carajillo-43","28 June 2023","This movie is terrible. As other reviewers have mentioned, it's a mishmash mess of previous movies. I've seen all of the movies (except Hobbs and Shaw) but because the series now spans 22 years, I can't keep track of who all the characters are especially because they keep bringing back characters who previously died. I had to search online and read a character review to remember what these characters did and what movie they were in to try to understand why we are still seeing them. I was waiting for Owen Shaw to return because it seems like they are bringing back any and every character from the previous movies. And then all through the media we were told that The Rock (Hobbs) had beef with Vin Diesel so that's why he wasn't in Fast 9 or Fast X. But guess what, now he's back in Fast 11 or whatever it's going to be called. So I guess everything is fine now between them?I like Jason Momoa but his character was painful and annoying to watch. Why was he playing tea party with dead bodies? That scene was so cringey.I don't even understand why we had Tess in this movie. She was so bland and didn't fit in anywhere. And why is Cipher back? I don't understand her plan. Letty was so unforgettable in this movie I literally forgot she was even in it until she's suddenly snowshoeing through the arctic with Cipher and they happen upon the not really dead Gisele popping out of a submarine. I mean what?I miss the days where this franchise was about racing cars and showing off fancy drifting. Now it's all unbelievable super human stuff. Sure, Vin Diesel can lift a car one handed after bending rebar also with his bare hands. Of course he can manage to keep his car on the road despite two helicopters being attached with harpoon anchors and rope pulling it upwards. And why can't he drive his car over several bridges but not crash or even pop a tire or bend a wheel and escape all the flames following him?Will I continue to watch? Probably. Because once I start something I like to see it through but I really hope they stop making these soon. I mean I started watching these movies when I was 21 years old. Now I'm middle aged. I hope I'm not still watching when I'm in retirement because this franchise definitely needs to be retired.",NA
"CinemaSerf","22 May 2023","Starting off with a bit of nostalgia, this high-octane adventure sees just how ""Dom"" (Vin Diesel) et al become the targets of ""Dante"" (Jason Momoa). The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the ""family"" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from ""Cipher"" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of ""Tej"" (Ludacris) and ""Roman"" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough. If you don't know what you are going to get from the series by now, then you ought not to bother.",NA
