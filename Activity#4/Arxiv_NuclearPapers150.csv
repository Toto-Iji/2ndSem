"1","Accessing the speed of sound in relativistic ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions using the mean transverse momentum","Fernando G. Gardim, Andre V. Giannini, Jean-Yves Ollitrault","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","It has been argued that the speed of sound of the strong interaction at high temperature can be measured using the variation of the mean transverse momentum with the particle multiplicity in ultracentral heavy-ion collisions. We test this correspondence by running hydrodynamic simulations at zero impact parameter with several equations of state, at several colliding energies from 0.2 TeV to 15 TeV per nucleon pair. The correspondence is found to be precise and robust for a smooth, boost-invariant fluid and an ideal detector. We discuss the differences between this ideal setup and an actual experiment. We conclude that the extraction of the speed of sound from data is reliable, and that the main uncertainty comes from our poor knowledge of the distribution of density fluctuations at the early stages of the collision.","Sun, 10 Mar 2024 00:44:19 UTC (381 KB)"
"2","Shear viscosity of quark-gluon plasma at finite temperature and chemical potential and QCD phase transitions","Wei-be He, Guo-yun Shao, Chong-long Xie, Ren-xin Xu","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)","We explore the shear viscosity of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in the full QCD phase diagram within the framework of kinetic theory with the relaxation time approximation based on the $2 \leftrightarrow 2$ elastic scatterings of quark quasiparticles. The temperature and chemical potential dependent masses of particles, including $u, d, s$ quarks, their antiparticles, and exchanged mesons, are calculated in the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona Lasinio (PNJL) model. The results indicate that, at small chemical potential, the value of $\eta/s$ has a minimum near the Mott dissociation of mesons and increases rapidly in the lower-temperature side of the chiral crossover phase transition. At large chemical potential (high density), $\eta/s$ in the QGP phase is dominated by the temperature, and the value of $\eta/s$ is greatly enhanced at lower temperature. At intermediate temperature and chemical potential near the QCD phase transition, the situation is relatively complicated. The behavior of $\eta/s$ is influenced by the competition between temperature, density effect, and QCD phase transition.","Sat, 9 Mar 2024 15:55:53 UTC (638 KB)"
"3","Skewed generalized parton distributions of proton from basis light-front quantization","Yiping Liu, Siqi Xu, Chandan Mondal, Xingbo Zhao, James P.Vary","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)","We obtain all the leading-twist quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs) inside the proton at nonzero skewness within the basis light-front quantization framework. We employ the light-front wave functions of the proton from a light-front quantized Hamiltonian in the valence Fock sector consisting of a three-dimensional confinement potential and a one-gluon exchange interaction with fixed coupling. We find that the qualitative behaviors of our GPDs are similar to those of other theoretical calculations. We further examine the GPDs within the boost-invariant longitudinal coordinate, $\sigma=\frac{1}{2} b^- P^+$, which is identified as the Fourier conjugate of the skewness. The GPDs in the $\sigma$-space show diffraction patterns, which are akin to the diffractive scattering of a wave in optics.","Sat, 9 Mar 2024 14:13:06 UTC (8,670 KB)"
"4","Neutron scattering off spherical nuclei with global nonlocal dispersive optical model","B. Morillon, G. Blanchon, P. Romain, H.F. Arellano","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","We present a global nonlocal and dispersive optical model potential for neutron scattering off spherical nuclei with incident energies up to 250 MeV. This optical model is an extension of the non-dispersive Perey-Buck potential. The imaginary components are chosen energy-dependent and the dispersive constraints are taken into account. The surface imaginary part is nonlocal, whereas the volume imaginary part above 10 MeV is local, allowing to reproduce total cross sections and scattering data for high energies. We obtain a good description of scattering observables for target-nuclei ranging from $A=16$, up to $209$. The inclusion of nonlocal spin-orbit term enables a better description of the analyzing power data relative to the local dispersive model.","Sat, 9 Mar 2024 08:55:39 UTC (722 KB)"
"5","Description of moment of inertia and the interplay between anti-pairing and pairing correlations in even-even $^{244}$Pu and $^{248}$Cm","Anshul Dadwal, Xiao-Tao He","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","Within the supersymmetry scheme, which includes many-body interactions and a perturbation possessing the SO(5) (or SU(5)) symmetry, the rotational bands of the $A\sim 250$ mass region are studied systematically. A novel modification is introduced, extending the Arima coefficient to the third order. This study is dedicated to the quantitative analysis of evolving trends in intraband $\gamma$-transition energy, kinematic, and the dynamic moment of inertia within the rotational bands of $^{244}$Pu and $^{248}$Cm. The computed outcomes exhibit an exceptional degree of agreement with experimental observations across various conditions. The significance of including a higher-order Arima coefficient is further examined by contrasting it with the previously suggested model. The calculated results demonstrate the significance of both the anti-pairing and pairing effects in the evolution of the dynamic moment of inertia. Additionally, these insights reveal the importance of a newly introduced parameter in accurately depicting complex nuclear behaviors such as back-bending, up-bending, and the downturn in the moment of inertia.","Sat, 9 Mar 2024 07:20:01 UTC (1,517 KB)"

In this study, we emphatically investigate the simultaneous presence of dark matter and $\nu$NP revealing a response resembling of Standard Model neutrino backgrounds in Xenon-based dark matter experiments. Demonstrated by three U(1) extension models, we figure out that dark matter signals can be distinguished from an excess or a depletion of neutrino contributions from $\nu$NP by a statistically defined distinction method in nuclear and electronic recoil spectra. We also present the influence of $\nu$NP on the exclusion limits for spin-independent dark matter-nucleon interactions. Our work might pave the way for new physics discrimination in future dark matter experiments.","Sat, 9 Mar 2024 06:59:20 UTC (1,609 KB)"

The four-particle symmetric cumulant $sc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$, three-particle asymmetric cumulant $ac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$, and the normalised cumulants $nsc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $nac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$ from the transverse momentum conservation and flow are calculated. The interplay between the two effects is also investigated.

"8","Muon Capture on $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O from $Ab~Initio$ Nuclear Theory","Lotta Jokiniemi, Petr Navratil, Jenni Kotila, Kostas Kravvaris","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","Muon capture on nuclei is one of the most promising probes of the nuclear electroweak current driving the yet-hypothetical neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Both processes involve vector and axial-vector currents at finite momentum transfer, $q\sim 100$ MeV, as well as the induced pseudoscalar and weak-magnetism currents. Comparing measured muon-capture rates with reliable $ab~initio$ nuclear-theory predictions could help us validate these currents. To this end, we compute partial muon-capture rates for $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O, feeding the ground and excited states in $^{6}$He, $^{12}$B and $^{16}$N, using $ab~initio$ no-core shell model with two- and three-nucleon chiral interactions. We remove the spurious center-of-mass motion by introducing translationally invariant operators and approximate the effect of hadronic two-body currents by Fermi-gas model. We solve the bound-muon wave function from the Dirac wave equations in the Coulomb field created by a finite nucleus. We find that the computed rates to the low-lying states in the final nuclei are in good agreement with the measured counterparts. We highlight sensitivity of some of the transitions to the sub-leading three-nucleon interaction terms. We also compare summed rates to several tens of final states with the measured total capture rates and note that we slightly underestimate the total rate with this simple approach due to limited range of excitation energies.","Sat, 9 Mar 2024 03:19:36 UTC (1,749 KB)"
"9","Testing effective field theory with the most general neutron decay correlations","Chien-Yeah Seng","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)","Built on the seminal works by Jackson-Treiman-Wyld and Ebel-Feldman, we derive the most general free neutron differential decay rate where all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) are polarized. This introduces 33 new correlations in addition to the 18 existing ones, which over-constrain the coupling constants in the low-energy effective field theory of charged weak interactions, and thus provides stringent tests of the validity of the theory framework itself. We classify the correlation coefficients in terms of their Standard Model limit and discrete symmetries, and study their expansion with respect to the new physics coupling strengths, supplemented by the experiment-independent $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ virtual electromagnetic radiative corrections.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 23:00:25 UTC (21 KB)"

Karuza, D. Horns, A. Gougas, S. Cetin, G. Cantatore, D. Budker","High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)","Anti-quark nuggets (AQNs) have been suggested to solve the dark matter (DM) and the missing antimatter problem in the universe and have been proposed as an explanation of various observations. Their size is in the {\mu}m range and their density is about equal to the nuclear density with an expected flux of about $0.4 / km^2 / year$. For the typical velocity of DM constituents ($\sim$250 km/s), the solar system bodies act as highly performing gravitational lenses. Here we assume that DM streams or clusters are impinging, e.g., on the Earth, as it was worked out for DM axions and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Interestingly, in the LHC beam, unforeseen beam losses are triggered by so-called Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs), which are believed to be constituted of dust particles with a size in the {\mu}m range and a density of several orders of magnitude lower than AQNs. Prezeau suggested that streaming DM constituents incident on the Earth should result in jet-like structures (""hairs"") exiting the Earth, or a kind of caustics. Such ideas open novel directions in the search for DM. This work suggests a new analysis of the UFO results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), assuming that they are eventually, at least partly, due to AQNs. Firstly, a reanalysis of the existing data from the 4000 beam monitors since the beginning of the LHC is proposed, arguing that dust and AQNs should behave differently. The feasibility of this idea has been discussed with CERN accelerator people and potential collaborators.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 10:21:36 UTC (263 KB)"

Entem","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","We study a family of separable potentials with and without added contact interactions by solving the associated Lippmann-Schwinger equation with two coupled partial waves. The matching of the resulting amplitude matrix with the effective-range expansion is studied in detail. When a counterterm is included in the potential we also carefully discuss its renormalization. Next, we use the matrix $N/D$ method and study whether the amplitude matrices from the potentials considered admit an $N/D$ representation in matrix form. As a novel result we show that it is typically not possible to find such matrix representation for the coupled partial-wave case. However, a separate $N/D$ representation for each coupled partial wave, a valid option known in the literature, is explicitly implemented and numerically solved in cases where the matrix $N/D$ method is unavailable.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 17:52:58 UTC (466 KB)"

In order to showcase the capability of the proposed QT approach, we simulate the nuclear wavepacket dynamics and ultrafast electron diffraction of photoexcited pyrrole molecules using ab initio quantum chemical CASSCF method. From simulated time-resolved diffraction data, we retrieve the evolving density matrix in a crude diabatic representation basis and reveal the symmetry of the excited pyrrole wavepacket. Our QT approach opens the route to make quantum version of ""molecular movie"" that covers the electronic degree of freedom, and equips ultrafast electron diffraction with the power to reveal the coherence between electronic states, relaxation and dynamics of population transfer.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 13:54:39 UTC (6,468 KB)"

Following this idea, we reconstructed the intrinsic shape of 12C using experimental electron scattering data with minimal theoretical assumption. Our sole assumption was that the observed 0+, 2+, 3-, and 4+ states share a common internal structure, forming a rotational spectrum. The reconstructed intrinsic density showed a beautiful triangular shape with three peaks implying alpha cluster formation in the ground band.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 13:12:07 UTC (5,808 KB)"

The collision term of the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation in presence of background magnetic field is solved using the relaxation time approximation. The medium modified relaxation time is obtained from the corresponding in-medium $\pi\pi\rightarrow \pi\pi$ scattering cross-section calculated using the thermo-magnetic $\rho$ propagator. It is observed that the average relaxation time shows a $1/T^4$ variation with temperature for a fixed value of magnetic field. The relaxation time shows a mild oscillatory variation with respect to the magnetic field. It is also observed that the medium dependent scattering cross-section causes a considerable amount of influence on the electrical conductivity and shear viscosity compared to its vacuum counterpart.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 09:09:23 UTC (120 KB)"

A truncation scheme of the Israel-Stewart formalism derived in our earlier work is proposed that extends the minimal causal formulation. It consists of altogether 40 interconnected relaxation-type dynamical equations -- 16 (24) of them correspond to the independent components of the energy-momentum (spin) tensor. Similarly to previous studies, we find that the stability of the perturbations depends on the form of the spin equation of state. The stability is achieved if the equation of state satisfies the generalized Frenkel condition demanding that the ""electric"" and ""magnetic"" components of the spin density tensor have opposite signs. We then re-examine the study of the first-order (Navier-Stokes) dissipative spin hydrodynamics and find a similar type of behavior, which is consistent with the overall stability of low-momentum rest frame modes in conventional relativistic hydrodynamics.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 18:07:28 UTC (68 KB)"

They require the knowledge of correlators of fields in the target beyond those computed in the standard McLerran-Venugopalan model, specifically those between transverse and boost-enhanced components, and of the recoil of the fields. We neglect the latter, while for the former we develop a linear model valid for large nuclei. We considered the unpolarized cross sections for dijet production in the approximation of a homogenous dilute nucleus, obtaining simple analytic expressions for the cross sections at nex-to-eikonal accuracy, valid in the limit of total dijet momentum and dijet momentum imbalance larger than the saturation scale of the nucleus. We perform a numerical study of the results at energies of the Electron Ion Collider, finding $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ effects in the cross sections at large total momentum. We also analyze the azimuthal asymmetries between total momentum and imbalance, finding that non-eikonal corrections induce odd azimuthal harmonics for the situation of jets with equal momentum fractions from the virtual photon, where they are absent in the eikonal approximation. Finally, in the eikonal approximation we have compared the results of our analytic expansion valid in the dilute limit of the target, and the full Color Glass Condensate results in the McLerran-Venugopalan model and their correlation limit. Our analytic expressions match the correlation limit ones in the region where both should be simultaneously valid and reproduce very well the full Color Glass Condensate results in its validity region.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 15:53:23 UTC (1,430 KB)"

We identify two features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, many molecular species are intrinsically rotation-spin entangled in a way that cannot be broken without transitioning to another species or breaking symmetry. Second, each molecular position state houses an internal pseudo-spin or ""fiber"" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates.

This quantity has been explored in the simplified parametrization of NpNn as well as the multiplication NpNnI of this product with the isospin asymmetry I. The calculations for Pc are both performed in microscopic and model-dependent way. Within the microscopic approach, based on our previous work [Chin. Phys.

While Ac greater than 28, Pc is obtained through the charge-number dependence of Pc on the decay products proposed by Ren et al. [Phys. Rev. C 70,034304 (2004)]. In the model-dependent approach, Pc is extracted through the ratios from calculated cluster radioactivity half-lives in the framework of unified fission model (UFM) proposed by Dong et al. [Eur.

"25","Medium Assisted Low Energy Nuclear Fusion","Pankaj Jain, Harishyam Kumar","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","We study the process of nuclear fusion at low energies in a medium using the second order time dependent perturbation theory. We consider a specific process which involves fusion of a low energy proton with a Nickel nucleus. The reaction proceeds in two steps or interactions. We refer to the amplitudes corresponding to these two interactions as the the molecular and the nuclear matrix elements. The first amplitude involves Coulomb interaction with another nucleus in the medium while the second corresponds to the nuclear fusion process. It has been shown in earlier papers that such a second order process has negligible amplitude unless it is assisted by special medium effects. In the present paper we show the presence of a special configuration of atoms which greatly enhances the process. We find that if the spacings among the atoms can be tuned, the rate can be sufficiently enhanced so that easily observable. The spacings do not require acute fine tuning, however, if they are significantly off the rate falls sharply to negligible values. This might also explain both the successes and failures experienced by many experimentalists studying this phenomenon. We study only a particular final state which involves emission of one photon. However we show that many final states are possible which need not involve photon emission.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 11:57:41 UTC (36 KB)"

The spectroscopy-based method relies on identifying two specific delayed $\gamma$ lines (at 124.6 and 172.5 keV), which can be analyzed via single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In this work, we present a proof-of-principle study to investigate proton activation in a commercial iodinated contrast media (ICM) for radiology. Five measurements were conducted at different proton energies (6-10 MeV), equivalent to the last millimeters of clinical proton range. Activation in the ICM was measured with four LaBr$_3$(Ce) scintillators. The contribution from iodine was separated from the activation of the solvent, yielding excellent agreement with previously reported data. These results demonstrate the potential of this technique and pave the way for further testing in clinically relevant scenarios.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 11:27:19 UTC (776 KB)"

Using the modified AMPT model, we simulate three $\alpha$ + core configurations of $^{44}$Ti in $^{44}$Ti+$^{44}$Ti collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV as well as other systems with Woods-Saxon structures. One of these configurations has no additional constraint, but the other two have the Mott density edge $r_{\mathrm{Mott}}$ set as either a lower or upper bound on the cluster position $r_{\alpha}$ to check the influence of $\alpha$ dissolution. This is the first time that the initial stage of the geometric properties in heavy-ion collisions has been configured using the traditional treatment of the nuclear structure. We compare the radial nucleon density, multiplicity distribution, transverse momentum spectra, eccentricity, triangularity, elliptic flow and triangular flow of these six systems. $\alpha$ + core structures can alter all these observations especially in the most-central collisions, among which elliptic flow is the most hopeful as a probe of such structures.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 09:44:26 UTC (96 KB)"

For the highest of the studied energies, the spots are scattered so sparsely, that it is not possible to link spots belonging to one track. The intensity (brightness) of the fluorescent tracks increases with the increasing LET and agrees well with the trend established earlier for various heavier ions.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 08:36:18 UTC (457 KB)"

The sPOD tries to approximate transport-dominated flows by a sum of co-moving data fields. The proposed methods stem from sPOD but optimize the co-moving fields directly and penalize their nuclear norm to promote low rank of the individual data in the decomposition. Furthermore, we add a robustness term to the decomposition that can deal with interpolation error and data noises. Leveraging tools from convex optimization, we derive three proximal algorithms to solve the decomposition problem. We report a numerical comparison with existing methods against synthetic data benchmarks and then show the separation ability of our methods on 1D and 2D incompressible and reactive flows. The resulting methodology is the basis of a new analysis paradigm that results in the same interpretability as the POD for the individual co-moving fields.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 08:32:07 UTC (1,103 KB)"

While a compound nucleus has been understood in terms of statistical mechanics, its description based on a many-body Hamiltonian has yet to be developed. Here we present a microscopic modeling of a compound nucleus starting from a nucleonic degree of freedom. We focus in particular on a decay of a heavy compound nucleus, that is, fission and radiative capture. To this end, we develop an approach based on a non-equilibrium Green's function, which is combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach based on a constrained density-functional theory (DFT). We apply this approach to a barrier-top fission of $^{236}$U, restricting the model space to seniority zero configurations of neutrons and protons. Our calculation with a Skyrme energy functional yields the fission-to-capture branching ratio of around 0.07. While this value is still reasonable, the calculation underestimates the branching ratio by about a factor of 40 as compared to the empirical value, indicating a necessity of seniority non-zero configurations in the model space. We also find that the distribution of the fission probability approximately follows the chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom of the order of 1, which is consistent with the experimental finding.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 06:37:12 UTC (42 KB)[v2] Fri, 8 Mar 2024 04:01:15 UTC (42 KB)"

Based on this result, we propose a simple analytic formula for estimating the spectroscopic factor of proton radioactivity. With the help of this formula, the calculated half-lives of proton radioactivity can reproduce the experimental data successfully within a factor of 2.77. Furthermore, we extend the D-TPA with this formula for evaluating the spectroscopic factor to predict the proton radioactivity half-lives of 12 proton radioactivity candidates whose radioactivity is energetically allowed or observed but not yet quantified in NUBASE2020.

We show that the dissipative dynamics of the boosted fluctuating fluid can be simulated by making random transfers of charge between fluid cells, interspersed with ideal hydrodynamic time steps. The random charge transfers are accepted or rejected in a Metropolis step using the entropy as a statistical weight. This procedure reproduces the expected strains of dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics in a specific (and non-covariant) hydrodynamic frame known as the density frame. Numerical results, both with and without noise, are presented and compared to relativistic kinetics and analytical expectations. An all order resummation of the density frame gradient expansion reproduces the covariant dynamics in a specific model. In contrast to all other numerical approaches to relativistic dissipative fluids, the dissipative fluid formalism presented here is strictly first order in gradients and has no non-hydrodynamic modes. The physical naturalness and simplicity of the Metropolis algorithm, together with its convergence properties, make it a promising tool for simulating stochastic relativistic fluids in heavy ion collisions and for critical phenomena in the relativistic domain.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 03:35:01 UTC (1,311 KB)"

However, in that work, the authors only considered the constraints on the EoS from nuclear experiments/theories and the gravitational wave data of GW170817; the possible phase transition has not been taken into account. In this work, we adopt three EoS models (including the one incorporates a first-order strong phase transition) that are constrained by the latest multimessenger NS data, including in particular the recent mass\textendash radius measurements of two NSs by Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer, to update the estimation of the gravitational masses of RBS 1223, RX J0720.4-3125, and RX J1856.5-3754.

All the inferred gravitational masses are within the range of the NS masses measured in other ways. We have also calculated the radius, tidal-deformability, and moment of inertia of these sources. The inclusion of the first-order strong phase transition has little influence on modifying the results.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 20:09:04 UTC (162 KB)[v2] Fri, 8 Mar 2024 12:51:43 UTC (162 KB)"

In this work we examine the effects of combining multiple RSF detections on these symmetry energy constraints, and consider how realistic uncertainties in the masses of the progenitor NSs may weaken them. We show that the detection of subsequent multimessenger events has the potential to substantially improve constraints beyond those obtained from the first, and that this improvement is insensitive to the mass of the NSs which produce the RSFs and its uncertainty. This sets these asteroseismic constraints apart from bulk NS properties such as radius, for which the NS mass is highly important, meaning that any multimessenger RSF and GW events can equally improve our knowledge of fundamental physics.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 15:50:35 UTC (1,686 KB)"

In the framework of a constituent quark model which satisfactorily describes a wide range of properties of conventional hadrons containing heavy quarks, the quark-antiquark and meson-meson degrees of freedom have been incorporated with the goal of elucidating the influence of open-bottom meson-meson thresholds into the $\Upsilon$ states whose masses are within the energy range of the $\Upsilon(10753)$'s mass. It is well known that such effects could be relevant enough as to generate dynamically new states and thus provide a plausible explanation of the nature of the $\Upsilon(10753)$ state. In particular, we have performed a coupled-channels calculation in which the bare states $\Upsilon(4S)$, $\Upsilon(3D)$, $\Upsilon(5S)$ and $\Upsilon(4D)$ are considered together with the threshold channels $B\bar{B}$, $B\bar{B}^\ast$, $B^\ast \bar{B}^\ast$, $B_s\bar{B}_s$, $B_s\bar{B}_s^\ast$ and $B_s^\ast \bar{B}_s^\ast$. Among the results we have described, the following conclusions are of particular interest: (i) a richer complex spectrum is gained when thresholds are present and bare bound states are sufficiently non-relativistic; (ii) those poles obtained in the complex energy plane do not have to appear as simple peaks in the relevant cross sections; and (iii) the $\Upsilon(10750)$ candidate is interpreted as a dressed hadronic resonance whose structure is an equally mixture of a conventional $b\bar b$ state and $B^\ast \bar B^\ast$ molecule.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 15:04:41 UTC (88 KB)"

This network is also coupled with temperature, making it extremely robust and, together with its size, unique of its kind. The inclusion of electron captures on free protons makes the network very appropriate for multidimensional studies of Type Ia supernova explosions, especially when the exploding object is a massive white dwarf. The results obtained with the proposed medium-sized network compare fairly well, to a few percent, with those computed with the extended network WinNet (> 2000 isotopes) in scenarios reproducing the gross physical conditions of current Type Ia supernova explosion models. In those cases where the carbon and oxygen fuel ignites at high density, the high-temperature plateau typical of the nuclear statistical equilibrium regime is well defined and stable, allowing large integration time steps. We show that the inclusion of electron captures on free protons substantially improves the estimation of the electron fraction of the mixture. Therefore, the pressure is better determined than in networks where electron captures are excluded, which will ultimately lead to more reliable hydrodynamic models. Explosive combustion of helium at low density, occurring near the surface layer of a white dwarf, is also better described with the proposed network, which gives nuclear energy generation rates much closer to WinNet than typical reduced alpha networks.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 14:33:51 UTC (6,386 KB)"

Then the effects of nuclear magnetism on halo phenomenon are explored by taking the experimentally suggested deformed halo nucleus $^{31}$Ne as an example. For $^{31}$Ne, nuclear magnetism contributes 0.09 MeV to total binding energy, and the breaking of Kramers degeneracy results in 0-0.2 MeV splitting in canonical single-particle spectra. The blocked neutron level has a dominant component of $p$ wave and it is marginally bound. However, if we ignore nuclear magnetism, the level becomes unbound. This shows a subtle mechanism that nuclear magnetism changes the single-particle energies, causing a nucleus to become bound. Based on the TODRHBc results, a prolate one-neutron halo is formed around the near-spherical core in $^{31}$Ne. The nucleon current is mostly contributed by the halo rather than the core, except near the center of the nucleus.

They are also small if the multiplicity distribution of charged particles per wounded nucleon is close to the Poissonian limit, which is the case at low energy nuclear collisions, e.g., at GSI/SIS18. We further find that mixed events are not necessarily needed to extract the correction for volume fluctuations, albeit it can help if event statistics is small, which is typically the case for reconstructing the higher-order cumulants.

Following ATLAS Analysis Preservation policies, many analyses have been preserved as containerised Yadage workflows, and after validation were added to a curated selection for the pMSSM study. To run the workflows at scale, we utilised the REANA reusable analysis platform. We describe how the REANA platform was enhanced to ensure the best concurrent throughput by internal service scheduling changes. We discuss the scalability of the approach on Kubernetes clusters from 500 to 5000 cores. Finally, we demonstrate a possibility of using additional ad-hoc public cloud infrastructure resources by running the same workflows on the Google Cloud Platform.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 06:40:06 UTC (2,066 KB)"

According to the predictions of general relativity and state-of-the-art nuclear equations of state, this object is too heavy to be a neutron star.~In this work, we explore the possibility that this object is a neutron star under the hypothesis that general relativity is modified to include screening mechanisms, and that the neutron star formed in an unscreened environment. We introduce a set of parameterized-post-Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (post-TOV) equations appropriate for screened modified gravity whose free parameters are environment-dependent. We find that it is possible that the GW190814 secondary could be a neutron star that formed in an unscreened environment for a range of reasonable post-TOV parameters.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 01:46:25 UTC (176 KB)"

In order to examine hexadecapole correlations, we employ a mapped $sdg$ interacting boson model, with parameters derived from a self-consistent mean-field calculations with a relativistic energy density functional. We apply this model to even-even isotopes of Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy and Er ($Z=60 - 68$) with the neutron number $N=84-96$. The obtained results show a good agreement with the experiment. By comparing the results with the ones obtained from a simpler mapped $sd$ interacting boson model, we show that the inclusion of hexadecapole, $g$ boson is necessary to improve the results of the $J^{\pi} \geq 6^{+}$ yrast energies in the nuclei with $N=84$ and 86, being near the neutron shell closure. The $sdg$ interacting boson model increases the quadrupole transition strengths between yrast states in the $N=90$ and 92 well deformed nuclei, which is in good agreement with the experiment for most of those isotopes. The presence of $g$ bosons does have an important effect on hexadecapole transition strengths, although experimental data for such transitions are limited. The obtained monopole transition strengths do not differ significantly from the ones obtained from the simpler $sd$ model.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 01:04:03 UTC (3,014 KB)"

Most current models of the tidal response of relativistic stars either assume a static response model, or use phenomenological models inspired by Newtonian gravity. In this work, we present a general formalism for computing the linear dynamical tidal response function of relativistic, spherically symmetric stars. Our formalism incorporates stratification due to thermal and chemical imbalances, allowing one to study the effects of g modes on the tidal response function. We also describe how to incorporate sources of dissipation due to shear and bulk viscosity. To showcase the utility of our approach, we present several applications for polytropic stars in general relativity. We show how our formalism can capture the dynamical tidal resonance due to the f and g modes of inviscid stars and explore the sensitivity of the dynamical tidal response to the compactness of the star. We also compute the dissipative tidal deformability due to bulk and shear viscous dissipation. We find that, for the same viscous profile, the shear viscous tidal lag parameter is 100-1000 times larger than the dimensionless bulk viscous tidal lag parameter.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 19:00:05 UTC (853 KB)[v2] Fri, 8 Mar 2024 16:14:55 UTC (842 KB)"

C and N also have distinct nucleosynthetic origins and serve as diagnostics of mixing and mass loss. We use subgiants to find strong trends in the birth [C/N] with [Fe/H], which differ between the low-$\alpha$ and high-$\alpha$ populations. We demonstrate that these birth trends have a strong impact on the surface abundances after the FDU. This effect is neglected in current stellar models, which use solar-scaled C and N. We map out the FDU as a function of evolutionary state, mass, and composition using a large and precisely measured asteroseismic dataset in first-ascent red giant branch (RGB) and core He-burning, or red clump (RC), stars. We describe the domains where [C/N] is a useful mass diagnostic and find that the RC complements the RGB and extends the range of validity to higher mass. We find evidence for extra mixing on the RGB below [Fe/H]= -0.4, matching literature results, for high-$\alpha$ giants, but there is no clear evidence of mixing in the low-$\alpha$ giants.

The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by BNS merger remnants, in particular, have the potential of setting tight constraints on the neutron-star equation of state (EOS) that would complement those coming from the late inspiral, direct mass-radius measurements, or ab-initio dense-matter calculations. To explore this possibility, we perform a representative series of general-relativistic simulations of BNS systems with EOSs carefully constructed so as to cover comprehensively the high-density regime of the EOS space. From these simulations, we identify a novel and tight correlation between the ratio of the energy and angular-momentum losses in the late-time portion of the post-merger signal, i.e., the ""long ringdown"", and the properties of the EOS at the highest pressures and densities in neutron-star cores. When applying this correlation to post-merger GW signals, we find a significant reduction of the EOS uncertainty at densities several times the nuclear saturation density, where no direct constraints are currently available. Hence, the long ringdown has the potential of providing new and stringent constraints on the state of matter in neutron stars in general and, in particular, in their cores.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 19:00:01 UTC (4,735 KB)"

Recent advancements have unveiled the heterogeneous distribution of TF molecules in the nucleus, posing challenges to the precise decoding of concentration signals. To explore this phenomenon, we employ high-resolution single-cell imaging of a fluorescently tagged TF protein, Bicoid, in living fly embryos. We show that accumulation of Bicoid in submicron clusters preserves the spatial information of the maternal Bicoid gradient, and that cluster intensity, size, and frequency offer remarkably precise spatial cues. We further discover that various known gene targets of Bicoid activation colocalize with clusters and that for the target gene Hunchback, this colocalization is dependent on its enhancer binding affinity. Modeling information transfer through these clusters suggests that clustering offers a more rapid sensing mechanism for global nuclear concentrations than freely diffusing TF molecules detected by simple enhancers.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 13:13:57 UTC (4,915 KB)"

As cavities, in particular plasmonic nanocavities, are lossy and the lifetime of their modes can be very short, their lossy nature must be incorporated into the calculations. The Lindblad master equation is commonly considered as an appropriate tool to describe this lossy nature. This approach requires the dynamics of the density operator and is thus substantially more costly than approaches employing the SchrÃ¶dinger equation for the quantum wave function when several or many nuclear degrees of freedom are involved. In this work we compare numerically the Lindblad and SchrÃ¶dinger descriptions discussed in the literature for a molecular example where the cavity is pumped by a laser. The laser and cavity properties are varied over a range of parameters. It is found that the SchrÃ¶dinger description adequately describes the dynamics of the polaritons and emission signal as long as the laser intensity is moderate and the pump time is not much longer than the lifetime of the cavity mode. Otherwise, it is demonstrated that the SchrÃ¶dinger description gradually fails. The results are discussed and analyzed.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 11:51:00 UTC (7,660 KB)"

Some questions which were impossible to answer heretofore -- can be addressed nowadays by using inverse kinematics. These includes the structure of short-lived nuclei and the precision study of exclusive channels with production of residual nuclei in certain quantum states. Theoretical understanding such processes is so far based on factorization models which combine the single-step amplitude of the reaction on a bound nucleon or nuclear cluster with a certain wave function of its relative motion with respect to the residual nucleus. The nuclear structure information is encoded in the spectroscopic amplitude, calculable within nuclear many-body theories.

The directed flows of various particles provide information on dynamics in various parts and at various stages of the colliding system depending on the particle. However, the information on the equation of state is not always directly accessible because of strong influence of the afterburner stage or insufficient equilibration of the matter. It is found that the crossover scenario gives the best overall description of the data. This crossover EoS is soft in the hadronic phase. The transition into QGP in Au+Au collisions occurs at collision energies between 3 and 4.5 GeV, at baryon densities $n_B \geq 4 n_0$ and temperatures $\approx 150$ MeV.

A simultaneous fit is performed with the Blast-Wave (BW) model to the transverse momentum ({\ppt}) spectra of identified hadrons together with light (anti-)nuclei produced in {\auau} collisions at {\sqrtsNN} = 7.7 -- 200 GeV and in {\pbpb} collisions at {\sqrtsNN} = 2.76. The energy and centrality dependence of kinetic freeze-out temperature ($T_{kin}$) and collective flow velocity $\langle \beta \rangle$ has been studied. It is observed that light (anti-)nuclei also participate in the collective expansion of the medium created in the collision when included in a common fit with the light hadrons. We observe a marginal rise in the $T_{kin}$ and a slight decrease in $\langle \beta \rangle$ when compared to the values obtained from the fit to light hadrons, indicating that heavier particles decouple earlier in time from the fireball compared to the light hadrons due to higher masses and are more sensitive to the effects of the radial flow. A similar $\langle \beta \rangle$ and significant larger $T_{kin}$ is observed when fit is performed to only protons and light (anti-)nuclei. Additionally, we also observe that the $T_{kin}$ increases from central to peripheral collisions, which is consistent with the argument of short-lived fireball in peripheral collisions. Whereas the $\langle \beta \rangle$ shows a decreasing trend from central to peripheral collisions indicating a more rapid expansion in the central collisions. Both, $T_{kin}$ and $\langle \beta \rangle$ show a weak dependence on the collision energy at most energies. We also observe a strong anti-correlation between $T_{kin}$ and $\langle \beta \rangle$.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 08:28:42 UTC (200 KB)"

It is to be noted that the R3Y NN potential can be expressed in terms of masses of the mesons and their couplings by considering the meson degrees of freedom within the relativistic mean field, which has a form similar to the widely used M3Y potential. We focused on the fusion cross-sections for $Oxygen$-based reactions with targets from different mass regions of the periodic table i.e. $^{16}$O + $^{24}$Mg, $^{18}$O + $^{24}$Mg, $^{16}$O + $^{148}$Sm, $^{16}$O + $^{176}$Hf, $^{16}$O + $^{176}$Yb, $^{16}$O + $^{182}$W, and $^{16}$O + $^{186}$W.

To study the surface properties of finite nuclei with these parameterizations, we have adopted the coherent density fluctuation model, which effectively translates the quantities of nuclear matter from momentum space to coordinate space at local density. The isospin properties, such as symmetry energy and its surface and volume components, slope parameter, finite nuclear incompressibility, and surface incompressibility for even-even nuclei, are calculated for different mass regions.

While nuclear spin-free materials, such as isotopically purified silicon, exhibit intrinsically promising coherence properties for electron spin qubits, the omnipresent charge noise, when converted to magnetic noise under a strong magnetic field gradient, often hinders stable qubit operation within a time frame comparable to the data acquisition time. Here, we demonstrate both open- and closed-loop suppression techniques for the transduced noise in silicon spin qubits, resulting in a more than two-fold (ten-fold) improvement of the inhomogeneous coherence time (Rabi oscillation quality) that leads to a single-qubit gate fidelity of over 99.6% even in the presence of a strong decoherence field gradient. Utilizing gate set tomography, we show that adaptive qubit control also reduces the non-Markovian noise in the system, which validates the stability of the gate fidelity. The technique can be used to learn multiple Hamiltonian parameters and is useful for the intermittent calibration of the circuit parameters with affordable experimental overhead, providing a useful subroutine during the repeated execution of general quantum circuits.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 05:44:23 UTC (1,235 KB)"

In this process an antineutrino produced by a nucleus undergoing beta decay, $X \to Y + e^- + \bar \nu_e$, is absorbed as a neutrino by another identical $X$ nucleus via the inverse beta decay reaction, $\nu_e + X \to e^-+Y$. The distinct signature of MDBD is that the total kinetic energy of the two electrons equals twice the endpoint energy of single beta decay. The amplitude for MDBD, a coherent sum over the contribution of different mass states of the intermediate neutrinos, reflects quantum coherence over macroscopic distances, and is a new macroscopic quantum effect. We evaluate the rate of MDBD for a macroscopic sample of ``$X$"" material, e.g., tritium, acting both as the source and the target. The accidental background for MDBD originating from two separate single beta decays, which contains two final state neutrinos, can be readily rejected by measuring the energy of the detected two electrons.

However, to move forward, we need to look for other reactions, such as Timelike Compton Scattering (TCS), its ""time-reversal"" equivalent. Indeed, accessing GPDs from both DVCS and TCS independently will allow us, for instance, to study their universality. Any assesment on GPD's universality would be a milestone in our field. In this article we discuss our preliminary studies on the feasibility of measuring unpolarized and beam polarized cross sections and beam spin asymmetry for TCS in the dilepton photoproduction reaction. For that purpose, we use a polarized photon beam and an unpolarized target at JLab Hall C. We will discuss our Geant4 simulations, with a dedicated detector setup along with the use of the SBS magnet for separating outgoing $e^{+}$, $e^{-}$ pairs.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 01:55:36 UTC (4,216 KB)"
"75","Shell Effects in Quasi-fission in Reactions Forming 226Th Compound Nucleus","Hyeonseop Lee, Patrick McGlynn, Cedric Simenel","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","Quasi-fission (QF) reactions occur in fully damped heavy-ion collisions without the formation of an equilibrated compound nucleus, leading to the formation of fragments with similar properties as in fission reactions. Similar shell effects are expected to affect fragment formation in both fission and QF. Our purpose is to investigate QF dynamics in different reactions forming the same compound nucleus and search for possible signatures of shell effects in fragment formation. 50Ca+176Yb and 96Zr+130Sn QF reactions are simulated with the time-dependent Hartree-Fock code Sky3D near the Coulomb barrier. Evolutions of the quadrupole (Q20) and octupole (Q30) moments are interpreted in terms of features of the potential energy surface (PES) of the 226Th compound nucleus. Both reactions encounter QF. In 50Ca+176Yb, those only occur at finite angular momenta. In the more symmetric 96Zr+130Sn reaction with stronger Coulomb repulsion in the entrance channel, QF also occurs in central collisions. In agreement with earlier predictions, 50Ca+176Yb encounters partial mass equilibration that is stopped when the heavy fragment reaches Z~54 protons, as in the asymmetric fission mode of 226Th. 96Zr+130Sn encounters an inverse QF also leading to similar fragments as in asymmetric fission. In both systems, QF trajectories in the Q20-Q30 plane follow the asymmetric fission valley of 226Th PES. The observation of an inverse QF is a clear prediction that shell effects have a strong influence in QF. The similarity between fragments formed in asymmetric fission and QF supports the idea that the same shell effects are at play in both mechanisms. Interpreting QF dynamics with PES used in fission is naturally limited by the fact that these PES are usually computed with axial symmetry, no angular momentum and no excitation energy, thus motivating future developments of PES for QF.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 23:29:09 UTC (15,860 KB)"

The quark-meson model is analyzed at one-loop that is the minimal order to include quark substructure constraints on pions which condense at finite isospin density. In the previous study we showed that the quark-meson model at zero temperature produces the sound velocity peak and the negative trace anomaly in the domain between the chiral effective theory regime at low density and the perturbative QCD regime at high density, in reasonable agreement with lattice simulations. We now include thermal effects from quarks in the Polyakov loop background and examine EOS, especially the sound velocity and trace anomaly along isentropic trajectories. At large isospin density, there are three temperature windows; (i) the pion condensed region with almost vanishing Polyakov loops, (ii) the pion condensed region with finite Polyakov loops, and (iii) the quark gas without pion condensates. In the domain (i), the gap associated with the pion condensate strongly quenches thermal excitations. As the system approaches the domain (ii), thermal quarks, which behave as non-relativistic particles, add energy density but little pressure, substantially reducing the sound velocity to the value less than the conformal value while increasing the trace anomaly toward the positive value. Approaching the domain (iii), thermal quarks become more relativistic as pion condensates melt, increasing sound velocity toward the conformal limit. Corrections from thermal pions are also briefly discussed.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 23:16:28 UTC (2,904 KB)"

Mota","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)","Within the context of Rastall gravity, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium and dynamical stability against radial pulsations of compact stars, where a free parameter $\beta$ measures the deviations from General Relativity (GR). We derive both the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations and the Sturm-Liouville differential equation governing the adiabatic radial oscillations. Such equations are solved numerically in order to obtain the compact-star properties for two realistic equations of state (EoSs). For hadronic matter, the fundamental mode frequency $\omega_0$ becomes unstable almost at the critical central energy density corresponding to the maximum gravitational mass. However, for quark matter, where larger values of $\vert\beta\vert$ are required to observe appreciable changes in the mass-radius diagram, there exist stable stars after the maximum-mass configuration for negative values of $\beta$. Using an independent analysis, our results reveal that the emergence of a cusp can be used as a criterion to indicate the onset of instability when the binding energy is plotted as a function of the proper mass. Specifically, we find that the central-density value where the binding energy is a minimum corresponds precisely to $\omega_0^2 =0$.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 19:40:54 UTC (251 KB)"

Since these cumulants of conserved charges are expected to be sensitive to the existence of a critical point in the phase diagram of nuclear matter, it is crucial to ensure that the proxies used as substitutes are as close to them as possible. Hence, we use the EPOS4 framework to generate Au+Au collisions at several collision energies of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan. We compute $2^\text{nd}$ order net-cumulants of $\pi$, $K$ and $p$, for which experimental data has been published, as well as the corresponding conserved charge cumulants. We then compare them with proxies, defined in previous lattice QCD and Hadron Resonance Gas model studies, which are shown to reproduce more accurately their associated conserved charge cumulants. We investigate the impact of hadronic re-scatterings occurring in the late evolution of the system on these quantities, as well as the amount of signal actually originating from the bulk medium which endures a phase transition.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 18:43:18 UTC (1,490 KB)"

Namely, we approach this issue starting from a realistic nucleon-nucleon potential and deriving effective Hamiltonians and decay operators. Our goal is to explore the sensitivity of the shape of calculated energy spectra to the renormalization of forbidden $\beta$ -decay operators, an operation that allows to take into account those configurations that are not explicitly included in the chosen model space. The region that has been considered for this investigation are nuclei outside the $^{78}$Ni core, more precisely we have studied the second-forbidden $\beta$ decays of $^{94}$Nb and $^{99}$Tc, and fourth-forbidden $\beta$ decays of $^{113}$Cd and $^{115}$In, that are currently of a renewed experimental interest in terms of novel spectroscopic techniques. Our results evidence that the introduction of a renormalized $\beta$-decay operator leads to a marked improvement of the reproduction of experimental half-lives. As regards the spectra of both second-forbidden and fourth-forbidden decays, we have found that their calculated shapes are in good agreement with the observed ones, even if scarcely responsive to the renormalization of the decay operator. We carry out also a detailed inspection of the different components of the calculated spectra for a deeper insight about their role in reproducing the experimental shapes.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 17:58:48 UTC (289 KB)"

Additionally, we assume that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the reaction plane, which corresponds to the $y$ direction. The fluid is considered to have infinite electrical conductivity. To analyze this system, we solve the coupled Maxwell and conservation equations.

In the frame of the effective Schrodinger-like equation, which is derived exactly from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in quantum electrodynamics, we express the effective potential corresponding to the full one-photon-exchange interaction in terms of eight scalar functions. Unlike the usual calculations performed in the references, where the effective potential is expanded in terms of momenta order by order, we retain the exact momentum dependence in the effective potential to estimate its corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen using a highly precise numerical method. We also use the same numerical method to double-check the results in the non-relativistic case to ensure accuracy. We discuss the comparison of the numerical results with those obtained using the usual bound-state perturbative theory. Our calculations suggest that it is possible to accurately account for all the relativistic contributions using this method. It would be interesting to extent these calculations to positronium, muonic hydrogen, and cases involving nuclear structure and radiative corrections.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 12:53:35 UTC (33 KB)[v2] Thu, 7 Mar 2024 00:36:06 UTC (84 KB)"

Meanwhile, we investigate 28 different versions of the proximity potential formalisms, which are the most complete known proximity potential formalisms and have been proposed for the description of proton radioactivity, two-proton radioactivity, {\alpha} decay, heavy-ion radioactivity, quasi-elastic scattering, fusion reactions and other applications. The calculated results show that the modified forms of proximity potential 1977 denoted as Prox.77-12 and the proximity potential 1981 denoted as Prox.81 are the most appropriate proximity potential formalisms for the study of cluster radioactivity as the root-mean-square deviation between experimental data and relevant theoretical results obtained are least and the both values are 0.681. For comparison, a universal decay law (UDL) proposed by Qi et al. [Phys. Rev. C 80, 044326 (2009)], a unified formula of half-lives for {\alpha} decay and cluster radioactivity proposed by Ni et al.

The $J/\Psi$-N potential,$V_{J/\Psi N}(r)$,is constructed by folding $v_{cN}$ into the wavefunction $\Phi_{J/\Psi}(c\bar{c})$ of $J/\Psi$ within a Constituent Quark Model(CQM) of Ref.[43]. A photo-production amplitude is also generated by $v_{cN}$ by a $c\bar{c}$-loop integration over the $\gamma\rightarrow c\bar{c}$ vertex function and $\Phi_{J/\Psi}(c\bar{c})$. No commonly used Vector Meson Dominance assumption is used to define this photo-production amplitude which is needed to describe the data near the threshold. The potential $v_{cN}(r)$ is parameterized in a form such that the predicted $V_{J/\Psi N}(r)$ at large distances has the same Yukawa potential form extracted from a Lattice QCD(LQCD) calculation of Ref.[18]. The parameters of $v_{cN}$ are determined by fitting the total cross section data of JLab by performing calculations that include $J/\Psi$-N final state interactions(FSI). The resulting differential cross sections are found in good agreements with the data. It is shown that the FSI effects dominate the cross section in the very near threshold region, allowing for sensitive testing of the predicted $J/\Psi$-N scattering amplitudes. By imposing the constraints of $J/\Psi$-N potential extracted from the LQCD calculation, we have obtained three $J/\Psi$-N potentials which fit the JLab data equally well. The resulting $J/\Psi$-N scattering lengths are in the range of $a=(-0.05$ fm $\sim$ $-0.25$ fm). With the determined $v_{cN}(r)$ and the wavefunctions generated from the same CQM, the constructed model is used to predict the cross sections of photo-production of $\eta_c(1S)$ and $\Psi(2S)$ mesons for future experimental tests.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 11:52:42 UTC (640 KB)"

The detection of ZULF NMR signals in samples with natural abundance remains a challenging endeavor, due to the limited sensitivity of NMR detectors and thermal polarization. In this work, we demonstrate a femtotesla potassium spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer designed for ZULF NMR detection. A potassium vapor cell with high buffer gas pressure and high atomic number density is used in the magnetometer. With absorption spectroscopy and SERF effect, the key parameters of the vapor cell are characterized and applied to optimize the magnetometer sensitivity. To combine our SERF magnetometer and ZULF NMR detection, a custom-made vacuum chamber is employed to keep NMR sample close to the magnetometer cell and protect the sample from undesired heating effects. Gradiometric measurement is performed to greatly reduce the magnetic noise. With the phase calibration applied, the gradiometric measurement achieves 7-fold enhancement in magnetic-field sensitivity compared to the single channel and has a magnetic noise floor of 1.2 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$.

We extend a microscopic 3$\alpha$ cluster-model to include isospin 1 impurity components, and take into account both isovector and isoscalar electirc dipole operators. Several sets of $2^+$ and $3^-$ wave functions are generated by solving a radius-constrained equation of motion with the stochastic variational method, resulting in reproducing very well the electric quadrupole and octupole transition probabilities to the ground state.

The experimental and theoretical identification of the P-wave dimeson state holds paramount importance in enhancing our comprehension of the non-perturbative QCD and few-body physics. Its existence is firmly established in a unified meson-exchange model which simultaneously depicts the features of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, $Z_c(3900)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. This scenario can be directly examined in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ cross section to see whether a resonance exists at the threshold. The credibility of the investigations is also ensured by the fact that the P-wave interaction dominantly arises from the well-known long-range pion exchange. Additionally, the existence of the P-wave resonance only depends on the interaction strength and is less sensitive to the potential shapes. We extensively calculate all systems up to P-wave with various quantum numbers and predict a dense population of the $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ and $DD^*$ states, where the S-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ state with $I^G (J^{PC})=0^- (1^{+-})$, P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ state with $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(0^{-+})$, and P-wave $DD^*$ state with $I(J^P)=0(0^-)$ are more likely to be observed in experiments.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 04:36:51 UTC (390 KB)"

Mass analysis of the intercalated compounds, EMIM$_x$-FePS$_3$ and EMIM$_x$-NiPS$_3$, indicated respective intercalation levels, $x$, of approximately 27\% and 37\%, and X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrated a massive (over 50\%) enhancement of the $c$-axis lattice parameters. To investigate the consequences of these changes for the magnetic properties, we performed magnetic susceptibility and $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of both systems. For EMIM$_x$-FePS$_3$, intercalation reduces the magnetic ordering temperature from $T_N = 120$~K to 78~K, and we find a spin gap in the antiferromagnetic phase that drops from 45~K to 30~K. For EMIM$_x$-NiPS$_3$, the ordering temperature is almost unaffected (changing from 148~K to 145~K), but a change towards nearly isotropic spin fluctuations suggests an alteration of the magnetic Hamiltonian. Such relatively modest changes, given that the huge extension of the $c$ axes is expected to cause a very strong suppression any interlayer interactions, point unequivocally to the conclusion that the magnetic properties of both parent compounds are determined solely by two-dimensional (2D), intralayer physics. The changes in transition temperatures and low-temperature spin dynamics in both compounds therefore indicate that intercalation also results in a significant modulation of the intralayer magnetic interactions, which we propose is due to charge doping and localization on the P sites. Our study offers chemical intercalation with ionic liquids as an effective method to control not only the interlayer but also the intralayer interactions in quasi-2D magnetic materials.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 04:03:31 UTC (2,889 KB)"

Two values for the nucleon effective mass, $M^*_{N0}/M_N=0.556,~0.70$ at the saturation density are chosen based on the consideration of the core-collapse supernova simulation and finite nuclei when the meson-nucleon coupling constants are fixed. We find that the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the symmetry energy, the mass-radius relations, and the tidal deformabilities of neutron stars with larger nucleon effective mass are more sensitive to the skewness coefficient $J_0$. The EOSs with $M^*_{N0}/M_N=0.70$ are softer when the skewness coefficient $J_0=-800$ MeV. However, the maximum masses of the neutron star can be around $2.32M_\odot$ with $J_0=400$ MeV regardless of the value of the nucleon effective mass. By manipulating the coupling strength of the isovector meson to generate different slopes of symmetry energy, we construct the neutron star EOSs that can satisfy the different variables from the simultaneous mass-radius measurements of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620 by the NICER collaboration, the mass-radius relations of HESS J1731-347, and the radius constraints from the gravitational-wave signal GW170817 in the framework of DDQMF model.

However, the recent analysis of the $\alpha$ knockout reaction on $^{48}$Ti [Phys. Rev. C 103, L031305 (2021)] poses a puzzle: The microscopic wave function gives an $\alpha$ knockout cross section that is two orders of magnitude smaller than the experiment, while basic nuclear properties such as the charge radius and the electromagnetic transition probabilities are well explained. Purpose: The ground-state structure of $^{48}$Ti is investigated by using proton- and $\alpha$-nucleus elastic scattering at a few to several hundred MeV, which offers different sensitivity to the region of the nuclear density profiles. Method: Four types of density distributions, the $jj$-coupling shell model and three cluster model configurations, are generated in a single scheme by the antisymmetrized quasi-cluster model (AQCM). The angular distribution of the proton- and $\alpha$-$^{48}$Ti elastic scattering cross sections are obtained with a reliable high-energy reaction theory, the Glauber model. Results: The $jj$-coupling shell model configuration is found to best reproduce the proton-nucleus elastic scattering cross section. On the other hand, the trace of the $\alpha$ cluster structure in the tail region of the wave function is embedded in the $\alpha$-nucleus elastic scattering cross section. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the structure of the nucleus changes as a function of distance from the center, from the $jj$-coupling shell model structure in the surface region to the $\alpha$+$^{44}$Ca cluster structure in the tail region. This picture is consistent with the finding of the $\alpha$ knockout reaction on $^{48}$Ti.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 02:35:05 UTC (81 KB)"

Ryazanov","Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)","Based on the theory of hierarchical structures, a correspondence has been established between the dynamics for the number of neutrons obtained from the theory of branching processes, the number of neutrons of the n-th generation, the number of nodes at the n-th level of the hierarchy, the rate of change in the probability of a chain reaction, the type of intensity and strength of the hierarchical connection, the degree reactor criticality, and neutron trajectories in the reactor. A connection has been found between the probabilities of the formation of a certain generation of the number of neutrons and the probability of the occurrence of a self-sustaining chain reaction of nuclear fission. It is shown that the Tsallis and RÃ©nyi distributions describing these processes are related by relations of deformed algebra, and under certain conditions can be accompanying with respect to each other.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 09:57:43 UTC (429 KB)"

Grygoriev","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a liquid drop for the equilibrium at zero temperature, $T=0$, is formulated for derivations of the equation of state (EoS) for the pressure $P=P(\rho)$, the particle number density $\rho$, and the NS mass $M$ expressions in the leptodermic approximation $a/R \ll 1$, where $a$ is the diffused NS effective surface (ES), and $R$ is the effective NS radius. The macroscopic gravitation is taken into account in terms of the potential $\Phi(\rho)$ as a second order expansion in powers of $\rho-\overline{\rho} $, where $\overline{\rho}$ is the saturation density. The density distribution $\rho$ across the NS ES in the normal direction to the ES was obtained analytically for a general form of the energy density $\mathcal{E}(\rho)$, in the leading order of the approximation $a/R \ll 1$ for both spherical and deformed ES shapes. For a spherically symmetric NS and its typical parameters such as a crust thickness, $a \sim 1$ km, effective radii, $R\sim 10$ km, and central particle-number density (saturation) value, $\overline{\rho} \sim 2\cdot 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$, we find the leading expression for the particle number density $\rho$. The surface NS mass correction $M_{\rm S}$ to the volume part, $M_{\rm V}$, is found as $M_{\rm S} \approx - (2a/R) M_{\rm V}$. The analytical solution to the Tolman-Oppenhamer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for the pressure $P$ at different typical experimentally known N masses, $M=(1.4-2.0) M_\odot$, is in good agreement with the corresponding numerical results. As shown from their comparison with our EoS pressure, $P=P(\rho)$, we emphasize importance of its surface corrections $P_{\rm S}$ near the NS edge.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 08:57:49 UTC (490 KB)"

Our results show that for some incident scattering angles in the body-fixed frame, the relative difference in intersystem crossing reaction probabilities (as determined between spin up and spin down initial states) can be as large as 15%. Our findings are an ab initio demonstration of spin-dependent nonadiabatic dynamics which we hope will shine light as far as understanding the chiral-induced spin selectivity effect.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 19:01:19 UTC (1,291 KB)"
"99","Analyzing the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in kinetic theory framework with a novel approach to the collision integral","Shubhalaxmi Rath, Sadhana Dash","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)","In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium are likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Knudsen number, elliptic flow, specific heat at constant pressure, specific heat at constant volume, trace anomaly, thermal diffusion constant and isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the angular velocity plays an important role and enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 16:03:53 UTC (86 KB)"

The UE are defined as those aspects of proton-proton collisions that are not attributed to the primary hard scattering process, but rather to the accompanying interactions of the rest of the proton. The conventional approach of studying underlying events is usually carried out by defining topological regions with respect to the leading particle in an event. The transverse region is generally sensitive to UE and various classifiers have been used to discriminate the extent of UE activity regions. The production of identified particles like $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, p , $K_{S}^{0}$, and $\Lambda^{0}$ are studied in different ranges of transverse activity classifier in p$-$p collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13 $ TeV using pQCD inspired PYTHIA 8 event generator. A comparative analysis of the identified particle spectra, mean multiplicity and mean transverse momentum has been carried out with respect to $S_{T}$ and the performance of this new observable is gauged by comparing the results with previously defined $R_{T}$ observable.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 14:45:50 UTC (919 KB)"

Our focus centers on exploring the potential $S=+1$ resonance $P^{+*}_0\equiv P^*_0$ as an excited state within the extended vector-meson and baryon ($VB$) antidecuplet. To achieve this aim, we employ the effective Lagrangian method in conjunction with the $(u,t)$-channel Regge approach, operating within the tree-level Born approximation. We thoroughly examine various spin-parity quantum numbers for the resonance, resulting in a compelling description of the data, where $M_{P^*_0}\approx2.5$ GeV and $\Gamma_{P^*_0}\approx100$ MeV. Furthermore, we propose an experimental technique to amplify the signal-to-noise ratio ($S/N$) for accurately measuring the resonance. Notably, our findings reveal that background interference diminishes significantly within the $K^*$ forward-scattering region in the center-of-mass frame when the $K^*$ is perpendicularly polarized to the reaction plane. Additionally, we explore the recoil-proton spin asymmetry to definitively determine the spin and parity of the resonance. This study stands to serve as a valuable reference for designing experimental setups aimed at investigating and comprehending exotic phenomena in QCD.

The comparison with model predictions allows us to discriminate among different approaches for heavy quark production and hadronization, as well as different treatments of the underlying event employed by the models to reproduce correlation observables. In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, where a deconfined state of matter, the quark--gluon plasma (QGP), is created, heavy-flavor correlations can shed light on the modification of the heavy quark fragmentation due to the interaction between charm and beauty quarks with the QGP constituents, as well as characterize their energy loss processes while traversing the medium. Insight into the possible emergence of collective-like mechanisms in smaller systems, resembling those observed in heavy-ion collisions, can also be obtained by performing correlation studies in high-multiplicity proton--proton and proton--nucleus collisions. In this review, the most recent and relevant measurements of heavy-flavor correlations performed in all collision systems at the LHC and RHIC will be presented, and the new understandings that they provide will be discussed.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 23:51:41 UTC (2,383 KB)"

However, the presence of numerical artifacts at electronic degeneracies, such as complex energies, has made it difficult to apply it in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. While it has already been shown that such numerical artifacts can be fully removed by using similarity constrained coupled cluster (SCC) theory [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2017, 8, 19, 4801-4807], simulating dynamics requires efficient implementations of gradients and nonadiabatic couplings.

We aim to do a detailed orbital analysis of stars located in the nuclear stellar disc (NSD) of the Milky Way allowing us to trace the dynamical history of this structure. We integrated orbits of the observed stars in a non-axisymmetric potential. We used a Fourier transform to estimate the orbital frequencies. We compared two orbital classifications, one made by eye and the other with an algorithm, in order to identify the main orbital families. We also compared the Lyapunov and the frequency drift techniques to estimate the chaoticity of the orbits. We identified several orbital families as chaotic, $z$-tube, $x$-tube, banana, fish, saucer, pretzel, 5:4, and 5:6 orbits. As expected for stars located in a NSD, the large majority of orbits are identified as $z$-tubes (or as a sub-family of $z$-tubes). Since the latter are parented by $x_{2}$ orbits, this result supports the contribution of the bar (in which $x_{2}$ orbits are dominant in the inner region) in the formation of the NSD. Moreover, most of the chaotic orbits are found to be contaminants from the bar or bulge which would confirm the predicted contamination from the most recent NSD models. Based on a detailed orbital analysis, we were able to classify orbits into various families, most of which are parented by $x_{2}$-type orbits, which are dominant in the inner part of the bar.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 18:59:01 UTC (2,084 KB)"

Nunes","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","Background: Analyses of elastic scattering with the optical model (OMP) are widely used in nuclear reactions. Purpose: Previous work compared a traditional frequentist approach and a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainties in the OMP. In this study, we revisit this comparison and consider the role of the likelihood used in the analysis. Method: We compare the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for $\chi^{2}$ minimization with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to obtain parameter posteriors. Following previous work, we consider how results are affected when $\chi^{2}$/N is used for the likelihood function, N being the number of data points, to account for possible correlations in the model and underestimation of the error in the data. Results: We analyze a simple linear model and then move to OMP analysis of elastic angular distributions using a) a 5-parameter model and b) a 6-parameter model. In the linear model, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches yield consistent optima and uncertainty estimates. The same is qualitatively true for the 5-parameter OMP analysis. For the 6-parameter OMP analysis, the parameter posterior is no longer well-approximated by a Gaussian and a covariance-based frequentist prediction becomes unreliable. In all cases, when the Bayesian approach uses $\chi^{2}$/N in the likelihood, uncertainties increase by $\sqrt{N}$. Conclusions: When the parameter posterior is near-Gaussian and the same likelihood is used, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches recover consistent parameter uncertainty estimates. If the parameter posterior has significant higher moments, the covariance-only frequentist approach becomes unreliable and the Bayesian approach should be used. Empirical coverage can serve as an important internal check for uncertainty estimation, providing red flags for uncertainty analyses.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 18:52:47 UTC (4,852 KB)"

In this work, we investigate the hyperfine interaction between the spin-charge coupled transport of electrons and the nuclear spins in these surface states. Previous work has predicted that in the quantum spin Hall insulator phase, work can be extracted from a bath of polarized nuclear spins as a resource. We employ nonequilibrium Green's function analysis to show that a similar effect exists on the surface of a 3D topological insulator, albeit rescaled by the ratio between electronic mean free path and device length. The induced current due to thermal relaxation of polarized nuclear spins has an inductive nature. We emphasize the inductive response by rewriting the current-voltage relation in harmonic response as a lumped element model containing two parallel resistors and an inductor. In a low-frequency analysis, a universal inductance value emerges that is only dependent on the device's aspect ratio. This scaling offers a means of miniaturizing inductive circuit elements. An efficiency estimate follows from comparing the spin-flip induced current to the Ohmic contribution. The inductive effect is most prominent in topological insulators which have a large number of spinful nuclei per coherent segment, of which the volume is given by the mean free path length, Fermi wavelength and penetration depth of the surface state.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 17:55:52 UTC (1,230 KB)"

Also for the first time, we utilize the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF correlator without a Wilson line.

Although particle-antiparticle [$D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^+$ versus $D^{(\ast)}_{s0,s1}(2317,2460)^-$] lineshapes are the same in vacuum, we find extremely different density patterns in matter. This charge-conjugation asymmetry mainly stems from the very different kaon and antikaon interaction with the nucleons of the dense medium. We show that the in-medium lineshapes found for these resonances strongly depend on their $D^{(*)}K$/$\overline{D}{}^{(*)}\overline{K}$ molecular content, and discuss how this novel feature can be used to better determine/constrain the inner structure of these exotic states.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 11:19:17 UTC (1,488 KB)"
"120","Production of Resonances in Partial Chemical Equilibrium","Boris Tomasik, Sandor Lokos","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","Within the model of partial chemical equilibrium (PCE) we calculate the multiplicity ratios of selected unstable resonances to given stable species. We focus on those ratios that have been measured either in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC or in Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy. The model provides an interpretation how in an expanding hadronic fireball with decreasing temperature the final numbers of stable hadrons after decays of all resonances remain unchanged. Each stable species acquires its own chemical potential and the resonances are kept in equilibrium with them. Multiplicities of unstable resonances provide a test of this scenario. We observe that the ratios of $K^{*}/K$ and $\rho^0/\pi$ fit reasonably well into the picture of single kinetic freeze-out of the single-particle spectra, but the $\phi$-meson and hyperon resonances are not reproduced by this model.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 10:26:28 UTC (305 KB)"

For the extracted in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections, our results show that it will be enhanced 1.1$-$2.5 times than that with the conventional Pauli blocking method at the beam energy less than 150 MeV/u, which highlights the importance of a refined Pauli blocking method for developing an advanced transport model to describe complex heavy ion collisions.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 08:12:46 UTC (1,173 KB)"

Steiner, Fridolin Weber, Daniel Whiteson","High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)","Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 05:14:37 UTC (3,449 KB)"

"124","Five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian with improved inertial functions","Kouhei Washiyama, Nobuo Hinohara, Takashi Nakatsukasa","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","Background: To describe shape fluctuations associated with large-amplitude collective motion in the quadrupole degrees of freedom, the five-dimensional collective Hamiltonian (5DCH) has been widely used. The inertial functions in the 5DCH are microscopically calculated with the energy density functional (EDF) theory employing the cranking formula. However, since the cranking formula ignores dynamical residual effects, it is known to fail to reproduce the correct inertial functions, for instance, the total mass for the translational motion. Purpose: We aim to resolve problems of the insufficient description of the inertial functions in the 5DCH. We provide a practical method to include the dynamical residual effects in the inertial functions that depend on the quadrupole deformation parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$. Methods: We use the local quasiparticle random-phase approximation (LQRPA) based on the constrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov states in the $\beta$--$\gamma$ plane with the Skyrme EDF. The finite-amplitude method is used for efficient computations of the LQRPA. Results: The inertial functions evaluated with the LQRPA significantly increase from the ones with the cranking formula due to the dynamical residual effects. This increase also shows a strong $\beta$--$\gamma$ dependence. We show an application of the present method to a transitional nucleus $^{110}$Pd. The low-lying positive-parity spectra are well reproduced with the LQRPA inertial functions. Conclusions: We clarify the importance of the dynamical residual effects in the inertial functions of the 5DCH for the description of the low-lying spectra. The 5DCH with the improved inertial functions provides a reliable and efficient description of low-lying spectra in nuclei associated with the quadrupole shape fluctuation.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 01:22:51 UTC (691 KB)"

The paradigmatic example employed here is the scalar isoscalar $f_0(980)$ resonance that couples to the lighter $\pi\pi$ and heavier $K\bar{K}$ channels. It is shown that the decay width is given by the sum or subtraction of the partial decay widths depending on whether the pole lies in the Riemann sheet that is contiguous with the physical one above or below the $K\bar{K}$ threshold, respectively. Next, we show that the usually disregarded renormalization of bare parameters in FlattÃ© or energy-dependent Breit-Wigner parameterizations is essential to extract physical information. The compositeness of the $f_0(980)$ by using a FlattÃ© parameterization matched to reproduce the pole properties obtained from Roy equations and other analytic constraints is evaluated.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 21:32:51 UTC (18 KB)"

The energy spectrum and wavefunction overlap variation as a function of dopant separation for these arrays shows that hybridization mostly occurs between single-dopant states of the same type, with some cross-hybridization between $A_1$ and $E$ states occurring at short separations. We also observe energy crossings between hybrid states of different types as a function of impurity separation. We then extract tunneling rates for electrons in different dopants by mapping the state energies into hopping Hamiltonians in the site representation. Significantly, we find that diagonal and nearest neighbor tunneling rates are similar in magnitude in a square array. Our analysis also accounts for the shift of the on-site energy at each phosphorus atom resulting from the nuclear potential of the other dopants.

The frequency dependence of the opacity of matter is chosen to mimic the relaxation time of a self-interacting scalar field. In this way, the transient sector simulates that of a realistic quantum field theory. As expected, the gradient series is divergent for most flows. We identify the mechanism at the origin of the divergence, and we provide a successful regularization scheme. Additionally, we propose a universal qualitative framework for predicting the breakdown of the gradient expansion of an arbitrary microscopic system undergoing a given flow. This framework correctly predicts the factorial divergence of the gradient expansion in most non-linear flows and its breakdown due to stochastic fluctuations. It also predicts that jets may induce an ultraviolet divergence in the gradient expansion of quark matter hydrodynamics.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 16:49:10 UTC (166 KB)"

In this paper, we propose embedding a Double Quantum Dot (DQD) Josephson junction in parallel with a transmon to enable circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) measurements and operation of a YSR bond qubit. We demonstrate that, under realistic parameters, two-tone spectroscopy of the DQD can be performed, revealing a significant parameter regime suitable for qubit operation. Additionally, coherent manipulations of the bond states can be achieved through dot gates, and single-shot readout is enabled by measurements of a capacitively coupled resonator. Finally, we analyze noise sources and estimate gate noise on couplings as the primary source of qubit decoherence. Since this qubit is protected against nuclear Overhauser fields and does not rely on spin-orbit interactions for operation, a broader range of material platforms becomes available compared to current Andreev spin qubits.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:31:46 UTC (4,605 KB)"

In addition, there is a pair of complex poles below threshold generated by crossing symmetry (PRD 108, 034009). We use the $N/D$ method to partially recover crossing symmetry of the $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model amplitude at leading order of $1/N$ expansion, and qualitatively reproduce the pole structure and pole trajectories with varying pion masses as revealed by Roy-equation analyses. The $\sigma$ pole trajectory with varying temperature is also discussed and found to be similar to its properties when varying $m_\pi$. As the temperature increases, the complex $\sigma$ poles firstly move from the second Riemann sheet to the real axis becoming two virtual state poles, and then one virtual state pole moves to the first sheet turning into a bound state pole and finally tends to the pion pole position at high temperature which is as expected from the chiral symmetry restoration. Our results provide further evidences that the lowest $f_0$ state extracted from experiments and lattice data plays the role of $\sigma$ meson in the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry.

Sagawa, Gianluca ColÃ², Myung-Ki Cheoun","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","We investigate the symmetry energy in relation with the two-proton and two-neutron separation energies using different nuclear mass data. For this aim, we exploit the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in the continuum (DRHBc), FRDM2012 and AME2020 data. First, we study the two-proton and two-neutron separation energies in Pb and Ca isotopes by subtracting the contribution of Coulomb energy. They show a strong correlation with neutron number as well as with the neutron skin thickness. By taking the relative difference of both separation energies, we derive the symmetry energy from Ca and Pb isotopes. Since the nuclear surface contributes to the symmetry energy, we deduce the volume symmetry energy by subtracting the surface contribution using several mass models. The obtained symmetry energy coefficient, $a_{sym}$, is 20.0 $\sim $ 22.7 MeV for Pb isotopes and 18.7 $\sim$ 19.3 MeV for Ca isotopes from the DRHBc mass table data, while the results from other mass tables are 19.6 $\sim$ 22.1 (20.7 $\sim$ 22.3) MeV for Pb isotopes and 18.9 $\sim$ 19.0 (19.6 $\sim$ 19.7) MeV for Ca isotopes from AME2020 (FRDM2012) data. The volume contribution to the asymmetry coefficient, $a_{sym}^v$, which depends on the ratio of the surface to the volume energy coefficients, $a_s / a_v$, is also provided for each mass model. Since the ratio $a_s / a_v$ is neither determined by nuclear theory, nor by experimental data, we have investigated $a_{sym}^v$ by using the ratio $a_s / a_v$ as a free parameter, and have obtained $a_{sym}^v = $ 27.0 MeV, almost irrespective of nuclear model and isotopic chain, with the ratio $a_s / a_v$ constrained as $a_s / a_v = 1.10 \sim 1.13$.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 14:39:52 UTC (274 KB)"

Conventionally, the quadrupole deformation length of a nucleus, $\delta_{2}$, has often been determined based on a macroscopic model through a deformed nuclear potential with the deformation length $\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$, which is determined to reproduce the nuclear scattering data. This approach assumes $\delta_{2}=\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$ although there is no theoretical foundation. Purpose: We clarify the relationship between $\delta_{2}$ and $\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$ for high-energy heavy-ion scattering systematically to evaluate the validity of the conventional approach to determine the nuclear deformation. Method: The deformation lengths for the $^{12}$C inelastic scattering by $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, and $^{208}$Pb targets at $E/A$ = 50--400 MeV are examined. First, we perform microscopic coupled-channel (CC) calculations to relate $\delta_{2}$ of the deformed density into the inelastic scattering cross section. Second, we use the deformed potential model to determine $\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$ so as to reproduce the microscopic CC result. We then compare $\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$ with $\delta_{2}$. Results: We find that $\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$ is about 20--40% smaller than presumed $\delta_{2}$, showing strong energy and target dependence. Conclusion: Our results suggest that one needs to be careful when the deformed potential model for the high-energy heavy-ion scattering is used to extract the nuclear deformation. The conventional approach may underestimate the deformation length $\delta_2$ systematically.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 10:04:39 UTC (149 KB)"

The impact of b-quarks and the mesons spans a spectrum of interesting domains regarding the physics of QCD at finite temperature, encompassing the QCD phase transition, color screening, quarkonia dissociation, heavy quark energy loss and collective flow, anisotropic aspects, and strongly coupled nature of hot QCD medium. These aspects underscore the indispensable nature of B-mesons in the quest to create and explore the complex nature of strong interaction force through the QGP/hot QCD matter.

Lastly, we comment on the application and limitations of gCCE in simulating nuclear-spin induced two-qubit relaxation processes.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 21:46:32 UTC (975 KB)"
"146","Exploring the distribution and impact of bosonic dark matter in neutron stars","Davood Rafiei Karkevandi, Mahboubeh Shahrbaf, Soroush Shakeri, Stefan Typel","High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)","The presence of dark matter (DM) within neutron stars (NSs) can be introduced by different accumulation scenarios in which DM and baryonic matter (BM) may interact only through the gravitational force. In this work, we consider asymmetric self-interacting bosonic DM which can reside as a dense core inside the NS or form an extended halo around it. It is seen that depending on the boson mass ($m_{\chi}$), self-coupling constant ($\lambda$) and DM fraction ($F_{\chi}$), the maximum mass, radius and tidal deformability of NSs with DM admixture will be altered significantly. The impact of DM causes some modifications in the observable features induced solely by the BM component. Here, we focus on the widely used nuclear matter equation of state (EoS) called DD2 for describing NS matter. We show that by involving DM in NSs, the corresponding observational parameters will be changed to be consistent with the latest multi-messenger observations of NSs. It is seen that for $m_{\chi}\gtrsim200$ MeV and $\lambda\lesssim2\pi$, DM admixed NSs with $4\%\lesssim F_{\chi}\lesssim20\%$ are consistent with the maximum mass and tidal deformability constraints.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 20:24:26 UTC (3,631 KB)"
"147","Constraints on the mass of a bosonic dark matter candidate within the DD2Y-T model","Mahboubeh Shahrbaf, Davood Rafiei Karkevandi, Stefan Typel","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","Dark matter remains a topic of ongoing controversy. It has gained attention in the theoretical description of compact objects such as neutron stars with cores of very dense matter. Various candidates have been proposed for dark matter in the scientific literature. Among them, the sexaquark has been identified as a potential bosonic particle capable of being formed in neutron star matter based on its mass characteristics. In this study, we investigate the viability of the sexaquark as a candidate for dark matter, particularly under certain density conditions. Our goal is to address the challenges associated with the formation of a bosonic particle in a highly dense medium without compromising the stability of the neutron star. To achieve this, we introduce a straightforward linear mass shift for the sexaquark within the hadronic equation of state, utilizing a relativistic density functional approach. In our investigation, it is observed that the inclusion of Sexaquark as a candidate for dark matter within the hadronic matter equation of state, although featuring a repulsive interaction with baryonic matter, softens the equation of state. We suppose that the strength of the interaction of dark matter with baryonic matter increases linearly with the baryon density. We observe that raising the effective mass of the Sexaquark, as a result of increasing its vacuum mass, causes an increased stiffening of the equation of state as compared to the case of a constant mass. We determine the lower and upper mass boundaries for this bosonic dark matter based on observational constraints for neutron stars within the DD2Y-T model when a phase transition to quark matter phase is employed.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 20:06:24 UTC (1,303 KB)"
"148","Generator coordinate method with proton--neutron pairing fluctuations and magnetic properties of $N=Z$ odd--odd nuclei","K. Uzawa, N. Hinohara, T. Nakatsukasa","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","Pairing correlations play an important role in a variety of nuclear phenomena. However, a quantitative understanding of proton--neutron $(pn)$ pairing, especially isoscalar $pn$ pairing $(S=1, T=0)$ remains elusive. To clarify the property of $pn$ pairing, we investigate the roles of $pn$ pairing in the $M1$ transition of $N=Z$ odd--odd nuclei. We develop a theoretical model based on the generator coordinate method (GCM) in which the isoscalar and isovector $pn$-pair amplitudes are used as the generator coordinates. Using the particle and the angular-momentum projections, the $pn$-pair GCM well reproduces the $M1$ transition of odd--odd nuclei for the exactly solvable SO(8) model. We apply the method to $N=Z$ odd--odd nuclei and find that the experimental values of $B(M1)$ are well reproduced. We also study the sensitivity of $B(M1)$ to the strength of the isoscalar pairing interaction.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 19:54:32 UTC (305 KB)[v2] Fri, 1 Mar 2024 21:32:54 UTC (305 KB)"
"149","Analytic solutions for the linearized first-order magnetohydrodynamics and implications for causality and stability","Zhe Fang, Koichi Hattori, Jin Hu","Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)","We solve the first-order relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) within the linear-mode analysis performed near an equilibrium configuration in the fluid rest frame. We find two complete sets of analytic solutions for the four and two coupled modes with seven dissipative transport coefficients. The former set has been missing in the literature for a long time. Our method provides a simple and general algorithm for the solution search on an order-by-order basis in the derivative expansion, and can be applied to general sets of hydrodynamic equations. We also find that the small-momentum expansions of the solutions break down when the momentum direction is nearly perpendicular to an equilibrium magnetic field due to the presence of another small quantity, that is, a trigonometric function representing the anisotropy. We elaborate on the angle dependence of the solutions and provide alternative series representations that work near the right angle. Finally, we discuss the issues of causality and stability based on our analytic solutions and recent developments in the literature.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 02:04:03 UTC (209 KB)"
"150","Polarized-deuteron scattering by spin-zero target nuclei at intermediate energies","Valery I. Kovalchuk","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","General analytical expressions for the observables in $dA$-scattering reaction have been derived in the diffraction approximation. The resulting formulas describe the cross section and polarization states of the deuteron when it scattering by nuclei with zero spin in the ground state. The tabulated distributions of the target nucleus density and the realistic deuteron wave functions calculated on the basis of Nijmegen nucleon-nucleon potentials were used. The nucleon-nucleus phases were calculated in the framework of Glauber formalism and making use of the double-folding potential. The calculated cross sections and analyzing powers in elastic scattering of deuterons by $^{16}\text{O}$ and $^{40}\text{Ca}$ nuclei at 700 MeV are compared with the corresponding experimental data.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 17:54:09 UTC (229 KB)"
