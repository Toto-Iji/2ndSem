"1","Nuclear spin relaxation in solid state defect quantum bits via electron-phonon coupling in their optical excited state","Gergő Thiering, Adam Gali","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Optically accessible solid state defect spins are primary platform for quantum information processing where tight control of the electron spin and ancilla nuclear spins is pivotal for the operation. We demonstrate on the exemplary nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond by means of a combined group theory and density functional theory study that spin-phonon relaxation rate of the nitrogen nuclear spin is with several orders of magnitude enhanced by the strong electron-phonon coupling in the optical excited state of the defect. The mechanism is common to other solid state defect spins sharing similar optical excited states with that of the NV center.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:15:19 UTC (251 KB)"
"2","Single-electron states of phosphorus-atom arrays in silicon","Maicol A. Ochoa, Keyi Liu, Michał Zieliński, Garnett W. Bryant","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","We characterize the single-electron energies and the wavefunction structure of arrays with two, three, and four phosphorus atoms in silicon by implementing atomistic tight-binding calculations and analyzing wavefunction overlaps to identify the single-dopant states that hybridize to make the array states. The energy spectrum and wavefunction overlap variation as a function of dopant separation for these arrays shows that hybridization mostly occurs between single-dopant states of the same type, with some cross-hybridization between $A_1$ and $E$ states occurring at short separations. We also observe energy crossings between hybrid states of different types as a function of impurity separation. We then extract tunneling rates for electrons in different dopants by mapping the state energies into hopping Hamiltonians in the site representation. Significantly, we find that diagonal and nearest neighbor tunneling rates are similar in magnitude in a square array. Our analysis also accounts for the shift of the on-site energy at each phosphorus atom resulting from the nuclear potential of the other dopants. This approach constitutes a solid protocol to map the electron energies and wavefunction structure into Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonians needed to implement and validate analog quantum simulations in these devices.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 17:50:30 UTC (712 KB)"
"3","Infinite Order Hydrodynamics: an Analytical Example","Lorenzo Gavassino","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","We construct a kinetic model for matter-radiation interactions where the hydrodynamic gradient expansion can be computed analytically up to infinite order in derivatives, in the fully non-linear regime, and for arbitrary flows. The frequency dependence of the opacity of matter is chosen to mimic the relaxation time of a self-interacting scalar field. In this way, the transient sector simulates that of a realistic quantum field theory. As expected, the gradient series is divergent for most flows. We identify the mechanism at the origin of the divergence, and we provide a successful regularization scheme. Additionally, we propose a universal qualitative framework for predicting the breakdown of the gradient expansion of an arbitrary microscopic system undergoing a given flow. This framework correctly predicts the factorial divergence of the gradient expansion in most non-linear flows and its breakdown due to stochastic fluctuations. It also predicts that jets may induce an ultraviolet divergence in the gradient expansion of quark matter hydrodynamics.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 16:49:10 UTC (166 KB)"
"4","YSR Bond Qubit in a Double Quantum Dot with cQED Operation","Gorm Ole Steffensen, Alfredo Levy Yeyati","Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)","Connecting two half-filled quantum dots to two superconducting leads induces a competition of bonds, with the dots forming either an interdot exchange bond or two individual Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) screening bonds with the leads. Defining a qubit using these singlet parity bonding states provides dot charge noise protection, attributed to the chargeless nature of the screening quasiparticles, and magnetic noise protection, as the bonds guard against magnetic polarization. In this paper, we propose embedding a Double Quantum Dot (DQD) Josephson junction in parallel with a transmon to enable circuit Quantum Electrodynamics (cQED) measurements and operation of a YSR bond qubit. We demonstrate that, under realistic parameters, two-tone spectroscopy of the DQD can be performed, revealing a significant parameter regime suitable for qubit operation. Additionally, coherent manipulations of the bond states can be achieved through dot gates, and single-shot readout is enabled by measurements of a capacitively coupled resonator. Finally, we analyze noise sources and estimate gate noise on couplings as the primary source of qubit decoherence. Since this qubit is protected against nuclear Overhauser fields and does not rely on spin-orbit interactions for operation, a broader range of material platforms becomes available compared to current Andreev spin qubits.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:31:46 UTC (4,605 KB)"
"5","Revisiting $O(N)$ $σ$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures","Yuan-Lin Lyu, Qu-Zhi Li, Zhiguang Xiao, Han-Qing Zheng","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)","Roy-equation analyses on lattice data of $\pi\pi$ scattering phase shifts at $m_\pi=391$MeV reveals that the lowest $f_0$ meson becomes a bound state under this condition. In addition, there is a pair of complex poles below threshold generated by crossing symmetry (PRD 108, 034009). We use the $N/D$ method to partially recover crossing symmetry of the $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model amplitude at leading order of $1/N$ expansion, and qualitatively reproduce the pole structure and pole trajectories with varying pion masses as revealed by Roy-equation analyses. The $\sigma$ pole trajectory with varying temperature is also discussed and found to be similar to its properties when varying $m_\pi$. As the temperature increases, the complex $\sigma$ poles firstly move from the second Riemann sheet to the real axis becoming two virtual state poles, and then one virtual state pole moves to the first sheet turning into a bound state pole and finally tends to the pion pole position at high temperature which is as expected from the chiral symmetry restoration. Our results provide further evidences that the lowest $f_0$ state extracted from experiments and lattice data plays the role of $\sigma$ meson in the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Finally, we also briefly discuss the problems of the effective potential in the situation when $m_\pi$ and temperature get large.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 15:19:03 UTC (959 KB)"
"6","Symmetry Energy from Two-Nucleon Separation Energies of Pb and Ca Isotopes","Myeong-Hwan Mun, Eunja Ha, H. Sagawa, Gianluca Colò, Myung-Ki Cheoun","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","We investigate the symmetry energy in relation with the two-proton and two-neutron separation energies using different nuclear mass data. For this aim, we exploit the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in the continuum (DRHBc), FRDM2012 and AME2020 data. First, we study the two-proton and two-neutron separation energies in Pb and Ca isotopes by subtracting the contribution of Coulomb energy. They show a strong correlation with neutron number as well as with the neutron skin thickness. By taking the relative difference of both separation energies, we derive the symmetry energy from Ca and Pb isotopes. Since the nuclear surface contributes to the symmetry energy, we deduce the volume symmetry energy by subtracting the surface contribution using several mass models. The obtained symmetry energy coefficient, $a_{sym}$, is 20.0 $\sim $ 22.7 MeV for Pb isotopes and 18.7 $\sim$ 19.3 MeV for Ca isotopes from the DRHBc mass table data, while the results from other mass tables are 19.6 $\sim$ 22.1 (20.7 $\sim$ 22.3) MeV for Pb isotopes and 18.9 $\sim$ 19.0 (19.6 $\sim$ 19.7) MeV for Ca isotopes from AME2020 (FRDM2012) data. The volume contribution to the asymmetry coefficient, $a_{sym}^v$, which depends on the ratio of the surface to the volume energy coefficients, $a_s / a_v$, is also provided for each mass model. Since the ratio $a_s / a_v$ is neither determined by nuclear theory, nor by experimental data, we have investigated $a_{sym}^v$ by using the ratio $a_s / a_v$ as a free parameter, and have obtained $a_{sym}^v = $ 27.0 MeV, almost irrespective of nuclear model and isotopic chain, with the ratio $a_s / a_v$ constrained as $a_s / a_v = 1.10 \sim 1.13$.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 14:39:52 UTC (274 KB)"
"7","Radiation Hardness Studies of RPC Based on Diamond-Like Carbon Electrodes for MEG II Experiment","Masato Takahashi, Sei Ban, Weiyuan Li, Atsuhiko Ochi, Wataru Ootani, Atsushi Oya, Hiromu Suzuki, Kensuke Yamamoto","Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)","A novel type of resistive plate chamber, based on diamond-like carbon (DLC) electrodes is under development for background identification in the MEG II experiment. The DLC-RPC is required to have a radiation hardness to mass irradiation since it is planned to be placed in a high-intensity and low-momentum muon beam. In this study, the aging test using a high-intensity X-ray beam was conducted to evaluate the radiation hardness of the DLC-RPC. The accumulated charge due to X-ray irradiation reached about 54 C/cm$^2$, which is approximately half of the one-year irradiation dose expected in the MEG II experiment. As a result, the degradation of the gas gain was observed due to fluorine deposition and insulators formed on the DLC electrodes. In addition, discharges via spacers were also observed repeatedly and interrupted the DLC-RPC operation.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 13:19:04 UTC (22,277 KB)"

Guzey (Jyvaskyla U. and Helsinki Inst. of Phys.), M. Strikman (Penn State U.)","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)","We argue that measurements of forward neutrons from nuclear breakup in inclusive high energy photon-nucleus ($\gamma A$) scattering provide a novel complementary way to study small-$x$ dynamics of QCD in heavy-ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs). Using the leading twist approximation to nuclear shadowing, we calculate the distribution over the number of evaporation neutrons produced in $\gamma Pb$ collisions at the LHC. We demonstrate that it allows one to determine the distribution over the number of wounded nucleons (inelastic collisions), which constrains the mechanism of nuclear shadowing of nuclear parton distributions.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 11:38:54 UTC (286 KB)"
"9","Nuclear medium meson structures from the Schwinger proper-time Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model","Geoffry Gifari, Parada T. P. Hutauruk, Terry Mart","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)","In this paper, we study the nuclear medium modifications of the meson electromagnetic form factors in the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with the help of the Schwinger proper-time regularization scheme to tame loop divergence and simulate the effect of QCD confinement. In our current approach, the meson structure and nuclear medium are constructed in the same NJL model at the quark level. We examine the free space and in-medium charge radii for the kaon and pion, in addition to the spacelike elastic electromagnetic form factors of the kaon and pion as well as their quark-sector form factors, which reflect their internal structure. By comparing to the experimental data, we found that the free space elastic electromagnetic form factors for the mesons are consistent with the data, while the in-medium elastic electromagnetic form factors of the mesons are found to decrease as the nuclear matter density increases, leading to increase of meson charge radius, which is consistent with the prediction of other theory calculations. We also predict the axial nucleon coupling constant $g_A$ in nuclear medium computed via the Goldberger-Treiman relation (GTR), which is crucial for the search for the neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu \beta \beta$).","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 11:21:35 UTC (97 KB)"
"10","Investigation of the determination of nuclear deformation using high-energy heavy-ion scattering","Shin Watanabe, Takenori Furumoto, Wataru Horiuchi, Tadahiro Suhara, Yasutaka Taniguchi","Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)","Background: Nuclear deformation provides a crucial characteristic of nuclear structure. Conventionally, the quadrupole deformation length of a nucleus, $\delta_{2}$, has often been determined based on a macroscopic model through a deformed nuclear potential with the deformation length $\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$, which is determined to reproduce the nuclear scattering data. This approach assumes $\delta_{2}=\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$ although there is no theoretical foundation. Purpose: We clarify the relationship between $\delta_{2}$ and $\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$ for high-energy heavy-ion scattering systematically to evaluate the validity of the conventional approach to determine the nuclear deformation. Method: The deformation lengths for the $^{12}$C inelastic scattering by $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, and $^{208}$Pb targets at $E/A$ = 50--400 MeV are examined. First, we perform microscopic coupled-channel (CC) calculations to relate $\delta_{2}$ of the deformed density into the inelastic scattering cross section. Second, we use the deformed potential model to determine $\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$ so as to reproduce the microscopic CC result. We then compare $\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$ with $\delta_{2}$. Results: We find that $\delta^{\rm (pot)}_{2}$ is about 20--40% smaller than presumed $\delta_{2}$, showing strong energy and target dependence. Conclusion: Our results suggest that one needs to be careful when the deformed potential model for the high-energy heavy-ion scattering is used to extract the nuclear deformation. The conventional approach may underestimate the deformation length $\delta_2$ systematically.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 10:04:39 UTC (149 KB)"
